## About Skywork UniPic

Welcome to the official repository for Skywork UniPic, a groundbreaking series of unified multimodal models designed for advanced image understanding, generation, and editing.  This project offers state-of-the-art capabilities through two distinct modeling paradigms.  Access the original repository on GitHub: [https://github.com/SkyworkAI/UniPic](https://github.com/SkyworkAI/UniPic).

## Key Features:

*   **Text-to-Image Generation:**  Transform descriptive text prompts into stunning, high-fidelity images.
*   **Advanced Image Editing:**  Perform seamless inpainting (filling in missing parts), outpainting (extending images), and object manipulation with exceptional precision.
*   **Robust Image Understanding:**  Gain powerful perception capabilities for a wide range of visual tasks.
*   **Efficient Architectures:**  Benefit from optimized models built for both superior accuracy and practical deployment.

## Model Versions:

*   **UniPic-1.0:** A 1.5B parameter model utilizing unified autoregressive modeling for joint visual understanding and generation.
*   **UniPic-2.0 Series:** Leveraging efficient architectures with Diffusion Post-Training. Includes:
    *   SD3.5M-Kontext
    *   MetaQuery variants
