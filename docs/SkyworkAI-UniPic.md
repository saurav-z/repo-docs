## About Skywork UniPic

Skywork UniPic offers state-of-the-art solutions for a variety of image-related tasks. The models are designed to handle both image understanding and generation using a unified approach. This repository provides access to model weights and official implementations, featuring two main model paradigms:

*   **UniPic-1.0:**  A 1.5B parameter model leveraging **Unified Autoregressive Modeling** for joint visual understanding and generation.
*   **UniPic-2.0 Series:**  Efficient architectures, including *SD3.5M-Kontext* and *MetaQuery* variants, built on **Diffusion Post-Training**, delivering exceptional performance across various tasks.

## Key Features of UniPic

*   **Text-to-Image Generation:**  Create stunning, high-fidelity images from text descriptions.
*   **Image Editing:**  Perform advanced image manipulation, including inpainting, outpainting, and object-level editing.
*   **Image Understanding:**  Robust capabilities for a wide array of visual understanding tasks.
*   **Efficient Architectures:** Optimized for both accuracy and efficient deployment.
