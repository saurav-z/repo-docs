## ðŸ“š Overview of UniPic Models

This repository hosts the model weights and implementations for two primary UniPic modeling paradigms:

*   **UniPic-1.0:**  A 1.5B parameter model utilizing Unified Autoregressive Modeling for joint visual understanding and generation. This allows a single transformer to handle both perception and synthesis tasks.
*   **UniPic-2.0 Series:**  Variants including *SD3.5M-Kontext* and *MetaQuery* based on efficient architectures with diffusion post-training, delivering state-of-the-art performance in text-to-image generation, fine-grained image editing, and multimodal reasoning.
