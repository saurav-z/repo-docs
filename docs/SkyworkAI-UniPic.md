## Overview

Skywork UniPic is a groundbreaking project offering state-of-the-art unified multimodal models. It features two distinct modeling paradigms designed to excel in both image understanding and generation tasks:

*   **UniPic-1.0:** A 1.5B parameter model leveraging **Unified Autoregressive Modeling** for joint visual understanding and generation.
*   **UniPic-2.0 Series:** Efficient architectures incorporating **Diffusion Post-Training**, available in *SD3.5M-Kontext* and *MetaQuery* variants. These models deliver superior performance in text-to-image generation, fine-grained image editing, and advanced multimodal reasoning.

## Key Features

*   **Text-to-Image Generation:** Generate stunning, high-fidelity images directly from text prompts.
*   **Image Editing:** Perform seamless inpainting, outpainting, and object manipulation with ease.
*   **Image Understanding:** Gain robust perception capabilities for a wide range of visual tasks.
*   **Efficient Architecture:** Benefit from optimized architectures, ensuring both accuracy and efficient deployment.
