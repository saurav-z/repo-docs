## Key Highlights of Skywork UniPic

Skywork UniPic offers a comprehensive suite of features, delivering state-of-the-art performance across various image-related tasks:

*   **Text-to-Image Generation:** Transform natural language prompts into stunning, high-fidelity images.
*   **Image Editing:** Seamlessly perform inpainting, outpainting, and precise object manipulation within images.
*   **Image Understanding:** Robust perception capabilities for advanced visual tasks.
*   **Efficient Architectures:** Optimized for both accuracy and efficient deployment.

## Model Overview

Skywork UniPic utilizes two distinct modeling paradigms:

*   **UniPic-1.0:** A 1.5B parameter model leveraging **Unified Autoregressive Modeling** for joint visual understanding and generation. This approach uses a single transformer to handle both perception and synthesis tasks.

*   **UniPic-2.0 Series:** Features efficient architectures with **Diffusion Post-Training**, including *SD3.5M-Kontext* and *MetaQuery* variants.  This series excels in text-to-image generation, fine-grained image editing, and multimodal reasoning.
