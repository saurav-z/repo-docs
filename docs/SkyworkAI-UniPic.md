## Overview

The **Skywork-UniPic** repository provides model weights and implementations for our unified multimodal models, designed for a wide range of image-related tasks. UniPic offers two distinct modeling paradigms:

*   **UniPic-1.0:** A 1.5B parameter model utilizing **Unified Autoregressive Modeling** for both visual understanding and generation.
*   **UniPic-2.0 Series:** Based on **Efficient Architectures** with **Diffusion Post-Training**, offering state-of-the-art performance in text-to-image generation, image editing, and multimodal reasoning (includes *SD3.5M-Kontext* and *MetaQuery* variants).

## Key Features

*   **Text-to-Image Generation:** Transform text prompts into stunning, high-fidelity images.
*   **Image Editing:** Effortlessly perform inpainting, outpainting, and object manipulation within images.
*   **Image Understanding:** Leverage robust perception capabilities for a variety of visual tasks.
*   **Efficient Architecture:** Optimized for a balance of high accuracy and efficient deployment.
