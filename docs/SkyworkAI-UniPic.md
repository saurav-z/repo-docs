## Overview

This repository provides access to the model weights and official implementations of **UniPic**, a series of unified multimodal models developed by Skywork AI. UniPic models excel in image understanding, generation, and editing tasks by leveraging two distinct modeling approaches:

*   **UniPic-1.0:** This model utilizes a **Unified Autoregressive Modeling** approach with 1.5 billion parameters. It enables both perception and synthesis tasks using a single transformer.
*   **UniPic-2.0 Series:** These models employ **Efficient Architectures** combined with **Diffusion Post-Training**, offering superior performance in text-to-image generation, detailed image editing, and complex multimodal reasoning. Variants include *SD3.5M-Kontext* and *MetaQuery*.

## Key Features

*   **Text-to-Image Generation:** Create stunning, high-fidelity images directly from natural language prompts.
*   **Image Editing:** Perform seamless inpainting, outpainting, and object manipulation with ease.
*   **Image Understanding:** Gain robust perception capabilities for a wide array of visual tasks.
*   **Efficient Architecture:** Benefit from an architecture optimized for both accuracy and efficient deployment.
*   **Unified Approach:** Handle diverse visual tasks with a single, powerful model.
