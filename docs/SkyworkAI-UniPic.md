## Overview

Skywork UniPic is a cutting-edge AI project featuring unified multimodal models designed for comprehensive image-related tasks. This repository provides access to model weights and official implementations, offering two distinct modeling paradigms:

*   **UniPic-1.0:** A 1.5B parameter model leveraging Unified Autoregressive Modeling. This approach enables a single transformer to perform both image perception and generation seamlessly.
*   **UniPic-2.0 Series:** Built upon efficient architectures with Diffusion Post-Training, this series includes SD3.5M-Kontext and MetaQuery variants. UniPic-2.0 delivers state-of-the-art performance across various image-related applications.

## Key Features

*   **Text-to-Image Generation:** Generate high-quality images directly from natural language descriptions.
*   **Image Editing:**  Perform advanced image manipulation, including inpainting, outpainting, and object editing with ease.
*   **Image Understanding:** Achieve robust perception capabilities for various visual tasks, enhancing the model's versatility.
*   **Efficient Architecture:** Benefit from optimized architectures designed for both superior accuracy and efficient deployment.
