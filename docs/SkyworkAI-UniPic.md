## Overview

This repository provides access to the model weights and implementations for **Skywork-UniPic**, a groundbreaking series of unified multimodal models. UniPic models excel in a wide range of image-related tasks, leveraging two distinct modeling paradigms:

*   **UniPic-1.0:** This model utilizes **Unified Autoregressive Modeling** with 1.5B parameters to achieve joint visual understanding and generation. It allows a single transformer to handle both perception and synthesis tasks.
*   **UniPic-2.0 Series:** This series features efficient architectures and **Diffusion Post-Training**, including *SD3.5M-Kontext* and *MetaQuery* variants. They deliver state-of-the-art performance in:
    *   Text-to-image generation
    *   Fine-grained image editing
    *   Multimodal reasoning

## Key Features

*   **Text-to-Image Generation:** Generate high-fidelity images from descriptive natural language prompts.
*   **Image Editing:** Perform seamless inpainting, outpainting, and precise object manipulation.
*   **Image Understanding:** Robust perception capabilities for a wide range of visual tasks, enabling deep understanding of image content.
*   **Efficient Architecture:** Optimized architectures ensure high accuracy while maintaining deployability.
