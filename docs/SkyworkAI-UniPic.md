## About UniPic

The UniPic project offers a family of unified multimodal models that excel in both visual understanding and generation tasks. We provide two core modeling paradigms:

*   **UniPic-1.0:**  A 1.5B parameter model based on unified autoregressive modeling, enabling seamless integration of perception and synthesis within a single transformer.
*   **UniPic-2.0 Series:**  Leveraging efficient architectures and diffusion post-training, with variants like SD3.5M-Kontext and MetaQuery, delivering state-of-the-art performance.

## Key Features

*   **Text-to-Image Generation:** Generate high-quality images from natural language descriptions.
*   **Image Editing:** Perform seamless inpainting, outpainting, and object manipulation with precision.
*   **Image Understanding:** Achieve robust perception capabilities for diverse visual tasks.
*   **Efficient Architecture:** Benefit from optimized designs for both superior accuracy and ease of deployment.
