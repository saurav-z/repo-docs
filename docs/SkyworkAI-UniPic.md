## Key Features of UniPic

*   **Text-to-Image Generation:** Transform natural language prompts into stunning, high-fidelity images.
*   **Advanced Image Editing:** Seamlessly perform inpainting, outpainting, and precise object manipulation for effortless image refinement.
*   **Robust Image Understanding:** Leverage powerful perception capabilities for a wide range of visual tasks.
*   **Efficient Architecture:** Optimized for both exceptional performance and efficient deployment across various platforms.

## UniPic Models: A Deep Dive

Skywork UniPic offers two distinct modeling paradigms:

*   **UniPic-1.0:** A 1.5B parameter model employing Unified Autoregressive Modeling for joint visual understanding and generation, allowing a single transformer to excel at both perception and synthesis tasks.
*   **UniPic-2.0 Series:** Featuring *SD3.5M-Kontext* and *MetaQuery* variants, UniPic-2.0 leverages efficient architectures with Diffusion Post-Training to achieve state-of-the-art results in text-to-image generation, fine-grained image editing, and multimodal reasoning.
