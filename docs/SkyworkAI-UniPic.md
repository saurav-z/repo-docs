## What is Skywork UniPic?

Skywork UniPic is a cutting-edge project offering powerful multimodal AI models for a variety of image-related tasks. This repository provides access to model weights and official implementations, offering two distinct modeling paradigms designed to push the boundaries of what's possible.

## Key Features:

*   **Unified Multimodal Capabilities**:  Handles both image understanding and generation within a single model.
*   **Text-to-Image Generation**: Create stunning, high-fidelity images from natural language prompts.
*   **Image Editing**:  Perform seamless inpainting, outpainting, and advanced object manipulation.
*   **Image Understanding**: Gain robust perception capabilities for diverse visual tasks.
*   **Efficient Architecture**:  Optimized design for superior performance and efficient deployment.

## UniPic Models:

Skywork UniPic offers two main model series:

*   **UniPic-1.0**: A 1.5B parameter model utilizing **Unified Autoregressive Modeling** for joint visual understanding and generation.  This allows a single transformer to handle both perception and synthesis tasks.
*   **UniPic-2.0 Series**:  Based on **Efficient Architectures** with **Diffusion Post-Training**, the UniPic-2.0 series delivers state-of-the-art results in text-to-image generation, fine-grained image editing, and multimodal reasoning.  Variants include *SD3.5M-Kontext* and *MetaQuery*.
