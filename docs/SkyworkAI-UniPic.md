## Key Features of Skywork UniPic

Skywork UniPic offers a comprehensive suite of features for advanced image manipulation and analysis:

*   ðŸŽ¨ **Text-to-Image Generation:** Create stunning, high-fidelity images from simple text prompts.
*   ðŸ›  **Image Editing:** Effortlessly perform inpainting, outpainting, and object manipulation within images.
*   ðŸ–¼ **Image Understanding:** Leverage robust perception capabilities for a variety of visual tasks.
*   âš¡ **Efficient Architectures:** Experience optimized performance for both accuracy and efficient deployment.

## UniPic Model Overview

Skywork UniPic features two distinct modeling paradigms:

*   **UniPic-1.0:** A 1.5B parameter model utilizing Unified Autoregressive Modeling for joint visual understanding and generation. A single transformer handles both perception and synthesis tasks.
*   **UniPic-2.0 Series:** Leveraging Efficient Architectures and Diffusion Post-Training, with *SD3.5M-Kontext* and *MetaQuery* variants, delivering state-of-the-art performance in text-to-image generation, fine-grained image editing, and multimodal reasoning.
