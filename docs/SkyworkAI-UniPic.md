## Key Features of Skywork UniPic

Skywork UniPic offers a suite of powerful capabilities for diverse image-related tasks:

*   ðŸŽ¨ **Text-to-Image Generation:** Transform natural language descriptions into stunning, high-fidelity images.
*   ðŸ›  **Image Editing:**  Effortlessly perform inpainting, outpainting, and precise object manipulation.
*   ðŸ–¼ **Image Understanding:** Gain robust perception capabilities for a wide array of visual tasks.
*   âš¡ **Efficient Architecture:** Experience optimized performance for both accuracy and streamlined deployment.

## Model Overview

Skywork UniPic encompasses two distinct modeling paradigms:

*   **UniPic-1.0:** (1.5B parameters) Leverages **Unified Autoregressive Modeling** for joint visual understanding and generation. This allows a single transformer to handle both perception and synthesis tasks.
*   **UniPic-2.0 Series:** Features variants like *SD3.5M-Kontext* and *MetaQuery*, built on **Efficient Architectures** with **Diffusion Post-Training**.  This series delivers state-of-the-art results in text-to-image generation, fine-grained image editing, and multimodal reasoning.
