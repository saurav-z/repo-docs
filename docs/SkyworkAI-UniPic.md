[<img src="UniPic-2/assets/imgs/teaser.png" alt="Skywork UniPic2 Teaser" width="100%">](https://github.com/SkyworkAI/UniPic)

**Skywork UniPic empowers you to understand, generate, and edit images with cutting-edge multimodal AI.**

## Overview

This repository provides access to **Skywork-UniPic**, a suite of unified multimodal models designed for advanced image processing. Developed by SkyworkAI, UniPic offers state-of-the-art capabilities in image understanding, generation, and editing. The models utilize two distinct modeling paradigms:

*   **UniPic-1.0**: A 1.5B parameter model employing **Unified Autoregressive Modeling** for combined visual understanding and generation. This allows a single transformer to handle both perception and synthesis tasks.
*   **UniPic-2.0 Series**: Leveraging **Efficient Architectures** with **Diffusion Post-Training**, this series includes *SD3.5M-Kontext* and *MetaQuery* variants. These models achieve exceptional performance in text-to-image generation, fine-grained image editing, and complex multimodal reasoning.
