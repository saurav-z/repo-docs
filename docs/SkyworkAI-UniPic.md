## Overview

Welcome to the Skywork-UniPic repository!  This repository provides access to model weights and official implementations of unified multimodal models, designed for cutting-edge image AI. UniPic offers two distinct modeling paradigms:

*   **UniPic-1.0:** A 1.5B parameter model employing **Unified Autoregressive Modeling** for a single transformer that handles both perception and synthesis tasks.
*   **UniPic-2.0 Series:** Utilizing **Efficient Architectures** with **Diffusion Post-Training**, these variants (including *SD3.5M-Kontext* and *MetaQuery*) excel in text-to-image generation, fine-grained image editing, and multimodal reasoning.

## Key Features of UniPic

*   **Text-to-Image Generation:** Create high-fidelity images from natural language descriptions.
*   **Image Editing:** Perform seamless inpainting, outpainting, and object manipulation.
*   **Image Understanding:** Achieve robust perception capabilities for various visual tasks.
*   **Efficient Architecture:** Experience optimized performance, balanced for accuracy and deployability.
