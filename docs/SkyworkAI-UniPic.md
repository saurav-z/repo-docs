## üöÄ Key Features

UniPic offers a suite of powerful features, all within a unified multimodal framework:

*   üé® **Text-to-Image Generation:** Transform natural language prompts into stunning, high-fidelity images.
*   üõ† **Advanced Image Editing:** Effortlessly perform inpainting, outpainting, and object manipulation for unparalleled creative control.
*   üñº **Robust Image Understanding:** Gain deep insights into visual content with exceptional perception capabilities.
*   ‚ö° **Efficient Architecture:** Benefit from optimized architectures that deliver impressive performance and are designed for practical deployment.

## üí° Models Overview

UniPic leverages two innovative modeling paradigms to achieve its remarkable capabilities:

*   **UniPic-1.0:** A unified autoregressive model (1.5B parameters) designed for joint visual understanding and generation.  This model utilizes a single transformer architecture to effectively handle both perception and synthesis tasks.
*   **UniPic-2.0 Series:** This series introduces efficient architectures combined with diffusion-based post-training, including the *SD3.5M-Kontext* and *MetaQuery* variants.  UniPic-2.0 delivers state-of-the-art performance in text-to-image generation, fine-grained image editing, and multimodal reasoning tasks.
