## What is Skywork UniPic?

Skywork UniPic represents a significant leap in artificial intelligence, offering a unified approach to image understanding, generation, and editing. This repository provides the model weights and official implementations for two distinct modeling paradigms designed to revolutionize how we interact with visual content.

## Key Features:

*   **Text-to-Image Generation:** Effortlessly create high-quality images from natural language descriptions, bringing your ideas to life.
*   **Image Editing:** Experience seamless inpainting, outpainting, and object manipulation for precise and creative control.
*   **Image Understanding:** Leverage robust perception capabilities for a wide range of visual tasks, enhancing context awareness.
*   **Efficient Architecture:** Benefit from models optimized for both superior accuracy and efficient deployment, opening the door for real-world applications.
*   **Unified Autoregressive Modeling (UniPic-1.0):** A 1.5B parameter model enabling joint visual understanding and generation with a single transformer.
*   **Efficient Architectures with Diffusion Post-Training (UniPic-2.0):** State-of-the-art performance in text-to-image generation, image editing, and multimodal reasoning with SD3.5M-Kontext and MetaQuery variants.
