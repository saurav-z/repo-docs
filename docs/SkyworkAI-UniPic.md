## Key Features

*   **Text-to-Image Generation:** Transform textual descriptions into stunning, high-quality images with remarkable fidelity.
*   **Image Editing:** Effortlessly modify existing images with seamless inpainting, outpainting, and precise object manipulation.
*   **Image Understanding:** Leverage robust perception capabilities for a wide range of visual tasks, enhancing your ability to analyze and interpret image content.
*   **Efficient Architecture:** Experience optimized performance with efficient model architectures designed for both accuracy and deployment readiness.
*   **Unified Multimodal Capabilities:** Benefit from models that seamlessly integrate image understanding, generation, and editing within a single, cohesive framework.

## Overview

This repository provides access to the model weights and official implementations of Skywork's UniPic unified multimodal models, which utilize two distinct modeling paradigms:

*   **UniPic-1.0:** A 1.5B parameter model leveraging **Unified Autoregressive Modeling** for joint visual understanding and generation. It employs a single transformer architecture to handle both perception and synthesis tasks.
*   **UniPic-2.0 Series:** This series features *SD3.5M-Kontext* and *MetaQuery* variants built on **Efficient Architectures** with **Diffusion Post-Training**, achieving state-of-the-art performance in text-to-image generation, fine-grained image editing, and advanced multimodal reasoning.
