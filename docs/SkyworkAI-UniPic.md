## About Skywork UniPic

Skywork UniPic is a suite of advanced AI models designed to revolutionize how we interact with images. This repository provides access to model weights and official implementations, enabling you to explore the cutting edge of multimodal AI. UniPic offers two distinct modeling paradigms:

*   **UniPic-1.0:** Leverages Unified Autoregressive Modeling (1.5B parameters) for both visual understanding and generation.
*   **UniPic-2.0 Series:** Employs Efficient Architectures with Diffusion Post-Training, including SD3.5M-Kontext and MetaQuery variants, for state-of-the-art performance.

## Key Features

*   **Text-to-Image Generation:** Generate stunning, high-fidelity images from natural language descriptions.
*   **Image Editing:** Effortlessly perform inpainting, outpainting, and object manipulation within images.
*   **Image Understanding:** Achieve robust perception capabilities for a wide range of visual tasks.
*   **Efficient Architecture:** Benefit from optimized models designed for both high accuracy and efficient deployment.
