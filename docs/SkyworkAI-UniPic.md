## ðŸš€ Overview: Unleashing the Power of Unified Multimodal AI

Welcome to the **Skywork-UniPic** repository! This project provides the model weights and official implementations of our unified multimodal models, designed for comprehensive image-related tasks. UniPic employs two innovative modeling paradigms:

*   **UniPic-1.0**: This model leverages *1.5B parameters* and utilizes **Unified Autoregressive Modeling** for joint visual understanding and generation, allowing a single transformer to excel in both perception and synthesis.
*   **UniPic-2.0 Series**: Featuring *SD3.5M-Kontext* and *MetaQuery* variants, UniPic-2.0 is built on **Efficient Architectures** enhanced with **Diffusion Post-Training**. This series sets new benchmarks in text-to-image generation, precise image editing, and advanced multimodal reasoning.

## âœ¨ Key Features of UniPic

*   **Text-to-Image Generation:** Generate high-quality images from natural language descriptions.
*   **Image Editing:** Perform seamless inpainting, outpainting, and precise object manipulation within images.
*   **Image Understanding:** Benefit from robust perception capabilities, enabling UniPic to excel in diverse visual tasks.
*   **Efficient Architecture:** Experience optimized performance and ease of deployment, thanks to our carefully designed architecture.
