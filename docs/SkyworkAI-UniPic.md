## What is Skywork UniPic?

Skywork UniPic is a cutting-edge project featuring unified multimodal models designed to excel in image-related tasks. This repository provides model weights and implementations for two powerful modeling paradigms.

### **Key Highlights**

*   **UniPic-1.0:** This version leverages a 1.5B parameter model using **Unified Autoregressive Modeling**, allowing a single transformer to handle both visual understanding and generation.
*   **UniPic-2.0 Series:** Features Efficient Architectures enhanced by Diffusion Post-Training, this series delivers state-of-the-art performance in text-to-image generation, image editing, and multimodal reasoning. Variants include SD3.5M-Kontext and MetaQuery.

## Key Features of UniPic

*   **Text-to-Image Generation:** Create stunning images from detailed textual descriptions.
*   **Image Editing:** Perform advanced image manipulations such as inpainting, outpainting, and object alteration.
*   **Image Understanding:** Demonstrate robust perception capabilities across a variety of visual tasks.
*   **Efficient Architecture:** Experience optimized performance and enhanced deployability.
