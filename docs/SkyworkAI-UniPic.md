## Key Features of UniPic

*   **Text-to-Image Generation:** Transform natural language prompts into stunning, high-fidelity images.
*   **Image Editing:** Seamlessly inpaint, outpaint, and manipulate objects within your images.
*   **Image Understanding:**  Gain robust perception capabilities for diverse visual tasks.
*   **Efficient Architectures:** Experience optimized performance and deployability.
*   **Unified Modeling:** Benefit from a single transformer capable of handling both perception and synthesis.

## UniPic Models: Unleashing the Power of Unified AI

UniPic offers two powerful modeling paradigms:

*   **UniPic-1.0:**  This model employs Unified Autoregressive Modeling with 1.5B parameters, enabling joint visual understanding and generation.
*   **UniPic-2.0 Series:** Leveraging efficient architectures and diffusion-based post-training, UniPic-2.0 delivers exceptional performance in text-to-image generation, fine-grained image editing, and multimodal reasoning. This series includes the *SD3.5M-Kontext* and *MetaQuery* variants.
