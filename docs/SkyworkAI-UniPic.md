## Overview

Skywork UniPic offers a suite of unified multimodal models designed to revolutionize how you interact with images. This repository provides model weights and official implementations, featuring two distinct modeling paradigms:

*   **UniPic-1.0:** A 1.5B parameter model utilizing **Unified Autoregressive Modeling** for joint visual understanding and generation. It employs a single transformer to handle both perception and synthesis tasks.
*   **UniPic-2.0 Series:** Based on **Efficient Architectures** with **Diffusion Post-Training**, the UniPic-2.0 series delivers state-of-the-art performance with variants like *SD3.5M-Kontext* and *MetaQuery*, excelling in text-to-image generation, fine-grained image editing, and multimodal reasoning.

## Key Features

*   **Text-to-Image Generation:** Effortlessly create stunning images from your natural language prompts.
*   **Image Editing:** Seamlessly perform inpainting, outpainting, and precise object manipulation.
*   **Image Understanding:** Robust perception capabilities enabling advanced visual analysis and understanding.
*   **Efficient Architecture:** Optimized for both exceptional accuracy and efficient deployment across various platforms.
