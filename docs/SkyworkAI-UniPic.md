## Overview

This repository provides the model weights and official implementations for **Skywork UniPic**, a cutting-edge suite of unified multimodal models designed for a wide range of visual tasks. UniPic employs two distinct modeling paradigms to achieve state-of-the-art performance:

*   **UniPic-1.0:** Leverages **Unified Autoregressive Modeling** with 1.5B parameters, enabling joint visual understanding and generation within a single transformer.
*   **UniPic-2.0 Series:** Features **Efficient Architectures** enhanced with **Diffusion Post-Training**, including *SD3.5M-Kontext* and *MetaQuery* variants, delivering exceptional results in text-to-image generation, fine-grained image editing, and multimodal reasoning.

## Key Features

*   **Text-to-Image Generation:** Create stunning, high-fidelity images from natural language prompts.
*   **Image Editing:** Seamlessly perform inpainting, outpainting, and object manipulation for creative control.
*   **Image Understanding:** Benefit from robust perception capabilities for a variety of visual tasks.
*   **Efficient Architecture:** Optimized for both accuracy and ease of deployment.
