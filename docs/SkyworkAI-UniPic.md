## Key Highlights of UniPic

UniPic offers a powerful suite of features, revolutionizing how we interact with images:

*   **Text-to-Image Generation:** Transform natural language prompts into stunning, high-fidelity images.
*   **Advanced Image Editing:** Seamlessly perform inpainting, outpainting, and precise object manipulation.
*   **Robust Image Understanding:** Benefit from strong perception capabilities for diverse visual tasks.
*   **Efficient Architecture:** Experience optimal performance and enhanced deployability thanks to our optimized architecture.
*   **Unified Modeling:** Leverages a single transformer model, streamlining both perception and synthesis tasks (UniPic-1).
*   **Diffusion Post-Training (UniPic-2):** Achieve state-of-the-art results with efficient architectures and Diffusion Post-Training

## Model Versions

*   **UniPic-1.0:** A 1.5B parameter model leveraging unified autoregressive modeling.
*   **UniPic-2.0 Series:** Explore the SD3.5M-Kontext and MetaQuery variants, built on efficient architectures with diffusion post-training.
