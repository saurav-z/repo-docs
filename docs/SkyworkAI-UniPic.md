## Key Features & Capabilities

UniPic offers a comprehensive suite of features, enabling powerful and versatile image-based applications:

*   ðŸŽ¨ **Text-to-Image Generation:** Create stunning images from simple text descriptions with high fidelity.
*   ðŸ›  **Image Editing:** Effortlessly perform inpainting, outpainting, and object manipulation for precise image control.
*   ðŸ–¼ **Image Understanding:** Gain robust perception capabilities to handle a variety of visual tasks.
*   âš¡ **Efficient Architecture:** Benefit from optimized architectures designed for both exceptional accuracy and efficient deployment.

## Model Overview

Skywork UniPic encompasses two distinct modeling paradigms:

*   **UniPic-1.0:** A 1.5B parameter model utilizing **Unified Autoregressive Modeling** for joint visual understanding and generation, consolidating perception and synthesis within a single transformer.
*   **UniPic-2.0 Series:** Featuring *SD3.5M-Kontext* and *MetaQuery* variants, built upon **Efficient Architectures** and leveraging **Diffusion Post-Training** to achieve state-of-the-art performance in text-to-image generation, fine-grained image editing, and multimodal reasoning.
