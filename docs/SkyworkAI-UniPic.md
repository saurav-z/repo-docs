## Overview

This repository provides the model weights and official implementations for Skywork UniPic, a cutting-edge unified multimodal AI system. UniPic offers two powerful modeling paradigms:

*   **UniPic-1.0:** A 1.5B parameter model based on Unified Autoregressive Modeling, excelling in joint visual understanding and generation.
*   **UniPic-2.0 Series:** Featuring efficient architectures with Diffusion Post-Training, delivering state-of-the-art results in text-to-image generation, image editing, and multimodal reasoning.

## Key Features

*   ðŸŽ¨ **Text-to-Image Generation:** Generate high-quality images from natural language descriptions.
*   ðŸ›  **Image Editing:** Perform seamless inpainting, outpainting, and object manipulation.
*   ðŸ–¼ **Image Understanding:** Gain robust perception capabilities for various visual tasks.
*   âš¡ **Efficient Architecture:** Benefit from optimized architectures designed for both accuracy and efficient deployment.
