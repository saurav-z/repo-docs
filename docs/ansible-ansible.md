*   **Configuration Management:** Automate the configuration of systems, ensuring consistency and reducing manual errors.
*   **Application Deployment:** Streamline application deployments across your infrastructure, supporting zero-downtime rolling updates.
*   **Orchestration:** Orchestrate complex multi-tier deployments and workflows.
*   **Cloud Provisioning:** Easily provision resources on various cloud platforms.
*   **Ad-Hoc Task Execution:** Run quick commands and scripts across your infrastructure.
*   **Network Automation:** Automate the configuration and management of network devices.
*   **Human-Readable Automation:** Define infrastructure as code using YAML, making automation scripts easy to understand and maintain.
*   **Parallel Execution:** Manage machines quickly and in parallel for faster automation.
*   **Security Focused:** Designed with security in mind, with features like easy auditability and review of automation content.
*   **Modular Design:** Module development is possible in any dynamic language, not just Python.
