## Getting Started with Ansible

### Installation

Ansible is easy to install.  You can install it using `pip` or your system's package manager.  For detailed installation instructions, please refer to the [Ansible installation guide](https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/latest/installation_guide/intro_installation.html).

### Development Branch

Power users and developers can run the `devel` branch, which has the latest features and fixes. Although it is reasonably stable, you are more likely to encounter breaking changes when running the `devel` branch. We recommend getting involved in the Ansible community if you want to run the `devel` branch.
