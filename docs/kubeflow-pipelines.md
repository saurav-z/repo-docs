# Kubeflow Pipelines: Orchestrate and Automate Your Machine Learning Workflows

**Kubeflow Pipelines empowers you to build, deploy, and manage end-to-end machine learning workflows on Kubernetes, streamlining your MLOps processes.** Explore the original repository [here](https://github.com/kubeflow/pipelines).

## Key Features of Kubeflow Pipelines

*   **End-to-End Orchestration:** Simplify the creation and management of complex ML pipelines.
*   **Experimentation:** Easily explore different ideas and techniques, and manage your experiments effectively.
*   **Component and Pipeline Reusability:** Build upon existing components and pipelines for rapid solution development.
*   **Container Runtime Agnostic**: Able to run on Kubernetes clusters with any Container runtimes, like containerd, CRI-O.
*   **Integration with Kubeflow:** Seamlessly integrates with the Kubeflow platform for a unified ML environment.

## Installation

*   Install Kubeflow Pipelines as part of the [Kubeflow Platform](https://www.kubeflow.org/docs/started/installing-kubeflow/#kubeflow-platform).
*   Alternatively, deploy Kubeflow Pipelines as a [standalone service](https://www.kubeflow.org/docs/components/pipelines/operator-guides/installation/).

## Documentation & Resources

*   **Overview:** Get started with your first pipeline and learn more in the [Kubeflow Pipelines overview](https://www.kubeflow.org/docs/components/pipelines/overview/).
