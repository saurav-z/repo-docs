## About BookWyrm

BookWyrm is designed to be a social platform for readers, allowing users to track their reading, review books, and connect with others. It leverages the power of ActivityPub to offer a federated experience.  This allows for the creation of small, independent communities where users can build and manage their own spaces.

## Federation & ActivityPub

BookWyrm is built on the ActivityPub protocol, which allows it to interoperate with other ActivityPub services like Mastodon and Pleroma.  This enables:

*   **Cross-Platform Interaction:** Users can engage with each other regardless of the instance or platform they use.
*   **Decentralized Data:**  Metadata about books and authors is shared across the network, contributing to a collaborative, decentralized book database.
