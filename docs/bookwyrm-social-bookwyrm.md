BookWyrm empowers you to engage in meaningful discussions about books, share your reading experiences, and explore a vibrant community of readers. Unlike centralized platforms, BookWyrm offers a federated experience, allowing you to connect with users on other ActivityPub-compatible services like Mastodon and Pleroma. This enables you to create and join small, trusted communities centered around shared interests.

## Key Features:

*   **Social Reading:** Share your thoughts on books by writing reviews, posting quotes, and commenting on what you and others are reading.
*   **Reading Activity Tracking:** Easily keep track of the books you've read, are currently reading, and want to read in the future.
*   **Federation with ActivityPub:** Interact with users on other BookWyrm instances and compatible services like Mastodon, fostering a decentralized network. This also supports a collaborative, decentralized book database.
*   **Privacy and Moderation:** Control who can see your posts and manage the instances you choose to federate with, providing a safe and customizable experience.
*   **Discover New Reads:** Explore books and authors, and discover recommendations from friends and communities.

## Key Benefits:

*   **Community-Focused:** Join or create book clubs and communities based on your interests.
*   **Decentralized:** Avoid being locked into a single platform and have control over your data.
*   **Interoperable:** Connect with readers across the Fediverse, expanding your social reach.
*   **User-Friendly:** Easily track your reading, share your reviews, and engage with others.
