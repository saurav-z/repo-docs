## Key Features

*   **Social Reading:** Share reviews, quotes, and reading progress with friends and the BookWyrm community.
*   **Track Your Reading:**  Maintain a personal reading log to track books you've read, are reading, and want to read.
*   **Federation with ActivityPub:**  Connect with users on other BookWyrm instances and ActivityPub platforms like Mastodon and Pleroma.  This fosters a decentralized network and a shared book metadata database.
*   **Privacy and Moderation:** Control your posts' visibility and manage federation settings for a safe and personalized experience.
