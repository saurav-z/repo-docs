## About BookWyrm

BookWyrm is a social platform designed to foster a vibrant community around books. It focuses on social interaction and discussion rather than solely cataloging books. Utilizing ActivityPub, BookWyrm facilitates a decentralized network, enabling users to connect across various instances and with other ActivityPub services. This allows for greater control over your online experience and promotes smaller, more focused communities.

## Federation Explained

BookWyrm's foundation in ActivityPub allows for interoperability with other platforms, such as Mastodon. This means that users on different BookWyrm instances or other ActivityPub services can interact with each other, share content, and build a shared, decentralized database of book information. Federation empowers users to create and manage their own communities, choosing who to connect with and how to moderate their space.

## Technology Stack

*   **Backend:** Django, PostgreSQL, ActivityPub, Celery, Redis
*   **Frontend:** Django templates, Bulma.io, Vanilla JavaScript
*   **Deployment:** Docker, Gunicorn, Flower, Nginx
