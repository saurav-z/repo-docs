## About BookWyrm

BookWyrm is a social reading platform built on the ActivityPub protocol, promoting a decentralized and community-driven approach to social networking. Unlike centralized platforms, BookWyrm emphasizes small, self-governing communities where users have more control over their experience.

## Federation with ActivityPub

BookWyrm utilizes ActivityPub, allowing seamless interaction between different BookWyrm instances and other ActivityPub-compliant services such as Mastodon. This means you can connect with friends regardless of their preferred platform, share reviews, and build a collaborative, decentralized book database.  Learn more about BookWyrm's federation implementation in `FEDERATION.md`.
