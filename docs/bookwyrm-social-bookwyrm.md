BookWyrm is a social platform built on ActivityPub, enabling users to join communities, track their reading habits, discuss books, and discover new titles.  Federation allows instances to connect with each other and other ActivityPub services such as Mastodon and Pleroma.

**Key Features:**

*   **Social Reading:** Share reviews, quotes, and discuss books with fellow readers.
*   **Reading Tracking:** Maintain a personal reading log, track what you're currently reading, and create a to-read list.
*   **Decentralized Network:** Interact with users on other BookWyrm instances and ActivityPub-compatible platforms like Mastodon and Pleroma.
*   **Community-Focused:**  Join or create your own book-loving community with control over federation and moderation.
*   **Privacy & Control:** Manage your privacy settings and control your instance's federation.

**Why Choose BookWyrm?**

*   **Connect with Like-Minded Readers:**  Join communities and connect with book lovers.
*   **Own Your Data:**  Enjoy a decentralized platform, unlike centralized social media.
