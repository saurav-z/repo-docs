## Why Choose BookWyrm?

BookWyrm offers a refreshing alternative to centralized book-focused social networks, emphasizing community-driven content and user autonomy.  Build your own book club, join a specific interest group, or connect with friends â€“ all within a network that prioritizes your control.

## Federation Explained

BookWyrm leverages ActivityPub, a decentralized social networking protocol, to connect with other instances. This federation allows you to:

*   Follow and interact with users on different BookWyrm instances and other ActivityPub platforms.
*   Share book reviews and discussions across the network.
*   Contribute to a collectively built database of books and authors.
*   Join and foster small, self-determining communities.
