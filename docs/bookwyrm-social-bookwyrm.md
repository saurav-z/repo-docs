## Key Features

*   **Social Reading:** Share your reading journey by posting reviews, comments, and quotes.
*   **Reading Tracking:** Keep a record of books you've read, are currently reading, and want to read.
*   **Federation with ActivityPub:** Interact with users on other BookWyrm instances and ActivityPub-compatible platforms like Mastodon. This fosters a decentralized network where you can connect with readers across the web.
*   **Privacy and Moderation:** Control your posts' visibility and manage your instance's federation settings.
*   **Discover New Books:** Explore recommendations and discussions to find your next favorite read.

## Why Choose BookWyrm?

Unlike centralized platforms, BookWyrm allows you to create or join a community that aligns with your interests, giving you greater control over your social reading experience. Federation connects you with a wider network while maintaining a focus on smaller, trusted communities.
