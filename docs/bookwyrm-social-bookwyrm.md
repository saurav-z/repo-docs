BookWyrm empowers you to build your online reading community, free from the constraints of centralized platforms. Connect with friends, discover new books, and engage in thoughtful discussions.

## Key Features:

*   **Social Reading:** Share reviews, quotes, and thoughts on books you're reading.
*   **Reading Activity Tracking:** Maintain a personal record of books you've read and want to read.
*   **Federation (ActivityPub):** Interact with users on other BookWyrm instances and compatible platforms like Mastodon and Pleroma. This also helps build a decentralized database of books and authors.
*   **Privacy & Moderation:** Control your content and who you interact with.  Configure instance federation to build a safe community.
