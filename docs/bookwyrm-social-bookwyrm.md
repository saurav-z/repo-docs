## About BookWyrm

BookWyrm is built on the ActivityPub protocol, allowing users to connect with other instances of BookWyrm and other compatible platforms, such as Mastodon and Pleroma. This fosters a decentralized network of communities where users can engage in thoughtful discussions and share their passion for reading. BookWyrm is designed for social reading, offering features to track your reading, review books, and follow friends, while also contributing to a collaborative, decentralized database of books and authors.

## Federation Explained

BookWyrm uses ActivityPub to connect different instances and other services. This means you can follow friends on other servers and they can engage with your content. It facilitates independent communities with the ability to choose their own moderation and community standards, in contrast to larger, centralized platforms.
