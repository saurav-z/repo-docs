BookWyrm is a social network designed for readers to track their reading, write reviews, discover new books, and connect with a community of book lovers. Built on ActivityPub, BookWyrm embraces federation, allowing users to participate in small, independent communities that connect with each other and other ActivityPub services like Mastodon and Pleroma.
