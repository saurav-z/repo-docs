MetricFlow is a semantic layer that simplifies defining and managing metrics. It compiles metric definitions into clear, reusable SQL, ensuring consistent and accurate results when analyzing data by relevant attributes (dimensions).

The name “MetricFlow” reflects its approach: metric requests are compiled into a dataflow-based query plan, which is then optimized and translated into engine-specific SQL.

## Key Features

*   **Metric Definition in Code:** Define metrics in a structured, version-controlled manner.
*   **Complex Metric Types:** Supports ratio, expression, cumulative metrics and more.
*   **Multi-Hop Joins:** Handles complex relationships between fact and dimension tables.
*   **Time Granularity Aggregation:**  Aggregate metrics across different time granularities.
*   **SQL Compilation and Optimization:**  Compiles metric definitions into optimized, engine-specific SQL.

## Getting Started

### Installation

Install MetricFlow from PyPI:

```bash
pip install dbt-metricflow
```

MetricFlow works with a dbt project and a dbt adapter. The `dbt-metricflow` bundle is provided for this purpose.

You may need to install Postgres or Graphviz. You can do so by following the install instructions for [Postgres](https://www.postgresql.org/download/) or [Graphviz](https://www.graphviz.org/download/). Mac users may prefer to use brew: `brew install postgresql` or `brew install graphviz`.

### Tutorial

Run the tutorial within your dbt project root directory:

```bash
mf tutorial
```
