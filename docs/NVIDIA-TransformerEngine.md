## Quickstart

To get started quickly, take a look at the `Quickstart Notebook <https://github.com/NVIDIA/TransformerEngine/blob/main/docs/examples/quickstart.ipynb>`_.

## Examples

### PyTorch

```python
import torch
import transformer_engine.pytorch as te
from transformer_engine.common import recipe

# Set dimensions.
in_features = 768
out_features = 3072
hidden_size = 2048

# Initialize model and inputs.
model = te.Linear(in_features, out_features, bias=True)
inp = torch.randn(hidden_size, in_features, device="cuda")

# Create an FP8 recipe. Note: All input args are optional.
fp8_recipe = recipe.DelayedScaling(margin=0, fp8_format=recipe.Format.E4M3)

# Enable autocasting for the forward pass
with te.fp8_autocast(enabled=True, fp8_recipe=fp8_recipe):
    out = model(inp)

loss = out.sum()
loss.backward()
```

### JAX

#### Flax

```python
import flax
import jax
import jax.numpy as jnp
import transformer_engine.jax as te
import transformer_engine.jax.flax as te_flax
from transformer_engine.common import recipe

BATCH = 32
SEQLEN = 128
HIDDEN = 1024

# Initialize RNG and inputs.
rng = jax.random.PRNGKey(0)
init_rng, data_rng = jax.random.split(rng)
inp = jax.random.normal(data_rng, [BATCH, SEQLEN, HIDDEN], jnp.float32)

# Create an FP8 recipe. Note: All input args are optional.
fp8_recipe = recipe.DelayedScaling(margin=0, fp8_format=recipe.Format.HYBRID)

# Enable autocasting for the forward pass
with te.fp8_autocast(enabled=True, fp8_recipe=fp8_recipe):
    model = te_flax.DenseGeneral(features=HIDDEN)

    def loss_fn(params, other_vars, inp):
      out = model.apply({'params':params, **other_vars}, inp)
      return jnp.mean(out)

    # Initialize models.
    variables = model.init(init_rng, inp)
    other_variables, params = flax.core.pop(variables, 'params')

    # Construct the forward and backward function
    fwd_bwd_fn = jax.value_and_grad(loss_fn, argnums=(0, 1))

    for _ in range(10):
      loss, (param_grads, other_grads) = fwd_bwd_fn(params, other_variables, inp)
```

## Installation

### System Requirements

*   **Hardware:** Blackwell, Hopper, Grace Hopper/Blackwell, Ada, Ampere
*   **OS:** Linux (official), WSL2 (limited support)
*   **Software:**
    *   CUDA: 12.1+ (Hopper/Ada/Ampere), 12.8+ (Blackwell) with compatible NVIDIA drivers
    *   cuDNN: 9.3+
    *   Compiler: GCC 9+ or Clang 10+ with C++17 support
    *   Python: 3.12 recommended
*   **Source Build Requirements:** CMake 3.18+, Ninja, Git 2.17+, pybind11 2.6.0+
*   **Notes:** FP8 features require Compute Capability 8.9+ (Ada/Hopper/Blackwell)

### Installation Methods

#### Docker (Recommended)

The easiest way to get started is using Docker images from the [NVIDIA GPU Cloud (NGC) Catalog](https://catalog.ngc.nvidia.com/orgs/nvidia/containers/pytorch).

For example, to run the NGC PyTorch container interactively:

```bash
docker run --gpus all -it --rm nvcr.io/nvidia/pytorch:25.04-py3
```

Where `25.04` (corresponding to April 2025 release) is the container version.

**Benefits of using NGC containers:**

*   Pre-installed dependencies with optimized configurations
*   NGC PyTorch 23.08+ containers include FlashAttention-2

#### pip Installation

**Prerequisites for pip installation:**

*   Compatible C++ compiler
*   CUDA Toolkit with cuDNN and NVCC (NVIDIA CUDA Compiler)

To install the latest stable version using pip:

```bash
# For PyTorch integration
pip install --no-build-isolation transformer_engine[pytorch]

# For JAX integration
pip install --no-build-isolation transformer_engine[jax]

# For both frameworks
pip install --no-build-isolation transformer_engine[pytorch,jax]
```

Alternatively, install directly from the GitHub repository:

```bash
pip install --no-build-isolation git+https://github.com/NVIDIA/TransformerEngine.git@stable
```

Specify frameworks during GitHub installation using the environment variable:

```bash
NVTE_FRAMEWORK=pytorch,jax pip install --no-build-isolation git+https://github.com/NVIDIA/TransformerEngine.git@stable
```

#### conda Installation

To install the latest stable version with conda from conda-forge:

```bash
# For PyTorch integration
conda install -c conda-forge transformer-engine-torch

# JAX integration (coming soon)
```

#### Source Installation

See the detailed [installation guide](https://docs.nvidia.com/deeplearning/transformer-engine/user-guide/installation.html#installation-from-source).

### Environment Variables

Customize the build process by setting these environment variables:

*   **CUDA_PATH**: Path to CUDA installation
*   **CUDNN_PATH**: Path to cuDNN installation
*   **CXX**: Path to C++ compiler
*   **NVTE_FRAMEWORK**: Comma-separated list of frameworks (e.g., `pytorch,jax`)
*   **MAX_JOBS**: Limit parallel build jobs (default varies)
*   **NVTE_BUILD_THREADS_PER_JOB**: Control threads per build job

### Compiling with FlashAttention

Transformer Engine supports FlashAttention-2 and FlashAttention-3 in PyTorch for improved performance. FlashAttention-3 was added in release v1.11 and is prioritized over FlashAttention-2 when both are present in the environment.

Verify the FlashAttention version being used by setting these environment variables:

```bash
NVTE_DEBUG=1 NVTE_DEBUG_LEVEL=1 python your_script.py
```

**Note:** FlashAttention-2 compilation can be resource-intensive and may require setting `MAX_JOBS=1` to avoid out-of-memory errors.

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues and Solutions:

1.  **ABI Compatibility Issues:**
    *   **Symptoms:** `ImportError` with undefined symbols.
    *   **Solution:** Ensure PyTorch and Transformer Engine are built with the same C++ ABI settings. Rebuild PyTorch from source if needed.
2.  **Missing Headers or Libraries:**
    *   **Symptoms:** CMake errors about missing headers (e.g., `cudnn.h`, `cublas_v2.h`).
    *   **Solution:** Install missing development packages or set environment variables (e.g., `CUDA_PATH`, `CUDNN_PATH`).
3.  **Build Resource Issues:**
    *   **Symptoms:** Compilation hangs, system freezes, or out-of-memory errors.
    *   **Solution:** Limit parallel builds with `MAX_JOBS=1` and `NVTE_BUILD_THREADS_PER_JOB=1`.
4.  **Verbose Build Logging:**
    *   **Solution:** For detailed build logs, use `pip install -v -v -v --no-build-isolation .` in the `transformer_engine` directory.

## Breaking Changes

### v1.7: Padding mask definition for PyTorch

The padding mask definition in PyTorch changed from `True` meaning inclusion to `True` meaning exclusion of the corresponding position in attention, to unify with the other frameworks.

## FP8 Convergence

FP8 has been extensively tested, with **no significant difference** in loss curves compared to BF16 training.  Accuracy has also been validated on downstream LLM tasks.
