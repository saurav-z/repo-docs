## Getting Started

Integrate this powerful security tool into your workflow effortlessly with the following steps:

1.  **Add to your `.github/workflows/security.yml`:**

    ```yaml
    name: Security Review

    permissions:
      pull-requests: write  # Needed for leaving PR comments
      contents: read

    on:
      pull_request:

    jobs:
      security:
        runs-on: ubuntu-latest
        steps:
          - uses: actions/checkout@v4
            with:
              ref: ${{ github.event.pull_request.head.sha || github.sha }}
              fetch-depth: 2
          
          - uses: anthropics/claude-code-security-review@main
            with:
              comment-pr: true
              claude-api-key: ${{ secrets.CLAUDE_API_KEY }}
    ```

2.  **Configure API Key:**  Provide your Anthropic Claude API key as a GitHub secret (`CLAUDE_API_KEY`).  Ensure your key is enabled for both the Claude API and Claude Code.

## Configuration Options

Customize the action's behavior to fit your specific needs:

## How It Works

1.  **PR Analysis:**  The action analyzes the pull request's diff.
2.  **Contextual Review:** Claude examines code changes within their context.
3.  **Finding Generation:** Security issues are identified with detailed explanations, severity ratings, and remediation advice.
4.  **False Positive Filtering:**  Advanced filtering reduces noise by removing low-impact issues.
5.  **PR Comments:**  Findings are posted as comments directly in the pull request.

## Security Analysis Capabilities

*   **Injection Attacks:** SQL, command, LDAP, XPath, NoSQL, XXE, and more.
*   **Authentication & Authorization:** Broken auth, privilege escalation, insecure object references, and session flaws.
*   **Data Exposure:** Hardcoded secrets, sensitive data logging, information disclosure, and PII handling.
*   **Cryptographic Issues:** Weak algorithms, improper key management, and insecure random number generation.
*   **Input Validation:** Missing validation, improper sanitization, and buffer overflows.
*   **Business Logic Flaws:** Race conditions and TOCTOU issues.
*   **Configuration Security:** Insecure defaults, missing security headers, and permissive CORS.
*   **Supply Chain:** Vulnerable dependencies and typosquatting risks.
*   **Code Execution:** RCE via deserialization, pickle injection, and eval injection.
*   **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** Reflected, stored, and DOM-based XSS.

### False Positive Filtering

The tool intelligently filters out common false positives:

*   Denial of Service vulnerabilities
*   Rate limiting concerns
*   Memory/CPU exhaustion issues
*   Generic input validation without impact
*   Open redirect vulnerabilities

Customize this further to align with your security objectives.

### Benefits Over Traditional SAST

*   **Contextual Understanding:** Analyzes code meaning, not just patterns.
*   **Reduced False Positives:** AI-powered analysis minimizes noise.
*   **Detailed Explanations:** Clear explanations of vulnerabilities and solutions.
*   **Customizable:** Adaptable to specific security needs.

## Integration: /security-review Command

Use the `/security-review` [slash command](https://docs.anthropic.com/en/docs/claude-code/slash-commands) within your Claude Code environment to perform security analysis on your code with a single command.

### Customizing the Command

1.  Copy `security-review.md` from the repository's `.claude/commands/` folder to your project's `.claude/commands/` folder.
2.  Edit `security-review.md` to adjust the security analysis instructions for your needs.

## Advanced Configuration

Configure custom scanning and false positive filtering through your settings. See the [`docs/`](docs/) folder for more details.

## Testing

Ensure proper functionality with the test suite:

```bash
cd claude-code-security-review
pytest claudecode -v
```
