## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

*   A supported version of Python installed.

### Installation

1.  **Create a virtual environment (recommended):**

    ```bash
    python -m venv .venv
    . .venv/bin/activate  # (or equivalent activation command for your shell)
    ```

2.  **Install Boto3 using pip:**

    ```bash
    python -m pip install boto3
    ```

### Configuration

1.  **Set up AWS credentials:** Configure your AWS credentials using one of the methods described in the [Boto3 documentation](https://boto3.amazonaws.com/v1/documentation/api/latest/guide/credentials.html), such as the `~/.aws/credentials` file:

    ```ini
    [default]
    aws_access_key_id = YOUR_KEY
    aws_secret_access_key = YOUR_SECRET
    ```

2.  **Set a default region:** Configure a default region in your `~/.aws/config` file:

    ```ini
    [default]
    region=us-east-1
    ```

### Usage Example

```python
import boto3

# Create an S3 resource
s3 = boto3.resource('s3')

# Iterate through all buckets
for bucket in s3.buckets.all():
    print(bucket.name)
```
