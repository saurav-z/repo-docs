## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
*   A supported version of Python installed.

### Installation

1.  **Create a virtual environment (recommended):**

    ```bash
    python -m venv .venv
    . .venv/bin/activate  # On Linux/macOS
    # or
    . .venv\Scripts\activate # On Windows
    ```

2.  **Install Boto3 using pip:**

    ```bash
    python -m pip install boto3
    ```

    or install from source:
    ```bash
    $ git clone https://github.com/boto/boto3.git
    $ cd boto3
    $ python -m pip install -r requirements.txt
    $ python -m pip install -e .
    ```

### Configuration
Configure your AWS credentials and default region.

1.  **Set up credentials** (e.g., in `~/.aws/credentials`):

    ```ini
    [default]
    aws_access_key_id = YOUR_KEY
    aws_secret_access_key = YOUR_SECRET
    ```

2.  **Set up a default region** (e.g., in `~/.aws/config`):

    ```ini
    [default]
    region=us-east-1
    ```

### Example Usage
```python
import boto3
s3 = boto3.resource('s3')
for bucket in s3.buckets.all():
        print(bucket.name)
```

## Running Tests
