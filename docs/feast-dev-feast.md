## Feast: The Open Source Feature Store for Machine Learning

Feast is an open-source feature store that streamlines the management of feature data for machine learning, offering a seamless path from raw data to production-ready features.  ([View the source code on GitHub](https://github.com/feast-dev/feast))

## Key Features

*   **Consistent Feature Availability:** Manage offline and online stores for training and real-time serving, as well as a feature server.
*   **Data Leakage Prevention:** Generate point-in-time correct feature sets to ensure data scientists can focus on feature engineering.
*   **Decoupled ML Infrastructure:**  Provides a unified data access layer, abstracting feature storage and retrieval for portability across various ML stages and systems.

## Overview

<a href="https://trendshift.io/repositories/8046" target="_blank"><img src="https://trendshift.io/api/badge/repositories/8046" alt="feast-dev%2Ffeast | Trendshift" style="width: 250px; height: 55px;" width="250" height="55"/></a>

Feast (**Fea**ture **St**ore) is an open source feature store for machine learning. Feast is the fastest path to manage existing infrastructure to productionize analytic data for model training and online inference.

Feast allows ML platform teams to:

*   **Make features consistently available for training and serving** by managing an _offline store_ (to process historical data for scale-out batch scoring or model training), a low-latency _online store_ (to power real-time prediction)_,_ and a battle-tested _feature server_ (to serve pre-computed features online).
*   **Avoid data leakage** by generating point-in-time correct feature sets so data scientists can focus on feature engineering rather than debugging error-prone dataset joining logic. This ensure that future feature values do not leak to models during training.
*   **Decouple ML from data infrastructure** by providing a single data access layer that abstracts feature storage from feature retrieval, ensuring models remain portable as you move from training models to serving models, from batch models to realtime models, and from one data infra system to another.

Please see our [documentation](https://docs.feast.dev/) for more information about the project.

## üìê Architecture

![](docs/assets/feast_marchitecture.png)

The above architecture is the minimal Feast deployment. Want to run the full Feast on Snowflake/GCP/AWS? Click [here](https://docs.feast.dev/how-to-guides/feast-snowflake-gcp-aws).

## üê£ Getting Started

### 1. Install Feast

```commandline
pip install feast
```

### 2. Create a feature repository

```commandline
feast init my_feature_repo
cd my_feature_repo/feature_repo
```

### 3. Register your feature definitions and set up your feature store

```commandline
feast apply
```

### 4. Explore your data in the web UI (experimental)

![Web UI](ui/sample.png)
```commandline
feast ui
```

### 5. Build a training dataset

```python
from feast import FeatureStore
import pandas as pd
from datetime import datetime

entity_df = pd.DataFrame.from_dict({
    "driver_id": [1001, 1002, 1003, 1004],
    "event_timestamp": [
        datetime(2021, 4, 12, 10, 59, 42),
        datetime(2021, 4, 12, 8,  12, 10),
        datetime(2021, 4, 12, 16, 40, 26),
        datetime(2021, 4, 12, 15, 1 , 12)
    ]
})

store = FeatureStore(repo_path=".")

training_df = store.get_historical_features(
    entity_df=entity_df,
    features = [
        'driver_hourly_stats:conv_rate',
        'driver_hourly_stats:acc_rate',
        'driver_hourly_stats:avg_daily_trips'
    ],
).to_df()

print(training_df.head())

# Train model
# model = ml.fit(training_df)
```
```commandline
            event_timestamp  driver_id  conv_rate  acc_rate  avg_daily_trips
0 2021-04-12 08:12:10+00:00       1002   0.713465  0.597095              531
1 2021-04-12 10:59:42+00:00       1001   0.072752  0.044344               11
2 2021-04-12 15:01:12+00:00       1004   0.658182  0.079150              220
3 2021-04-12 16:40:26+00:00       1003   0.162092  0.309035              959

```

### 6. Load feature values into your online store

```commandline
CURRENT_TIME=$(date -u +"%Y-%m-%dT%H:%M:%S")
feast materialize-incremental $CURRENT_TIME
```

```commandline
Materializing feature view driver_hourly_stats from 2021-04-14 to 2021-04-15 done!
```

### 7. Read online features at low latency

```python
from pprint import pprint
from feast import FeatureStore

store = FeatureStore(repo_path=".")

feature_vector = store.get_online_features(
    features=[
        'driver_hourly_stats:conv_rate',
        'driver_hourly_stats:acc_rate',
        'driver_hourly_stats:avg_daily_trips'
    ],
    entity_rows=[{"driver_id": 1001}]
).to_dict()

pprint(feature_vector)

# Make prediction
# model.predict(feature_vector)
```
```json
{
    "driver_id": [1001],
    "driver_hourly_stats__conv_rate": [0.49274],
    "driver_hourly_stats__acc_rate": [0.92743],
    "driver_hourly_stats__avg_daily_trips": [72]
}
```
