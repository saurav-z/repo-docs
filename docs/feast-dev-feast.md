## Feast: The Open-Source Feature Store for Machine Learning

[Feast](https://github.com/feast-dev/feast) (**Fea**ture **St**ore) is an open-source feature store that streamlines the development and deployment of machine learning models by providing a centralized, consistent, and reliable source of features for both training and online serving.

## Key Features

*   **Consistent Feature Availability:**  Manage both offline and online stores to ensure features are available for training and real-time predictions.
*   **Data Leakage Prevention:**  Generate point-in-time correct feature sets to avoid data leakage and ensure model accuracy.
*   **Decoupled Infrastructure:**  Abstract feature storage from feature retrieval, making your models portable and adaptable across different data infrastructures.
*   **Feature Engineering:**  Develop and manage feature transformations and enrichment logic to streamline feature creation.
*   **Scalability and Performance:** Designed for high-throughput, low-latency feature serving for real-time applications.
*   **Feature Discovery & Governance:**  Browse, search, and manage feature definitions, ensuring discoverability and governance across your feature store.

## Overview

Feast provides a single data access layer that abstracts feature storage from feature retrieval, ensuring models remain portable as you move from training models to serving models, from batch models to realtime models, and from one data infra system to another.

The above architecture is the minimal Feast deployment. Want to run the full Feast on Snowflake/GCP/AWS? Click [here](https://docs.feast.dev/how-to-guides/feast-snowflake-gcp-aws).

## üê£ Getting Started

### 1. Install Feast
```commandline
pip install feast
```

### 2. Create a feature repository
```commandline
feast init my_feature_repo
cd my_feature_repo/feature_repo
```

### 3. Register your feature definitions and set up your feature store
```commandline
feast apply
```

### 4. Explore your data in the web UI (experimental)

![Web UI](ui/sample.png)
```commandline
feast ui
```

### 5. Build a training dataset
```python
from feast import FeatureStore
import pandas as pd
from datetime import datetime

entity_df = pd.DataFrame.from_dict({
    "driver_id": [1001, 1002, 1003, 1004],
    "event_timestamp": [
        datetime(2021, 4, 12, 10, 59, 42),
        datetime(2021, 4, 12, 8,  12, 10),
        datetime(2021, 4, 12, 16, 40, 26),
        datetime(2021, 4, 12, 15, 1 , 12)
    ]
})

store = FeatureStore(repo_path=".")

training_df = store.get_historical_features(
    entity_df=entity_df,
    features = [
        'driver_hourly_stats:conv_rate',
        'driver_hourly_stats:acc_rate',
        'driver_hourly_stats:avg_daily_trips'
    ],
).to_df()

print(training_df.head())

# Train model
# model = ml.fit(training_df)
```
```commandline
            event_timestamp  driver_id  conv_rate  acc_rate  avg_daily_trips
0 2021-04-12 08:12:10+00:00       1002   0.713465  0.597095              531
1 2021-04-12 10:59:42+00:00       1001   0.072752  0.044344               11
2 2021-04-12 15:01:12+00:00       1004   0.658182  0.079150              220
3 2021-04-12 16:40:26+00:00       1003   0.162092  0.309035              959

```

### 6. Load feature values into your online store
```commandline
CURRENT_TIME=$(date -u +"%Y-%m-%dT%H:%M:%S")
feast materialize-incremental $CURRENT_TIME
```

```commandline
Materializing feature view driver_hourly_stats from 2021-04-14 to 2021-04-15 done!
```

### 7. Read online features at low latency
```python
from pprint import pprint
from feast import FeatureStore

store = FeatureStore(repo_path=".")

feature_vector = store.get_online_features(
    features=[
        'driver_hourly_stats:conv_rate',
        'driver_hourly_stats:acc_rate',
        'driver_hourly_stats:avg_daily_trips'
    ],
    entity_rows=[{"driver_id": 1001}]
).to_dict()

pprint(feature_vector)

# Make prediction
# model.predict(feature_vector)
```
```json
{
    "driver_id": [1001],
    "driver_hourly_stats__conv_rate": [0.49274],
    "driver_hourly_stats__acc_rate": [0.92743],
    "driver_hourly_stats__avg_daily_trips": [72]
}
```
