## üéâ Feast: Your Open-Source Feature Store for Machine Learning

Feast (**Fea**ture **St**ore) is the open-source feature store that simplifies the journey from raw data to production-ready features, accelerating machine learning pipelines.  Discover how Feast can help you build and manage features effectively.

### Key Features:

*   **Consistent Feature Availability:** Manage both offline and online stores to ensure features are consistently available for both model training and real-time predictions.
*   **Data Leakage Prevention:** Generate point-in-time correct feature sets to avoid data leakage, allowing data scientists to focus on model building.
*   **Decoupled Infrastructure:** Abstract feature storage from retrieval, enabling seamless transitions between training and serving, batch and real-time models, and different data infrastructure systems.
*   **Feature Serving:** Easily serve pre-computed features online for low-latency predictions.
*   **Comprehensive Data Source Support:** Integrate with a wide variety of data sources, including Snowflake, BigQuery, Redshift, and more.
*   **Extensible and Customizable:** Benefit from a growing ecosystem of community plugins and the ability to customize your feature store.

### 5. Build a Training Dataset
```python
from feast import FeatureStore
import pandas as pd
from datetime import datetime

entity_df = pd.DataFrame.from_dict({
    "driver_id": [1001, 1002, 1003, 1004],
    "event_timestamp": [
        datetime(2021, 4, 12, 10, 59, 42),
        datetime(2021, 4, 12, 8,  12, 10),
        datetime(2021, 4, 12, 16, 40, 26),
        datetime(2021, 4, 12, 15, 1 , 12)
    ]
})

store = FeatureStore(repo_path=".")

training_df = store.get_historical_features(
    entity_df=entity_df,
    features = [
        'driver_hourly_stats:conv_rate',
        'driver_hourly_stats:acc_rate',
        'driver_hourly_stats:avg_daily_trips'
    ],
).to_df()

print(training_df.head())

# Train model
# model = ml.fit(training_df)
```
```
            event_timestamp  driver_id  conv_rate  acc_rate  avg_daily_trips
0 2021-04-12 08:12:10+00:00       1002   0.713465  0.597095              531

2 2021-04-12 15:01:12+00:00       1004   0.658182  0.079150              220
3 2021-04-12 16:40:26+00:00       1003   0.162092  0.309035              959

```

### 6. Load Feature Values into Your Online Store
```bash
CURRENT_TIME=$(date -u +"%Y-%m-%dT%H:%M:%S")
feast materialize-incremental $CURRENT_TIME
```

```

```

### 7. Read Online Features at Low Latency
```python
from pprint import pprint
from feast import FeatureStore

store = FeatureStore(repo_path=".")

feature_vector = store.get_online_features(
    features=[
        'driver_hourly_stats:conv_rate',
        'driver_hourly_stats:acc_rate',
        'driver_hourly_stats:avg_daily_trips'
    ],
    entity_rows=[{"driver_id": 1001}]
).to_dict()

pprint(feature_vector)

# Make prediction
# model.predict(feature_vector)
```
```json
{
    "driver_id": [1001],
    "driver_hourly_stats__conv_rate": [0.49274],
    "driver_hourly_stats__acc_rate": [0.92743],
