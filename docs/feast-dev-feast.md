## Key Features

*   **Unified Feature Access:** Provides a single interface for accessing features consistently across training and serving pipelines.
*   **Data Leakage Prevention:** Generates point-in-time correct feature sets, eliminating the risk of data leakage and ensuring model accuracy.
*   **Infrastructure Decoupling:** Abstracts feature storage from retrieval, allowing for model portability and flexibility in infrastructure choices.
*   **Offline & Online Stores:** Manages an offline store for batch processing and model training, and a low-latency online store for real-time prediction.
*   **Feature Server:** Includes a battle-tested feature server for efficient online feature serving.
*   **Feature Engineering Capabilities:** Support for on-demand and streaming transformations.

## Getting Started

### 1. Install Feast

```bash
pip install feast
```

### 2. Initialize a Feature Repository

```bash
feast init my_feature_repo
cd my_feature_repo/feature_repo
```

### 3. Apply Feature Definitions

```bash
feast apply
```

### 4. Explore the Web UI (Experimental)

![Web UI](ui/sample.png)

```bash
feast ui
```

### 5. Build a Training Dataset

```python
from feast import FeatureStore
import pandas as pd
from datetime import datetime

entity_df = pd.DataFrame.from_dict({
    "driver_id": [1001, 1002, 1003, 1004],
    "event_timestamp": [
        datetime(2021, 4, 12, 10, 59, 42),
        datetime(2021, 4, 12, 8,  12, 10),
        datetime(2021, 4, 12, 16, 40, 26),
        datetime(2021, 4, 12, 15, 1 , 12)
    ]
})

store = FeatureStore(repo_path=".")

training_df = store.get_historical_features(
    entity_df=entity_df,
    features = [
        'driver_hourly_stats:conv_rate',
        'driver_hourly_stats:acc_rate',
        'driver_hourly_stats:avg_daily_trips'
    ],
).to_df()

print(training_df.head())

# Train model
# model = ml.fit(training_df)
```

```
            event_timestamp  driver_id  conv_rate  acc_rate  avg_daily_trips
0 2021-04-12 08:12:10+00:00       1002   0.713465  0.597095              531
1 2021-04-12 10:59:42+00:00       1001   0.072752  0.044344               11
2 2021-04-12 15:01:12+00:00       1004   0.658182  0.079150              220
3 2021-04-12 16:40:26+00:00       1003   0.162092  0.309035              959
```

### 6. Materialize Feature Values

```bash
CURRENT_TIME=$(date -u +"%Y-%m-%dT%H:%M:%S")
feast materialize-incremental $CURRENT_TIME
```

```
Materializing feature view driver_hourly_stats from 2021-04-14 to 2021-04-15 done!
```

### 7. Read Online Features

```python
from pprint import pprint
from feast import FeatureStore

store = FeatureStore(repo_path=".")

feature_vector = store.get_online_features(
    features=[
        'driver_hourly_stats:conv_rate',
        'driver_hourly_stats:acc_rate',
        'driver_hourly_stats:avg_daily_trips'
    ],
    entity_rows=[{"driver_id": 1001}]
).to_dict()

pprint(feature_vector)

# Make prediction
# model.predict(feature_vector)
```

```json
{
    "driver_id": [1001],
    "driver_hourly_stats__conv_rate": [0.49274],
    "driver_hourly_stats__acc_rate": [0.92743],
    "driver_hourly_stats__avg_daily_trips": [72]
}
```
