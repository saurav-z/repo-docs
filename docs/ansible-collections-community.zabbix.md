## Installation

### Requirements

Ensure your environment meets the necessary prerequisites before installing the collection. Review the documentation of the components you want to use for specific requirements.

This collection is tested and maintained against:

*   Ansible Core >= 2.16
*   Python >= 3.9

#### External Collections

*   `ansible.posix` (for SELinux support)
*   `ansible.general` (for SELinux support)
*   `ansible.netcommon` (for agent role)
*   `community.mysql` (for proxy or server roles if using MySQL)
*   `community.postgresql` (for proxy or server roles if using PostgreSQL)
*   `community.windows` (for agent role if installing on Windows)

Install these collections with:

```bash
ansible-galaxy collection install ansible.posix
ansible-galaxy collection install community.general
ansible-galaxy collection install ansible.netcommon
```

### Installing the Collection from Ansible Galaxy

Use the Ansible Galaxy CLI to install the `community.zabbix` collection:

```bash
ansible-galaxy collection install community.zabbix
```

Alternatively, include it in a `requirements.yml` file:

```yaml
---
collections:
  - name: community.zabbix
    version: 4.1.1
  - name: ansible.posix
    version: 1.3.0
  - name: community.general
    version: 3.7.0
```

and install using:

```bash
ansible-galaxy collection install -r requirements.yml
```

## Usage

Use modules and roles from this collection by referencing their Fully Qualified Collection Namespace (FQCN).

```yaml
---
- name: Install Zabbix Agent
  hosts: all
  roles:
    - role: community.zabbix.zabbix_agent
      zabbix_agent_server: zabbix.example.com
      ...
```

You can also include the collection in your playbook's `collections` element:

```yaml
---
- name: Manage Zabbix with collection
  hosts: localhost
  collections:
    - community.zabbix

  roles:
    - role: zabbix_agent
      zabbix_agent_server: zabbix.example.com
      ...
```

*For detailed examples and usage information, refer to the module and role documentation linked in the [Included content](#included-content) section.*

**Basic Authentication:**

To use basic authentication with the Zabbix API, define these variables:

```yaml
zabbix_api_http_user: "user"
zabbix_api_http_password: "password"
```
