To quickly set up a `docker compose` environment, run the following installation script:

```bash
bash -c "$(curl -L https://raw.githubusercontent.com/paperless-ngx/paperless-ngx/main/install-paperless-ngx.sh)"

## Important Security Note

> Document scanners are typically used to scan sensitive documents like your social insurance number, tax records, invoices, etc. **Paperless-ngx should never be run on an untrusted host** because information is stored in clear text without encryption. No guarantees are made regarding security (but we do try!) and you use the app at your own risk.
> **The safest way to run Paperless-ngx is on a local server in your own home with backups in place**.
