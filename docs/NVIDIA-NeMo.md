# NVIDIA NeMo Framework: Build, Customize, and Deploy Generative AI Models

NVIDIA NeMo is a powerful, cloud-native framework that empowers researchers and developers to create state-of-the-art generative AI models efficiently.  [Explore the original repository](https://github.com/NVIDIA/NeMo)

## Key Features

*   **Large Language Models (LLMs):** Develop and train advanced language models.
*   **Multimodal Models (MMs):** Build models that process and generate multiple data types (text, images, etc.).
*   **Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR):** Create accurate speech-to-text models.
*   **Text-to-Speech (TTS):** Develop high-quality speech synthesis systems.
*   **Computer Vision (CV):** Implement computer vision solutions with ease.
*   **Modular and Scalable:** Designed for efficient training across thousands of GPUs.
*   **Pre-trained Models & Recipes:** Leverage existing models and training recipes for rapid development.
*   **Flexible Deployment:** Deploy and optimize models using NVIDIA Riva and NeMo Microservices.

## What's New

*   **Hugging Face Integration:** Seamlessly pretrain and fine-tune Hugging Face models using the new AutoModel feature.
*   **Blackwell Support:**  Enhanced performance with support for NVIDIA Blackwell architecture, offering significant speed improvements.
*   **Performance Tuning Guide:** Access a comprehensive guide to optimize your model training for maximum throughput.
*   **Expanded Model Support:** Includes support for the latest community models like Llama 4, Flux, and Hyena & Evo2.
*   **Cosmos World Foundation Models:** Train and customize video foundation models with NeMo Curator and NeMo Framework.

## Getting Started

*   **Quickstart with NeMo 2.0:** Utilize [Quickstart](https://docs.nvidia.com/nemo-framework/user-guide/latest/nemo-2.0/quickstart.html) for examples and NeMo-Run for launching experiments.
*   **NeMo Framework User Guide:** Access comprehensive documentation to learn all the features and details to get started.
*   **Explore the Feature Guide:** Understand key features to take the next step.
*   **Migration Guide:**  Follow the [Migration Guide](https://docs.nvidia.com/nemo-framework/user-guide/latest/nemo-2.0/migration/index.html#migration-guide) to transition from NeMo 1.0 to 2.0.
*   **NGC and Hugging Face Hub:**  Find pre-trained NeMo models on [Hugging Face Hub](https://huggingface.co/models?library=nemo&sort=downloads&search=nvidia) and [NVIDIA NGC](https://catalog.ngc.nvidia.com/models?query=nemo&orderBy=weightPopularDESC) to get started.
*   **Tutorials & Playbooks:** Run extensive [tutorials](https://docs.nvidia.com/deeplearning/nemo/user-guide/docs/en/stable/starthere/tutorials.html) or utilize [playbooks](https://docs.nvidia.com/nemo-framework/user-guide/latest/playbooks/index.html).
*   **Example Scripts:** Explore [example scripts](https://github.com/NVIDIA/NeMo/tree/main/examples) for advanced training scenarios.
