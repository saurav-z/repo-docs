## Introduction

NVIDIA NeMo is a cutting-edge framework designed to streamline the development of generative AI models across multiple domains.  It provides the tools to efficiently create, customize, and deploy models, and leverages existing code and pre-trained model checkpoints.

## Core Features

*   **Scalability:** Training automatically scales to thousands of GPUs using NeMo-Run.
*   **Advanced Training Techniques:** Leverages parallelism strategies including Tensor Parallelism (TP), Pipeline Parallelism (PP), Fully Sharded Data Parallelism (FSDP), Mixture-of-Experts (MoE), and Mixed Precision Training with BFloat16 and FP8.
*   **NVIDIA Transformer Engine Integration:**  Utilizes NVIDIA Transformer Engine for FP8 training on NVIDIA Hopper GPUs.
*   **Megatron Core Integration:** Utilizes NVIDIA Megatron Core for scaling Transformer model training.
*   **Alignment Techniques:** Supports state-of-the-art model alignment techniques such as SteerLM, Direct Preference Optimization (DPO), and Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF).
*   **PEFT Support:**  Supports parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) techniques such as LoRA, P-Tuning, Adapters, and IA3.
*   **Deployment and Optimization:** Optimized for deployment with NVIDIA NeMo Microservices and NVIDIA Riva.

## Getting Started

1.  **Pre-trained Models:** Leverage state-of-the-art pre-trained models readily available on [Hugging Face Hub](https://huggingface.co/models?library=nemo&sort=downloads&search=nvidia) and [NVIDIA NGC](https://catalog.ngc.nvidia.com/models?query=nemo&orderBy=weightPopularDESC).
2.  **Tutorials:** Comprehensive tutorials are available on [Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com).
3.  **Example Scripts:** Access example scripts to train NeMo models from scratch or fine-tune existing models.
4.  **NGC Container:** Use the pre-built container using [NVIDIA NGC](https://catalog.ngc.nvidia.com/models?query=nemo&orderBy=weightPopularDESC).
5.  **Install with Conda/Pip**

## Installation

Choose the installation method that best suits your needs:

*   **Conda / Pip:**  Ideal for exploring NeMo on supported platforms and recommended for ASR and TTS domains.
*   **NGC PyTorch Container:** Install NeMo from source within an optimized NVIDIA PyTorch container.
*   **NGC NeMo Container:** Ready-to-go solution with all dependencies installed.

Key improvements and SEO considerations:

*   **Clear Headline:**  Uses the most relevant keywords ("NVIDIA NeMo," "Generative AI") and the key function ("Build, Customize, and Deploy").
*   **One-Sentence Hook:** Provides an immediate understanding of the framework's purpose.
*   **Keywords Throughout:**  Repeats relevant keywords naturally throughout the description (e.g., "generative AI," "LLMs," "ASR," "TTS").
*   **Bulleted Key Features:**  Emphasizes key capabilities.
*   **Organized Headings:**  Improves readability and SEO by structuring the content logically.
*   **Concise Summaries:** Replaces verbose blocks with bullet points and condensed text, making information more accessible.
