# NVIDIA NeMo: Build, Customize, and Deploy State-of-the-Art Generative AI Models

[NVIDIA NeMo](https://github.com/NVIDIA/NeMo) is a cloud-native framework designed for researchers and developers, simplifying the creation, customization, and deployment of Large Language Models (LLMs), Multimodal Models (MMs), Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR), Text-to-Speech (TTS), and Computer Vision (CV) models.

## Key Features

*   **Comprehensive AI Domains:** Supports LLMs, MMs, ASR, TTS, and CV.
*   **Modular and Flexible:** Built on PyTorch Lightning for ease of use and customization.
*   **Scalable Training:** Enables efficient training across thousands of GPUs.
*   **Pre-trained Models:** Access to a wide range of pre-trained models on Hugging Face Hub and NVIDIA NGC.
*   **Deployment Options:** Optimized for deployment with NVIDIA Riva and NeMo Microservices.
*   **Cutting-Edge Techniques:** Incorporates advanced techniques like Tensor Parallelism, Pipeline Parallelism, FSDP, MoE, and mixed precision training.
*   **PEFT and Alignment Support:** Supports Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning (PEFT) methods like LoRA and alignment methods such as SteerLM, DPO, and RLHF.
*   **Cosmos World Foundation Model Integration:** Supports training and customization of the NVIDIA Cosmos collection of world foundation models.

## Latest Updates

*   **Hugging Face Integration:** Seamlessly pretrain and fine-tune Hugging Face models via AutoModel, with initial support for AutoModelForCausalLM and AutoModelForImageTextToText. (May 19, 2025)
*   **Blackwell Support:** Performance benchmarks on GB200 & B200. (May 19, 2025)
*   **Performance Tuning Guide:** Comprehensive guide for performance tuning to achieve optimal throughput. (May 19, 2025)
*   **New Model Support:** Expanded support for Llama 4, Flux, Llama Nemotron, Hyena & Evo2, Qwen2-VL, Qwen2.5, Gemma3, Qwen3-30B&32B. (May 19, 2025)
*   **NeMo 2.0 Release:** Focuses on modularity and ease-of-use, with a transition to Python-based configuration and modular abstractions.
