## LLMs and MMs Training, Alignment, and Customization

All NeMo models are trained with
[Lightning](https://github.com/Lightning-AI/lightning). Training is
automatically scalable to 1000s of GPUs. You can check the performance benchmarks using the
latest NeMo Framework container [here](https://docs.nvidia.com/nemo-framework/user-guide/latest/performance/performance_summary.html).

When applicable, NeMo models leverage cutting-edge distributed training
techniques, incorporating [parallelism
strategies](https://docs.nvidia.com/nemo-framework/user-guide/latest/modeloverview.html)
to enable efficient training of very large models. These techniques
include Tensor Parallelism (TP), Pipeline Parallelism (PP), Fully
Sharded Data Parallelism (FSDP), Mixture-of-Experts (MoE), and Mixed
Precision Training with BFloat16 and FP8, as well as others.

NeMo Transformer-based LLMs and MMs utilize [NVIDIA Transformer
Engine](https://github.com/NVIDIA/TransformerEngine) for FP8 training on
NVIDIA Hopper GPUs, while leveraging [NVIDIA Megatron
Core](https://github.com/NVIDIA/Megatron-LM/tree/main/megatron/core) for
scaling Transformer model training.

NeMo LLMs can be aligned with state-of-the-art methods such as SteerLM,
Direct Preference Optimization (DPO), and Reinforcement Learning from
Human Feedback (RLHF). See [NVIDIA NeMo
Aligner](https://github.com/NVIDIA/NeMo-Aligner) for more information.

In addition to supervised fine-tuning (SFT), NeMo also supports the
latest parameter efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) techniques such as LoRA,
P-Tuning, Adapters, and IA3. Refer to the [NeMo Framework User
Guide](https://docs.nvidia.com/nemo-framework/user-guide/latest/sft_peft/index.html)
for the full list of supported models and techniques.
