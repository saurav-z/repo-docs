*   **Multimodal Models (MMs):** Develop models that integrate text, images, and other modalities.
*   **Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR):** Build accurate and efficient speech recognition systems.
*   **Text-to-Speech (TTS):** Create high-quality speech synthesis models.
*   **Computer Vision (CV):** Implement advanced computer vision tasks.
*   **Modular Design:** Leverage PyTorch Lightning's modular abstractions for flexibility and experimentation.
*   **Scalability:** Scale training across thousands of GPUs with [NeMo-Run](https://github.com/NVIDIA/NeMo-Run).
*   **Optimizations:** Utilize NVIDIA Transformer Engine, Megatron Core, and cutting-edge distributed training techniques for optimal performance.

*   **New Models Support:**  Support for latest community models: Llama 4, Flux, Llama Nemotron, Hyena & Evo2, Qwen2-VL, Qwen2.5, Gemma3, Qwen3-30B&32B.
*   **NeMo Framework 2.0:** Prioritizes modularity and ease-of-use; see the [NeMo Framework User Guide](https://docs.nvidia.com/nemo-framework/user-guide/latest/nemo-2.0/index.html) to get started.
*   **Cosmos World Foundation Models Support:**  Support for NVIDIA Cosmos world foundation models, including video processing with NeMo Curator.

## Getting Started

### Installation

Choose your installation method based on your needs:

*   **Conda / Pip:**
    *   Suitable for exploring NeMo on various platforms, and recommended for ASR/TTS.
    *   ```bash
        conda create --name nemo python==3.10.12
        conda activate nemo
        pip install "nemo_toolkit[all]"
        ```
*   **NGC PyTorch Container:**
    *   Recommended starting point; install from source within a highly optimized container (nvcr.io/nvidia/pytorch:25.01-py3).
    *   Follow instructions in the original README.
*   **NGC NeMo Container:**
    *   Provides a ready-to-use, high-performance environment.
    *   ```bash
        docker run \
          --gpus all \
          -it \
          --rm \
          --shm-size=16g \
          --ulimit memlock=-1 \
          --ulimit stack=67108864 \
          nvcr.io/nvidia/pytorch:${NV_PYTORCH_TAG:-'nvcr.io/nvidia/nemo:25.02'}
        ```

### Quickstart

*   Refer to the [Quickstart](https://docs.nvidia.com/nemo-framework/user-guide/latest/nemo-2.0/quickstart.html) for examples of using NeMo-Run to launch NeMo 2.0 experiments locally and on a slurm cluster.
*   For more information about NeMo 2.0, see the [NeMo Framework User Guide](https://docs.nvidia.com/nemo-framework/user-guide/latest/nemo-2.0/index.html).
*   [NeMo 2.0 Recipes](https://github.com/NVIDIA/NeMo/blob/main/nemo/collections/llm/recipes) contains additional examples of launching large-scale runs using NeMo 2.0 and NeMo-Run.
*   For an in-depth exploration of the main features of NeMo 2.0, see the [Feature Guide](https://docs.nvidia.com/nemo-framework/user-guide/latest/nemo-2.0/features/index.html#feature-guide).
*   To transition from NeMo 1.0 to 2.0, see the [Migration Guide](https://docs.nvidia.com/nemo-framework/user-guide/latest/nemo-2.0/migration/index.html#migration-guide) for step-by-step instructions.
