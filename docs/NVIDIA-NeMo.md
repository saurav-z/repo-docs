# NVIDIA NeMo: Build, Customize, and Deploy Generative AI Models at Scale

NVIDIA NeMo is a cloud-native framework designed to streamline the creation, customization, and deployment of large language models (LLMs), multimodal models (MMs), and other generative AI models.  [Explore the original repository on GitHub](https://github.com/NVIDIA/NeMo).

## Key Features

*   **Large Language Models (LLMs):** Train, customize, and deploy state-of-the-art LLMs.
*   **Multimodal Models (MMs):** Develop models that combine different data types like text and images.
*   **Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR):** Build and optimize ASR models.
*   **Text-to-Speech (TTS):** Create high-quality speech synthesis systems.
*   **Computer Vision (CV):** Implement and experiment with cutting-edge CV models.
*   **Scalability:**  Easily scale training across thousands of GPUs using NeMo-Run.
*   **Flexibility:**  Leverage Python-based configuration for advanced customization.
*   **Pre-trained Models:** Utilize pre-trained models from Hugging Face Hub and NVIDIA NGC.
*   **Performance Optimization:** Benefit from NVIDIA Transformer Engine and Megatron Core for optimized performance on NVIDIA hardware.
*   **Deployment and Optimization:** Deploy with NVIDIA NeMo Microservices and optimize speech AI with NVIDIA Riva.

## What's New

*   **Support for Hugging Face Models:** Seamlessly integrate and fine-tune models from Hugging Face, including `AutoModelForCausalLM` and `AutoModelForImageTextToText`.
*   **Blackwell Support:**  Optimized performance on GB200 and B200 GPUs.
*   **Performance Tuning Guide:**  Comprehensive guide for optimal throughput.
*   **New Model Support:**  Includes Llama 4, Flux, Llama Nemotron, Hyena & Evo2, Qwen2-VL, Qwen2.5, Gemma3, Qwen3-30B&32B.
*   **NeMo 2.0:**  Significant improvements in modularity, ease of use, and scalability with Python-based configuration and modular abstractions.
*   **Cosmos World Foundation Models:** Support for training and customizing NVIDIA Cosmos models for advanced tasks.

## Getting Started

NeMo offers multiple ways to get started.

### Installation

Choose the installation method that best suits your needs:
