# NVIDIA NeMo: Build and Deploy Generative AI Models at Scale

NVIDIA NeMo is a cloud-native framework empowering researchers and developers to efficiently create, customize, and deploy state-of-the-art generative AI models for Large Language Models (LLMs), Multimodal Models (MMs), Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR), Text-to-Speech (TTS), and Computer Vision (CV). ([Original Repository](https://github.com/NVIDIA/NeMo))

## Key Features

*   **LLMs and MMs:** Training, alignment (SteerLM, DPO, RLHF), and customization with PEFT techniques (LoRA, etc.).
*   **Speech AI:** Optimized ASR and TTS models with NVIDIA Riva integration.
*   **Multimodal Capabilities:** Support for video and image generation with NeMo Curator and Cosmos World Foundation Models.
*   **Modular Design:** Python-based configuration and PyTorch Lightning modular abstractions for flexibility.
*   **Scalability:** Built-in support for training across thousands of GPUs with NeMo-Run, including advanced parallelism strategies.
*   **Integration:** Seamless integration with Hugging Face models via AutoModel.
