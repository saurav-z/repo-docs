## Key Features

*   **Pseudo 3-Tier Architecture:**  Employs a well-defined architectural pattern (with API, Schema, Service, CRUD, and Model layers), enabling maintainability and scalability.
*   **Modern Technologies:**  Leverages the power of FastAPI, Pydantic v2, SQLAlchemy, and other cutting-edge tools.
*   **Database Agnostic:** Supports both MySQL and PostgreSQL databases.
*   **Robust Code Quality:** Enforces code style and best practices with Ruff and other linters/formatters.
*   **Docker Support:**  Includes Docker configuration for easy deployment and containerization.

## Architecture Overview

This project implements a "pseudo 3-tier" architecture, which is a flexible approach to structuring your FastAPI applications. It mirrors common patterns found in other backend frameworks while offering the benefits of FastAPI's performance and simplicity.

| Workflow       | Implementation          |
|----------------|---------------------------|
| View           | API                       |
| Data Transfer  | Schema                    |
| Business Logic | Service                   |
| Data Access    | CRUD                      |
| Model          | Model                     |
