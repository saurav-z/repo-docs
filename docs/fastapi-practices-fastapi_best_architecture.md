## Key Features

*   **Pseudo 3-Tier Architecture:**  Provides a structured approach inspired by 3-tier architecture principles for enhanced organization.
*   **Clear Component Mapping:**  Defines clear mappings between concepts in different architectural styles (e.g., MVC, Java).
*   **Uses modern libraries:** Integrates seamlessly with popular tools such as SQLAlchemy and Pydantic for enhanced functionality.
*   **Containerization:** Supports Docker for easy deployment and environment consistency.
*   **Comprehensive Documentation:** Detailed documentation is available to help you understand and utilize the architecture.

## Architecture Overview

This project employs a *pseudo 3-tier architecture* within a FastAPI context, which maps components to provide structure:

| Workflow        | Corresponding Component   |
|-----------------|---------------------------|
| View            | API                       |
| Data Transfer   | Schema                    |
| Business Logic  | Service                   |
| Data Access     | CRUD                      |
| Model           | Model                     |

## Documentation and Resources

For detailed information on how to use the architecture and its various components, please refer to the [official documentation](https://fastapi-practices.github.io/fastapi_best_architecture_docs/).
