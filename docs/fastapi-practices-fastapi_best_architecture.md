## Key Features

*   **Pseudo 3-Tier Architecture:** Designed with a clear separation of concerns, inspired by a 3-tier architecture pattern. This structure enhances code maintainability and scalability.
*   **Modern Python Technologies:** Leverages the power of FastAPI, Pydantic, and SQLAlchemy.
*   **Database Support:** Compatible with MySQL and PostgreSQL, providing flexibility in your database choice.
*   **Code Quality & Automation:**  Includes Ruff and uv for code quality checks and dependency management.
*   **Docker Support:**  Offers Docker integration for easy deployment and containerization.

## Architecture Overview

The project employs a "pseudo 3-tier" architecture to organize code effectively. This structure includes:

| Component       | Functionality                                          |
|----------------|--------------------------------------------------------|
| API (View)      | Handles incoming requests and responses.              |
| Schema (Data Transfer) | Defines data structures for request/response bodies. |
| Service (Business Logic)  | Contains the core application logic.                  |
| CRUD (Data Access)  | Interacts with the database to perform CRUD operations.   |
| Model           | Represents the data structure in the database.        |
