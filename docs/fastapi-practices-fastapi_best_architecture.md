## Architecture Overview

This project implements a "pseudo 3-tier" architecture, inspired by patterns observed in other frameworks, but adapted for FastAPI. This approach promotes code organization and maintainability, as detailed in the following table:

| Workflow       | Equivalent in Java | FastAPI Best Architecture |
|----------------|-------------------|---------------------------|
| View           | Controller        | API                       |
| Data Transfer  | DTO               | Schema                    |
| Business Logic | Service + Impl    | Service                   |
| Data Access    | DAO / Mapper      | CRUD                      |
| Model          | Model / Entity    | Model                     |
