## Key Features & Benefits

*   **Pseudo 3-Tier Architecture:** Designed to provide a structured and organized codebase, promoting separation of concerns and maintainability.  This approach helps developers understand the different layers of their application.
*   **FastAPI Integration:** Leveraging the speed and efficiency of FastAPI for building high-performance APIs.
*   **Data Validation:** Utilizing Pydantic for robust data validation and type hinting.
*   **Database Support:**  Supporting both MySQL and PostgreSQL for flexible database choices.
*   **ORM with SQLAlchemy:** Integrating SQLAlchemy for efficient database interactions and model management.
*   **Modern Tooling:** Employing Ruff for linting and code quality, and uv for dependency management.
*   **Docker Compatibility:** Easily containerize your application with Docker for consistent deployments.

## Architecture Overview

This project implements a "pseudo 3-tier" architecture. Here's how it maps to common web development patterns:

| Workflow       | Component               |
|----------------|---------------------------|
| View           | API                       |
| Data Transmission | Schema                    |
| Business Logic | Service                   |
| Data Access    | CRUD                      |
| Model          | Model                     |
