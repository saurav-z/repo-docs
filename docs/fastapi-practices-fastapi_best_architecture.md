## Architecture Overview

This project implements a "pseudo 3-tier" architecture, offering a structured approach to backend development.  The core components map as follows:

| Workflow       | Java            | FastAPI Best Architecture |
|----------------|-----------------|---------------------------|
| View           | Controller      | API                       |
| Data Transfer  | DTO             | Schema                    |
| Business Logic | Service + Impl  | Service                   |
| Data Access    | DAO / Mapper    | CRUD                      |
| Model          | Model / Entity  | Model                     |
