## MiniCPM-V: Unleash Powerful On-Device Multimodal AI on Your Phone!

**[OpenBMB/MiniCPM-V](https://github.com/OpenBMB/MiniCPM-V) - Your gateway to cutting-edge, on-device multimodal AI.** This repository provides access to the MiniCPM-V series, a family of efficient Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) that excel at understanding images, videos, text, and even audio, delivering high-quality outputs directly on your device.

**Key Features:**

*   **MiniCPM-V 4.5: The Latest & Greatest** 
    *   **Unrivaled Performance:** Outperforms GPT-4o, Gemini 2.0 Pro, and Qwen2.5-VL 72B in vision-language tasks, all with just 8B parameters!
    *   **High-FPS & Long Video Understanding:** Process long videos and achieve high frame rates for optimal performance.
    *   **Flexible Reasoning:** Includes both fast and deep-thinking modes for efficient and effective responses.
    *   **Advanced Capabilities:** Includes advanced OCR, document parsing, multilingual support, and trustworthy behavior.

*   **MiniCPM-o 2.6: All-in-One Multimodal Mastery**
    *   **GPT-4o Level Performance:** Achieves near GPT-4o-202405 performance in vision, speech, and multimodal streaming.
    *   **Real-Time Bilingual Speech:** Supports bilingual real-time speech conversations with customizable voices.
    *   **Multimodal Live Streaming on Devices:** Seamlessly supports live streaming on devices like iPads.
    *   **Effortless integration:** Deployable with [llama.cpp, Ollama, vLLM](#efficient-inference-with-llamacpp-ollama-vllm), etc.
    *   **Streamlined Functionality:** Can be used to act as an AI assistant, can also be used as an instructor.

*   **Cookbook & Community:** Explore our [MiniCPM-V & o Cookbook](https://github.com/OpenSQZ/MiniCPM-V-CookBook) for easy deployment and usage, and join our [Discord](https://discord.gg/rftuRMbqzf) to collaborate and learn.
