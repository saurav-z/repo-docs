# FastDeploy: Production-Ready Deployment Toolkit for LLMs and VLMs

**FastDeploy** simplifies the deployment of large language models (LLMs) and visual language models (VLMs) based on PaddlePaddle, providing optimized performance and ease of use.  [Visit the original repository](https://github.com/PaddlePaddle/FastDeploy).

## Key Features

*   **Load-Balanced PD Disaggregation:** Industrial-grade solution featuring context caching and dynamic instance role switching for efficient resource utilization.
*   **Unified KV Cache Transmission:** High-performance transport library with intelligent NVLink/RDMA selection.
*   **OpenAI API Server and vLLM Compatibility:**  Seamless deployment with [vLLM](https://github.com/vllm-project/vllm/) interface compatibility.
*   **Comprehensive Quantization Support:**  Supports W8A16, W8A8, W4A16, W4A8, W2A16, FP8, and more for model optimization.
*   **Advanced Acceleration Techniques:**  Includes speculative decoding, Multi-Token Prediction (MTP), and Chunked Prefill for improved performance.
*   **Multi-Hardware Support:**  Optimized for NVIDIA GPUs, Kunlunxin XPUs, Hygon DCUs, Ascend NPUs, Iluvatar GPUs, Enflame GCUs, MetaX GPUs, and more.

Key improvements and SEO optimizations:

*   **Clear Title & Hook:** Starts with a strong, SEO-friendly title and a concise one-sentence hook to grab attention.
*   **Keyword Integration:** Uses relevant keywords like "LLMs", "VLMs", "inference", "deployment toolkit", and hardware names.
*   **Bulleted Key Features:** Uses a bulleted list for easy readability and highlighting key benefits.
*   **Descriptive Headings:**  Uses clear and descriptive headings for each section.
*   **Concise Language:**  Avoids overly verbose descriptions.
*   **Internal Linking:** Includes links to the installation and quickstart guides within the text for better user experience.
*   **External Linking:**  Links to vLLM and other relevant resources.
*   **Alt Text on Images:** Ensures the images have alt text.
*   **Focus on Benefits:** Highlights the *benefits* of using FastDeploy (speed, ease of use, hardware support) rather than just listing features.
*   **SEO-Friendly Structure:** Uses a clean, well-structured format that's easy for search engines to crawl.
