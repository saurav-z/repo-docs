## News

*   **[2025-09] üî• FastDeploy v2.2 is newly released!** Compatibility with models in the HuggingFace ecosystem, further optimized performance, and newly adds support for [baidu/ERNIE-21B-A3B-Thinking](https://huggingface.co/baidu/ERNIE-4.5-21B-A3B-Thinking)!
*   **[2025-08] üî• Released FastDeploy v2.1:** A brand-new KV Cache scheduling strategy has been introduced, and expanded support for PD separation and CUDA Graph across more models. Enhanced hardware support has been added for platforms like Kunlun and Hygon, along with comprehensive optimizations to improve the performance of both the service and inference engine.
*   **[2025-07] The FastDeploy 2.0 Inference Deployment Challenge is now live!** Complete the inference deployment task for the ERNIE 4.5 series open-source models to win official FastDeploy 2.0 merch and generous prizes! üéÅ You're welcome to try it out and share your feedback! üìå[Sign up here](https://www.wjx.top/vm/meSsp3L.aspx#) üìå[Event details](https://github.com/PaddlePaddle/FastDeploy/discussions/2728)
*   **[2025-06] üî• Released FastDeploy v2.0:** Supports inference and deployment for ERNIE 4.5. Furthermore, we open-source an industrial-grade PD disaggregation with context caching, dynamic role switching for effective resource utilization to further enhance inference performance for MoE models.
