# Oils: Upgrade Your Shell with a Modern Language and Runtime

## Key Features:

*   **OSH:** Runs your existing shell scripts, ensuring compatibility.
*   **YSH:**  A new language for Python and JavaScript users who want to avoid Bash.
*   **Fast Performance:**  Written in Python and automatically translated to C++ for speed and a small footprint.
*   **Easy to Contribute:**  The codebase is designed to be easily modified and built upon, with small contributions welcomed.
