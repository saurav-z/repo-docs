**ADK is your flexible, modular, and model-agnostic toolkit for building AI agents.** Optimized for the Google ecosystem but compatible with others, ADK transforms agent development into a streamlined software development experience.  Create, deploy, and orchestrate agents, from simple tasks to complex workflows, with ease.

---

## Key Features:

*   **Rich Tool Ecosystem:** Integrate pre-built tools, custom functions, and OpenAPI specs. ADK seamlessly integrates with the Google ecosystem.
*   **Code-First Development:**  Define agent logic, tools, and orchestration directly in Python for maximum flexibility and version control.
*   **Modular Multi-Agent Systems:** Design scalable applications by composing multiple specialized agents into flexible hierarchies.
*   **Deploy Anywhere:** Easily containerize and deploy agents on Cloud Run or scale seamlessly with Vertex AI Agent Engine.

## ü§ñ Agent-to-Agent (A2A) Protocol Integration

ADK integrates with the [A2A protocol](https://github.com/google-a2a/A2A/) for advanced remote agent communication.  See an [example](https://github.com/a2aproject/a2a-samples/tree/main/samples/python/agents) of how they work together.

## üöÄ Installation

### Stable Release (Recommended)

## üèÅ Feature Highlights

### Define a Single Agent

```python
from google.adk.agents import Agent
from google.adk.tools import google_search

root_agent = Agent(
    name="search_assistant",
    model="gemini-2.0-flash", # Or your preferred Gemini model
    instruction="You are a helpful assistant. Answer user questions using Google Search when needed.",
    description="An assistant that can search the web.",
    tools=[google_search]
)
```

### Define a Multi-Agent System

```python
from google.adk.agents import LlmAgent, BaseAgent

# Define individual agents
greeter = LlmAgent(name="greeter", model="gemini-2.0-flash", ...)
task_executor = LlmAgent(name="task_executor", model="gemini-2.0-flash", ...)

# Create parent agent and assign children via sub_agents
coordinator = LlmAgent(
    name="Coordinator",
    model="gemini-2.0-flash",
    description="I coordinate greetings and tasks.",
    sub_agents=[ # Assign sub_agents here
        greeter,
        task_executor
    ]
)
```

### Development UI

ADK provides a built-in development UI to test, evaluate, debug, and showcase your agent(s).

### Evaluate Agents

```bash
adk eval \
    samples_for_testing/hello_world \
    samples_for_testing/hello_world/hello_world_eval_set_001.evalset.json
```
