ADK is a powerful, open-source toolkit designed for building, evaluating, and deploying sophisticated AI agents.  Optimized for the Google ecosystem, ADK is also model-agnostic and deployment-agnostic, promoting flexibility and control for developers.  It enables a code-first approach, making agent development more like traditional software development, simplifying the creation, deployment, and orchestration of agents for tasks ranging from simple to complex.

## Key Features

*   ‚úÖ **Code-First Development:** Define agent logic, tools, and orchestration directly in Python, maximizing flexibility, testability, and versioning.
*   ‚úÖ **Rich Tool Ecosystem:** Integrate pre-built tools, custom functions, and OpenAPI specs, seamlessly connecting agents to diverse capabilities and the Google ecosystem.
*   ‚úÖ **Modular Multi-Agent Systems:** Design scalable applications by composing multiple specialized agents into flexible hierarchies.
*   ‚úÖ **Deploy Anywhere:** Easily containerize and deploy agents on Cloud Run or scale with Vertex AI Agent Engine.
*   ‚úÖ **Built-in Development UI**: Test, evaluate, debug, and showcase your agent(s).
*   ‚úÖ **Agent Evaluation**: Evaluate agents.
*   ‚úÖ **Agent-to-Agent Communication:** Supports the A2A protocol for remote agent interaction.

## Getting Started

### Installation

#### Stable Release (Recommended)

Install the latest stable version using `pip`:

```bash
pip install google-adk
```

This version is recommended for general use.

#### Development Version

Install directly from the `main` branch for the latest updates:

```bash
pip install git+https://github.com/google/adk-python.git@main
```

*Note: The development version may include experimental features or bugs.*

## Example: Define a single agent

```python
from google.adk.agents import Agent
from google.adk.tools import google_search

root_agent = Agent(
    name="search_assistant",
    model="gemini-2.0-flash", # Or your preferred Gemini model
    instruction="You are a helpful assistant. Answer user questions using Google Search when needed.",
    description="An assistant that can search the web.",
    tools=[google_search]
)
```

## Example: Define a multi-agent system

Define a multi-agent system with coordinator agent, greeter agent, and task execution agent. Then ADK engine and the model will guide the agents works together to accomplish the task.

```python
from google.adk.agents import LlmAgent, BaseAgent

# Define individual agents
greeter = LlmAgent(name="greeter", model="gemini-2.0-flash", ...)
task_executor = LlmAgent(name="task_executor", model="gemini-2.0-flash", ...)

# Create parent agent and assign children via sub_agents
coordinator = LlmAgent(
    name="Coordinator",
    model="gemini-2.0-flash",
    description="I coordinate greetings and tasks.",
    sub_agents=[ # Assign sub_agents here
        greeter,
        task_executor
    ]
)
```

## Example: Evaluate Agents

```bash
adk eval \
    samples_for_testing/hello_world \
    samples_for_testing/hello_world/hello_world_eval_set_001.evalset.json
```
