ADK is a flexible, modular, and model-agnostic Python toolkit designed for building and deploying AI agents. It seamlessly integrates with the Google ecosystem and supports other frameworks. Build agentic architectures ranging from simple tasks to complex workflows with a streamlined developer experience.

## ‚ú® Key Features

*   **Rich Tool Ecosystem:** Integrate pre-built tools, custom functions, and OpenAPI specs to provide agents with diverse capabilities.
*   **Code-First Development:** Define agent logic, tools, and orchestration directly in Python for maximum flexibility, testability, and version control.
*   **Modular Multi-Agent Systems:** Design scalable applications by composing multiple specialized agents into flexible hierarchies.
*   **Deploy Anywhere:** Easily containerize and deploy agents on Cloud Run or scale with Vertex AI Agent Engine.
*   **Built-in Development UI:** Test, evaluate, debug, and showcase your agent(s).

## ü§ñ Agent2Agent (A2A) Protocol Integration

ADK integrates with the [A2A protocol](https://github.com/google-a2a/A2A/) for remote agent-to-agent communication.  See the [A2A samples](https://github.com/a2aproject/a2a-samples/tree/main/samples/python/agents) for examples.

## üöÄ Installation

### Stable Release (Recommended)

Install the latest stable version of ADK using `pip`:

```bash
pip install google-adk
```

The release cadence is weekly.

### Development Version

Install the latest development version directly from the `main` branch:

```bash
pip install git+https://github.com/google/adk-python.git@main
```

**Important:** The development version includes the newest features and fixes, but may also contain experimental changes or bugs. Use it primarily for testing or accessing critical fixes before the official release.

## üé¨ Quickstart: Example Code Snippets

### Define a single agent:

```python
from google.adk.agents import Agent
from google.adk.tools import google_search

root_agent = Agent(
    name="search_assistant",
    model="gemini-2.0-flash", # Or your preferred Gemini model
    instruction="You are a helpful assistant. Answer user questions using Google Search when needed.",
    description="An assistant that can search the web.",
    tools=[google_search]
)
```

### Define a multi-agent system:

```python
from google.adk.agents import LlmAgent, BaseAgent

# Define individual agents
greeter = LlmAgent(name="greeter", model="gemini-2.0-flash", ...)
task_executor = LlmAgent(name="task_executor", model="gemini-2.0-flash", ...)

# Create parent agent and assign children via sub_agents
coordinator = LlmAgent(
    name="Coordinator",
    model="gemini-2.0-flash",
    description="I coordinate greetings and tasks.",
    sub_agents=[ # Assign sub_agents here
        greeter,
        task_executor
    ]
)
```

### Evaluate Agents

```bash
adk eval \
    samples_for_testing/hello_world \
    samples_for_testing/hello_world/hello_world_eval_set_001.evalset.json
```
