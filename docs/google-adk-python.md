The Agent Development Kit (ADK) is a flexible and modular framework designed to streamline the development and deployment of AI agents. Built with a code-first approach, it provides developers with unparalleled control and flexibility for building agentic architectures, from simple tasks to complex, multi-agent systems.

### Key Features:

*   **Rich Tool Ecosystem:** Integrate a wide array of tools, including pre-built tools, custom functions, and OpenAPI specifications, offering agents diverse capabilities.
*   **Code-First Development:** Define agent logic, tools, and orchestration directly in Python for ultimate flexibility, testability, and version control.
*   **Modular Multi-Agent Systems:** Design scalable applications by composing multiple specialized agents into flexible hierarchies.
*   **Deploy Anywhere:** Easily containerize and deploy agents on Cloud Run or scale seamlessly with Vertex AI Agent Engine.
*   **Built-in Development UI:** Test, evaluate, debug, and showcase your agent(s) with the built-in development UI.
*   **Evaluation Tools:** Evaluate your agent's performance with built-in evaluation tools.

## ü§ñ Agent2Agent (A2A) Protocol Integration

ADK seamlessly integrates with the [A2A protocol](https://github.com/google-a2a/A2A/) for remote agent-to-agent communication.  See the [A2A example](https://github.com/a2aproject/a2a-samples/tree/main/samples/python/agents) to learn more.

## üèÅ Example: Building Agents with ADK

### Define a Single Agent:

```python
from google.adk.agents import Agent
from google.adk.tools import google_search

root_agent = Agent(
    name="search_assistant",
    model="gemini-2.0-flash", # Or your preferred Gemini model
    instruction="You are a helpful assistant. Answer user questions using Google Search when needed.",
    description="An assistant that can search the web.",
    tools=[google_search]
)
```

### Define a Multi-Agent System:

```python
from google.adk.agents import LlmAgent, BaseAgent

# Define individual agents
greeter = LlmAgent(name="greeter", model="gemini-2.0-flash", ...)
task_executor = LlmAgent(name="task_executor", model="gemini-2.0-flash", ...)

# Create parent agent and assign children via sub_agents
coordinator = LlmAgent(
    name="Coordinator",
    model="gemini-2.0-flash",
    description="I coordinate greetings and tasks.",
    sub_agents=[ # Assign sub_agents here
        greeter,
        task_executor
    ]
)
```

### Development UI Example:

###  Evaluate Agents

```bash
adk eval \
    samples_for_testing/hello_world \
    samples_for_testing/hello_world/hello_world_eval_set_001.evalset.json
```
