The Agent Development Kit (ADK) empowers developers to create, evaluate, and deploy sophisticated AI agents with unprecedented flexibility and control. Designed for seamless integration with the Google ecosystem, ADK is also model-agnostic and deployment-agnostic, making it a versatile choice for a wide range of agent development needs.

## Key Features

*   **Code-First Development:** Define agent logic, tools, and orchestrations directly in Python for ultimate flexibility, testability, and versioning.
*   **Rich Tool Ecosystem:** Integrate pre-built tools, custom functions, OpenAPI specifications, and existing tools to equip your agents with diverse capabilities.
*   **Modular Multi-Agent Systems:** Build scalable applications by composing multiple specialized agents into flexible hierarchies.
*   **Deploy Anywhere:** Easily containerize and deploy agents on Cloud Run or scale seamlessly with Vertex AI Agent Engine.
*   **Agent Config:** Build agents without code using the [Agent Config](https://google.github.io/adk-docs/agents/config/) feature.

## ‚ú® What's new

*   **Agent Config:** Build agents without code. Check out the
    [Agent Config](https://google.github.io/adk-docs/agents/config/) feature.

## ü§ñ Agent2Agent (A2A) Protocol Integration

ADK seamlessly integrates with the [A2A protocol](https://github.com/google-a2a/A2A/) for remote agent-to-agent communication.  Explore how A2A and ADK work together in this [example](https://github.com/a2aproject/a2a-samples/tree/main/samples/python/agents).

## üöÄ Installation

### Stable Release (Recommended)

Install the latest stable ADK release using pip:

```bash
pip install google-adk
```

### Development Version

Install the latest development version directly from GitHub:

```bash
pip install git+https://github.com/google/adk-python.git@main
```
**Note:** Use the development version for testing new features or accessing critical fixes before they are officially released.

## üìö Documentation & Resources

*   **[Documentation](https://google.github.io/adk-docs)**: Comprehensive guides on building, evaluating, and deploying agents.
*   **[Samples](https://github.com/google/adk-samples)**
*   **[Java ADK](https://github.com/google/adk-java)**
*   **[ADK Web](https://github.com/google/adk-web)**

## üèÅ Feature Highlights

### Define a single agent:

```python
from google.adk.agents import Agent
from google.adk.tools import google_search

root_agent = Agent(
    name="search_assistant",
    model="gemini-2.0-flash", # Or your preferred Gemini model
    instruction="You are a helpful assistant. Answer user questions using Google Search when needed.",
    description="An assistant that can search the web.",
    tools=[google_search]
)
```

### Define a multi-agent system:

Define a multi-agent system with coordinator agent, greeter agent, and task execution agent. Then ADK engine and the model will guide the agents works together to accomplish the task.

```python
from google.adk.agents import LlmAgent, BaseAgent

# Define individual agents
greeter = LlmAgent(name="greeter", model="gemini-2.0-flash", ...)
task_executor = LlmAgent(name="task_executor", model="gemini-2.0-flash", ...)

# Create parent agent and assign children via sub_agents
coordinator = LlmAgent(
    name="Coordinator",
    model="gemini-2.0-flash",
    description="I coordinate greetings and tasks.",
    sub_agents=[ # Assign sub_agents here
        greeter,
        task_executor
    ]
)
```

### Development UI

A built-in development UI to help you test, evaluate, debug, and showcase your agent(s).

###  Evaluate Agents

```bash
adk eval \
    samples_for_testing/hello_world \
    samples_for_testing/hello_world/hello_world_eval_set_001.evalset.json
```
