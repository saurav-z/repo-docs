ADK is an open-source, code-first Python toolkit designed for building and deploying AI agents.  It's flexible, modular, and designed for tight integration with the Google ecosystem while remaining model-agnostic and deployment-agnostic, allowing for use with other frameworks. ADK makes agent development feel more like software development, simplifying the creation, deployment, and orchestration of agentic architectures.

**Key Features:**

*   **Code-First Development:** Define agent logic, tools, and orchestration directly in Python.
*   **Rich Tool Ecosystem:** Utilize pre-built tools, custom functions, and OpenAPI specs.
*   **Modular Multi-Agent Systems:** Compose specialized agents into flexible hierarchies.
*   **Deploy Anywhere:** Easily containerize and deploy agents on Cloud Run or scale with Vertex AI Agent Engine.
*   **Built-in Development UI:** Test, evaluate, debug, and showcase your agents.
*   **Agent2Agent (A2A) Protocol Integration:** Supports remote agent-to-agent communication via the [A2A protocol](https://github.com/google-a2a/A2A/).

## üöÄ Getting Started

### Installation

#### Stable Release (Recommended)

```bash
pip install google-adk
```

This is the recommended method for most users, providing the most recent official release. Releases are made weekly.

#### Development Version

## üèÅ Feature Highlight

### Define a single agent:

```python
from google.adk.agents import Agent
from google.adk.tools import google_search

root_agent = Agent(
    name="search_assistant",
    model="gemini-2.0-flash", # Or your preferred Gemini model
    instruction="You are a helpful assistant. Answer user questions using Google Search when needed.",
    description="An assistant that can search the web.",
    tools=[google_search]
)
```

### Define a multi-agent system:

```python
from google.adk.agents import LlmAgent, BaseAgent

# Define individual agents
greeter = LlmAgent(name="greeter", model="gemini-2.0-flash", ...)
task_executor = LlmAgent(name="task_executor", model="gemini-2.0-flash", ...)

# Create parent agent and assign children via sub_agents
coordinator = LlmAgent(
    name="Coordinator",
    model="gemini-2.0-flash",
    description="I coordinate greetings and tasks.",
    sub_agents=[ # Assign sub_agents here
        greeter,
        task_executor
    ]
)
```

###  Evaluate Agents

```bash
adk eval \
    samples_for_testing/hello_world \
    samples_for_testing/hello_world/hello_world_eval_set_001.evalset.json
```
