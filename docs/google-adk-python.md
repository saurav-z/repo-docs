Agent Development Kit (ADK) is a flexible and modular framework designed for developing and deploying AI agents. While optimized for Gemini and the Google ecosystem, ADK is model-agnostic, deployment-agnostic, and built for compatibility with other frameworks. ADK makes agent development feel more like software development, simplifying the creation, deployment, and orchestration of agentic architectures.

## Key Features

*   **Rich Tool Ecosystem:** Integrate pre-built tools, custom functions, and OpenAPI specs to equip agents with diverse capabilities, with seamless integration with the Google ecosystem.
*   **Code-First Development:** Define agent logic, tools, and orchestration directly in Python for maximum flexibility, testability, and version control.
*   **Modular Multi-Agent Systems:** Design scalable applications by composing multiple specialized agents into flexible hierarchies.
*   **Deploy Anywhere:** Easily containerize and deploy agents on Cloud Run or scale seamlessly with Vertex AI Agent Engine.
*   **Agent2Agent (A2A) Integration:** Seamlessly integrates with the A2A protocol for remote agent communication.

## üöÄ Installation

### Stable Release (Recommended)

Install the latest stable version using `pip`:

```bash

## üèÅ Feature Highlights

### Define a single agent:

```python
from google.adk.agents import Agent
from google.adk.tools import google_search

root_agent = Agent(
    name="search_assistant",
    model="gemini-2.0-flash", # Or your preferred Gemini model
    instruction="You are a helpful assistant. Answer user questions using Google Search when needed.",
    description="An assistant that can search the web.",
    tools=[google_search]
)
```

### Define a multi-agent system:

Define a multi-agent system with coordinator agent, greeter agent, and task execution agent. Then ADK engine and the model will guide the agents works together to accomplish the task.

```python
from google.adk.agents import LlmAgent, BaseAgent

# Define individual agents
greeter = LlmAgent(name="greeter", model="gemini-2.0-flash", ...)
task_executor = LlmAgent(name="task_executor", model="gemini-2.0-flash", ...)

# Create parent agent and assign children via sub_agents
coordinator = LlmAgent(
    name="Coordinator",
    model="gemini-2.0-flash",
    description="I coordinate greetings and tasks.",
    sub_agents=[ # Assign sub_agents here
        greeter,
        task_executor
    ]
)
```

### Development UI

A built-in development UI to help you test, evaluate, debug, and showcase your agent(s).

### Evaluate Agents

```bash
adk eval \
    samples_for_testing/hello_world \
    samples_for_testing/hello_world/hello_world_eval_set_001.evalset.json
```
