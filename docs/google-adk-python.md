ADK empowers developers to create and manage AI agents with ease, offering a streamlined approach to building complex workflows and agentic architectures.  Designed for flexibility and integration, ADK is optimized for the Google ecosystem but remains model and deployment-agnostic.

## Key Features

*   **Code-First Development:** Define agent logic, tools, and orchestration directly in Python for unparalleled flexibility, testability, and version control.
*   **Rich Tool Ecosystem:** Leverage pre-built tools, custom functions, and OpenAPI specs, plus seamless integration with Google services.
*   **Modular Multi-Agent Systems:** Design scalable applications by composing multiple specialized agents into flexible hierarchies.
*   **Deploy Anywhere:** Easily containerize and deploy agents on Cloud Run or scale seamlessly with Vertex AI Agent Engine.
*   **Agent Config**: Build agents without code. Check out the [Agent Config](https://google.github.io/adk-docs/agents/config/) feature.
*   **Built-in Development UI:** Test, evaluate, debug, and showcase your agent(s) with an integrated user interface.

## ü§ñ Agent2Agent (A2A) Protocol Integration

ADK seamlessly integrates with the [A2A protocol](https://github.com/google-a2a/A2A/) for remote agent-to-agent communication. Explore how they work together in this [example](https://github.com/a2aproject/a2a-samples/tree/main/samples/python/agents).

## üöÄ Getting Started

### Installation

Install the ADK using pip:

```bash
pip install google-adk
```

### Development Version

For the latest features and bug fixes, install directly from the `main` branch:

```bash
pip install git+https://github.com/google/adk-python.git@main
```

**Note:** The development version may contain experimental features or bugs.

## üìö Documentation

Comprehensive documentation is available for in-depth guidance:

*   [ADK Documentation](https://google.github.io/adk-docs)

## üèÅ Example Usage

### Define a Single Agent

```python
from google.adk.agents import Agent
from google.adk.tools import google_search

root_agent = Agent(
    name="search_assistant",
    model="gemini-2.0-flash", # Or your preferred Gemini model
    instruction="You are a helpful assistant. Answer user questions using Google Search when needed.",
    description="An assistant that can search the web.",
    tools=[google_search]
)
```

### Define a Multi-Agent System

```python
from google.adk.agents import LlmAgent, BaseAgent

# Define individual agents
greeter = LlmAgent(name="greeter", model="gemini-2.0-flash", ...)
task_executor = LlmAgent(name="task_executor", model="gemini-2.0-flash", ...)

# Create parent agent and assign children via sub_agents
coordinator = LlmAgent(
    name="Coordinator",
    model="gemini-2.0-flash",
    description="I coordinate greetings and tasks.",
    sub_agents=[ # Assign sub_agents here
        greeter,
        task_executor
    ]
)
```

### Evaluate Agents

```bash
adk eval \
    samples_for_testing/hello_world \
    samples_for_testing/hello_world/hello_world_eval_set_001.evalset.json
```

## Vibe Coding

For agent development via vibe coding the [llms.txt](./llms.txt) and the [llms-full.txt](./llms-full.txt) can be used as context to LLM. While the former one is a summarized one and the later one has the full information in case your LLM has big enough context window.
