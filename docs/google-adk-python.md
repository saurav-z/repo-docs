ADK provides a flexible, modular, and code-first approach to agent development, enabling developers to create, deploy, and orchestrate AI agents for a wide range of applications. While optimized for the Google ecosystem, ADK is designed to be model-agnostic and deployment-agnostic, ensuring compatibility with various frameworks.

**Key Features:**

*   **Code-First Development:** Define agent logic, tools, and orchestration directly in Python, promoting flexibility, testability, and versioning.
*   **Rich Tool Ecosystem:** Integrate pre-built tools, custom functions, and OpenAPI specifications to equip agents with diverse capabilities.
*   **Modular Multi-Agent Systems:** Design scalable applications by composing multiple specialized agents into flexible hierarchies.
*   **Deploy Anywhere:** Easily containerize and deploy agents on Cloud Run or scale seamlessly with Vertex AI Agent Engine.
*   **Built-in Development UI:** Test, evaluate, debug, and showcase your agents using the built-in development UI.
*   **Agent2Agent (A2A) Protocol Integration:** Seamlessly integrate with the A2A protocol for remote agent communication.

## üöÄ Getting Started

### Installation

Choose your preferred installation method:

#### Stable Release (Recommended)

Install the latest stable version of ADK using `pip`:

```bash
pip install google-adk
```

This is the recommended option for most users, providing the most recent official release.

#### Development Version

For access to the latest features and bug fixes (potentially unstable), install directly from the main branch:

```bash
pip install git+https://github.com/google/adk-python.git@main
```

**Note:** Use the development version for testing and accessing critical fixes before official releases.

## üíª Example Usage

### Define a Single Agent:

```python
from google.adk.agents import Agent
from google.adk.tools import google_search

root_agent = Agent(
    name="search_assistant",
    model="gemini-2.0-flash", # Or your preferred Gemini model
    instruction="You are a helpful assistant. Answer user questions using Google Search when needed.",
    description="An assistant that can search the web.",
    tools=[google_search]
)
```

### Define a Multi-Agent System:

Define a multi-agent system with coordinator agent, greeter agent, and task execution agent. Then ADK engine and the model will guide the agents works together to accomplish the task.

```python
from google.adk.agents import LlmAgent, BaseAgent

# Define individual agents
greeter = LlmAgent(name="greeter", model="gemini-2.0-flash", ...)
task_executor = LlmAgent(name="task_executor", model="gemini-2.0-flash", ...)

# Create parent agent and assign children via sub_agents
coordinator = LlmAgent(
    name="Coordinator",
    model="gemini-2.0-flash",
    description="I coordinate greetings and tasks.",
    sub_agents=[ # Assign sub_agents here
        greeter,
        task_executor
    ]
)
```

###  Evaluate Agents

```bash
adk eval \
    samples_for_testing/hello_world \
    samples_for_testing/hello_world/hello_world_eval_set_001.evalset.json
```
