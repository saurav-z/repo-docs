# PerfKit Benchmarker: The Open Source Standard for Cloud Performance Benchmarking

**Ready to compare cloud offerings and optimize your infrastructure?** PerfKit Benchmarker provides a standardized, automated framework for measuring and comparing the performance of various cloud platforms. Explore the original repository: [https://github.com/GoogleCloudPlatform/PerfKitBenchmarker](https://github.com/GoogleCloudPlatform/PerfKitBenchmarker).

## Key Features:

*   **Automated Benchmarking:** Easily run a wide range of popular benchmarks on various cloud providers with minimal user interaction.
*   **Cloud Agnostic:** Supports benchmarking across major cloud providers like Google Cloud, AWS, Azure, and others.
*   **Standardized Results:** Uses consistent settings for benchmarks to ensure fair comparisons across different cloud services.
*   **Flexible Configuration:** Allows for advanced customization with configuration files and overrides for tailored testing.
*   **Extensible:** Easily add new benchmarks, support for additional cloud providers, and custom features.
*   **Licensing Compliance:**  Ensures you accept the licenses of each benchmark before execution, providing transparency and control.

## Getting Started:

1.  **Prerequisites:**

    *   A cloud provider account for each platform you plan to benchmark (AWS, GCP, Azure, etc.).
    *   Python 3.11 or later.
    *   `pip` for managing Python packages.

2.  **Set Up a Virtual Environment:**

    ```bash
    python3 -m venv $HOME/my_virtualenv
    source $HOME/my_virtualenv/bin/activate
    ```

3.  **Install PerfKit Benchmarker:**

    *   Clone the repository:
        ```bash
        git clone https://github.com/GoogleCloudPlatform/PerfKitBenchmarker.git
        ```
    *   Install dependencies:
        ```bash
        cd PerfKitBenchmarker
        pip3 install -r requirements.txt
        ```
        *You may need to install provider-specific requirements. For example:*
        ```bash
        cd perfkitbenchmarker/providers/aws
        pip3 install -r requirements.txt
        ```

4.  **Run a Benchmark:**

    ```bash
    ./pkb.py --cloud=<cloud_provider> --benchmarks=<benchmark_name> --machine_type=<machine_type>
    ```
    *   Replace `<cloud_provider>` (e.g., GCP, AWS, Azure).
    *   Replace `<benchmark_name>` (e.g., iperf, netperf).
    *   Replace `<machine_type>` with the desired instance type.

    *Example: Run iperf on GCP*
    ```bash
    ./pkb.py --project=<GCP project ID> --benchmarks=iperf --machine_type=f1-micro
    ```

## Advanced Usage:

*   **Benchmarking on Windows:** Run Windows benchmarks by using the `--os_type=windows` flag.
*   **Juju Integration:** Leverage Juju for automated deployment and management with the `--os_type=juju` flag.
*   **Preprovisioned Data:** Learn how to upload data to Cloud Storage and configure your benchmarks accordingly.
*   **Configuration Files:** Use YAML configuration files for complex setups and customizations.
*   **Static Machines:** Run benchmarks on local or non-provisioned machines using configuration files to describe the target machines.
*   **Elasticsearch Integration:** Publish your benchmark results to an Elasticsearch server for easy analysis.  Install `elasticsearch`: `pip install elasticsearch`.
*   **InfluxDB Integration:**  Publish your benchmark results to an InfluxDB server.
