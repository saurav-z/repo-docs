# PerfKit Benchmarker: Benchmarking Cloud Offerings with Ease

**Tired of vendor lock-in and unclear cloud performance?**  PerfKit Benchmarker ([original repo](https://github.com/GoogleCloudPlatform/PerfKitBenchmarker)) provides a consistent and automated way to measure and compare the performance of various cloud providers using a standardized set of benchmarks.

## Key Features

*   **Automated Benchmarking:** Simplifies the process of benchmarking by automating VM instantiation, benchmark installation, and workload execution.
*   **Cloud Provider Support:** Works with major cloud providers including GCP, AWS, Azure, and more, allowing for cross-platform comparisons.
*   **Extensive Benchmark Suite:** Offers a comprehensive set of benchmarks, covering various aspects of cloud performance like CPU, disk I/O, networking, and database performance.  Choose from a standard set or custom sets to meet your specific needs.
*   **Flexible Configuration:** Allows customization of benchmark settings and configurations through YAML files and command-line overrides.
*   **Easy to Use:** Provides simple command-line options for running benchmarks with minimal user interaction.
*   **Open Source & Extensible:**  An open-source project enabling community contributions and customization of the benchmark suite.
*   **Data Publication:** Publishes results to popular services like Elasticsearch and InfluxDB for analysis and visualization.

## Getting Started

### Installation

1.  **Set up Python 3 and a virtual environment:**
    ```bash
    python3 -m venv $HOME/my_virtualenv
    source $HOME/my_virtualenv/bin/activate
    ```
2.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/GoogleCloudPlatform/PerfKitBenchmarker.git
    ```
3.  **Install dependencies:**
    ```bash
    pip3 install -r $HOME/PerfKitBenchmarker/requirements.txt
    ```
    (Install provider-specific requirements as needed - see original README for details).

### Running a Simple Benchmark

Here's a quick example for running the `iperf` benchmark on GCP:

```bash
./pkb.py --project=<GCP project ID> --benchmarks=iperf --machine_type=f1-micro
```

Refer to the [original README](https://github.com/GoogleCloudPlatform/PerfKitBenchmarker) for details on running benchmarks on other cloud providers, additional flags, and advanced usage.

## Licensing and Benchmark Details
