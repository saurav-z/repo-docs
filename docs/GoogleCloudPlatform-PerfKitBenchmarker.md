## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

*   A valid account on the cloud provider you wish to benchmark (e.g., GCP, AWS, Azure).
*   Python 3.11+ and pip (Python package installer).
*   Dependencies - Install necessary packages:
    ```bash
    python3 -m venv $HOME/my_virtualenv
    source $HOME/my_virtualenv/bin/activate
    pip3 install -r $HOME/PerfKitBenchmarker/requirements.txt
    ```

### Installation

1.  Clone the repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/GoogleCloudPlatform/PerfKitBenchmarker.git
    cd PerfKitBenchmarker
    ```

2.  Install provider-specific dependencies (e.g., for AWS):
    ```bash
    cd perfkitbenchmarker/providers/aws
    pip3 install -r requirements.txt
    ```

### Running a Benchmark

Here are a few examples:
*   **On GCP:**
    ```bash
    ./pkb.py --project=<GCP project ID> --benchmarks=iperf --machine_type=f1-micro
    ```
*   **On AWS:**
    ```bash
    ./pkb.py --cloud=AWS --benchmarks=iperf --machine_type=t2.micro
    ```
*   **On Azure:**
    ```bash
    ./pkb.py --cloud=Azure --machine_type=Standard_A0 --benchmarks=iperf
    ```
*   **See the full range of options in the original README.**
