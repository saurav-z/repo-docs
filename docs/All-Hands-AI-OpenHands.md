## ☁️ OpenHands Cloud

The easiest way to get started with OpenHands is on [OpenHands Cloud](https://app.all-hands.dev), which comes with $20 in free credits for new users.

## 💻 Running OpenHands Locally

### Option 1: CLI Launcher (Recommended)

The recommended way to run OpenHands locally is using the CLI launcher with [uv](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/). This provides better isolation from your current project's virtual environment and is required for OpenHands' default MCP servers.

**Install uv** (if you haven't already):

See the [uv installation guide](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/getting-started/installation/) for the latest installation instructions for your platform.

**Launch OpenHands**:
```bash
# Launch the GUI server
uvx --python 3.12 --from openhands-ai openhands serve

# Or launch the CLI
uvx --python 3.12 --from openhands-ai openhands
```

You'll find OpenHands running at [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) (for GUI mode)!

### Option 2: Docker

<details>
<summary>Click to expand Docker command</summary>

You can also run OpenHands directly with Docker:

```bash
docker pull docker.all-hands.dev/all-hands-ai/runtime:0.56-nikolaik

docker run -it --rm --pull=always \
    -e SANDBOX_RUNTIME_CONTAINER_IMAGE=docker.all-hands.dev/all-hands-ai/runtime:0.56-nikolaik \
    -e LOG_ALL_EVENTS=true \
    -v /var/run/docker.sock:/var/run/docker.sock \
    -v ~/.openhands:/.openhands \
    -p 3000:3000 \
    --add-host host.docker.internal:host-gateway \
    --name openhands-app \
    docker.all-hands.dev/all-hands-ai/openhands:0.56
```

</details>

> **Note**: If you used OpenHands before version 0.44, you may want to run `mv ~/.openhands-state ~/.openhands` to migrate your conversation history to the new location.

> [!WARNING]
> On a public network? See our [Hardened Docker Installation Guide](https://docs.all-hands.dev/usage/runtimes/docker#hardened-docker-installation)
> to secure your deployment by restricting network binding and implementing additional security measures.

### Getting Started

When you open the application, you'll be asked to choose an LLM provider and add an API key.
[Anthropic's Claude Sonnet 4](https://www.anthropic.com/api) (`anthropic/claude-sonnet-4-20250514`)
works best, but you have [many options](https://docs.all-hands.dev/usage/llms).

See the [Running OpenHands](https://docs.all-hands.dev/usage/installation) guide for
system requirements and more information.

## 💡 Other Ways to Run OpenHands

> [!WARNING]
> OpenHands is meant to be run by a single user on their local workstation.
> It is not appropriate for multi-tenant deployments where multiple users share the same instance. There is no built-in authentication, isolation, or scalability.
>
> If you're interested in running OpenHands in a multi-tenant environment, check out the source-available, commercially-licensed
> [OpenHands Cloud Helm Chart](https://github.com/all-Hands-AI/OpenHands-cloud)

You can:

*   [Connect OpenHands to your local filesystem](https://docs.all-hands.dev/usage/runtimes/docker#connecting-to-your-filesystem).
*   Interact with it via a [friendly CLI](https://docs.all-hands.dev/usage/how-to/cli-mode).
*   Run OpenHands in a scriptable [headless mode](https://docs.all-hands.dev/usage/how-to/headless-mode).
*   Run it on tagged issues with [a github action](https://docs.all-hands.dev/usage/how-to/github-action).

Visit [Running OpenHands](https://docs.all-hands.dev/usage/installation) for more information and setup instructions.
