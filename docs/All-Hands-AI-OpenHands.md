## ‚òÅÔ∏è OpenHands Cloud

The easiest way to start using OpenHands is on [OpenHands Cloud](https://app.all-hands.dev), with $20 in free credits for new users.

## üíª Running OpenHands Locally

### Option 1: CLI Launcher (Recommended)

The most straightforward method to run OpenHands locally is with the CLI launcher and [uv](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/).  This provides superior isolation from your project's virtual environment and is essential for OpenHands' default MCP servers.

**Install uv** (if you haven't already):

Refer to the [uv installation guide](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/getting-started/installation/) for the most up-to-date installation instructions for your platform.

**Launch OpenHands**:

```bash
# Launch the GUI server
uvx --python 3.12 --from openhands-ai openhands serve

# Or launch the CLI
uvx --python 3.12 --from openhands-ai openhands
```

Find OpenHands running at [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) (for GUI mode)!

### Option 2: Docker

<details>
<summary>Click to expand Docker command</summary>

Alternatively, run OpenHands with Docker:

```bash
docker pull docker.all-hands.dev/all-hands-ai/runtime:0.57-nikolaik

docker run -it --rm --pull=always \
    -e SANDBOX_RUNTIME_CONTAINER_IMAGE=docker.all-hands.dev/all-hands-ai/runtime:0.57-nikolaik \
    -e LOG_ALL_EVENTS=true \
    -v /var/run/docker.sock:/var/run/docker.sock \
    -v ~/.openhands:/.openhands \
    -p 3000:3000 \
    --add-host host.docker.internal:host-gateway \
    --name openhands-app \
    docker.all-hands.dev/all-hands-ai/openhands:0.57
```

</details>

> **Note**: If you used OpenHands before version 0.44, run `mv ~/.openhands-state ~/.openhands` to migrate your conversation history.

> [!WARNING]
> On a public network? Secure your deployment by following the [Hardened Docker Installation Guide](https://docs.all-hands.dev/usage/runtimes/docker#hardened-docker-installation).

### Configuration

When you launch the application, you'll be prompted to choose an LLM provider and add an API key. [Anthropic's Claude Sonnet 4](https://www.anthropic.com/api) (`anthropic/claude-sonnet-4-20250514`) is recommended, but multiple [LLM options](https://docs.all-hands.dev/usage/llms) are available.

Consult the [Running OpenHands](https://docs.all-hands.dev/usage/installation) guide for comprehensive details and system requirements.

## üí° Other Ways to Run OpenHands

> [!WARNING]
> OpenHands is designed for single-user local workstation environments.  It is unsuitable for multi-tenant deployments lacking built-in authentication, isolation, or scalability.
>
> For multi-tenant environments, consider the source-available, commercially-licensed [OpenHands Cloud Helm Chart](https://github.com/all-Hands-AI/OpenHands-cloud).

You can connect OpenHands to your local filesystem ([connecting to your filesystem](https://docs.all-hands.dev/usage/runtimes/docker#connecting-to-your-filesystem)), interact with it via a friendly CLI ([CLI mode](https://docs.all-hands.dev/usage/how-to/cli-mode)), run OpenHands in a scriptable headless mode ([headless mode](https://docs.all-hands.dev/usage/how-to/headless-mode)), or on tagged issues with a GitHub action ([GitHub action](https://docs.all-hands.dev/usage/how-to/github-action)).

Visit [Running OpenHands](https://docs.all-hands.dev/usage/installation) for more information and instructions.
