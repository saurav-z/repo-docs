*   **AI Tools:** Use ChatGPT, Claude, Gemini, GitHub, and OpenAI API.
*   **E-commerce:** Manage Amazon, eBay, and Shopify.
*   **Gaming:** Access PSN, Switch, and Steam servers with low latency.
*   **Digital Life:** Access US Apple ID and Google Play accounts, and subscribe to low-cost services like iCloud+ and YouTube Premium.
