## ✈️ What is an "Airport"? Principle & Benefits

"Airport" in the context of this guide refers to a service that utilizes encryption protocols like **Shadowsocks, V2Ray, and Trojan** to bypass internet censorship.  These services, often accessed via a **subscription URL**, provide multi-node access, offering superior flexibility and stability compared to traditional VPNs.

Key characteristics of Airport services:

*   ⛓️ **Multiple Entry Points:** Includes direct connect, CN2, and transit lines.
*   🌉 **Various Transit Technologies:** IEPL private lines, BGP networks, and encrypted tunnels.
*   🌍 **Global Node Distribution:**  Access to nodes worldwide, featuring native IPs, home broadband, and cloud provider IPs.

**Typical Uses:**

| ✅ Application Areas          | 🌐 Unlocking Capabilities                                                                                                                  |
| :--------------------------- | :------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Content & Entertainment** | Access **Netflix, Disney+, YouTube 4K HDR, Spotify, Prime Video, NBA League Pass**, and other restricted platforms.                                           |
| **AI Tools & Remote Work**  |  Use **ChatGPT, Claude, Gemini, Hugging Face, Notion AI**, and access **GitHub, Docker Hub, OpenAI API**.                                            |
| **Cross-Border E-commerce** | Manage **Amazon, eBay, Shopify** stores, run **Google/Facebook ads**, and sync **ERP systems**.                                                |
| **International Game Acceleration** | Connect to **PSN, Switch, Steam** servers worldwide with low latency; switch to **Argentina, Turkey** for lower-priced content.                      |
| **Digital Life Expansion** | Register US **Apple ID** or **Google Play** accounts, purchase gift cards, and subscribe to **iCloud+, YouTube Premium, Spotify Family Plan** at lower prices. |

>  In essence, an "airport" is a solution that combines **multi-node scheduling, intelligent traffic routing, and global acceleration**, offering greater flexibility than a VPN and better stability than traditional proxies.  It is an excellent choice for accessing **ChatGPT, YouTube, and Netflix** in 2025.

## ❓Choosing the Right Airport: The Ultimate Selection Guide

### 🧱 Network Architecture Priority

**IEPL / IPLC > BGP Transit > General Transit > Public Direct Connect**

*   Dedicated Lines (IEPL/IPLC): Low latency, minimal packet loss; ideal for high-frequency users and gamers.
*   Transit Lines: Good performance, but stability depends on node scheduling.
*   Public Direct Connect: Most susceptible to speed throttling or blocking; use with caution.

### 🚀 Bandwidth and Peak Performance

Choose providers with **public bandwidth information and peak speed testing**:

*   Multiple Gigabit dedicated lines > Single GIA / CN2.
*   Testing during peak hours is crucial.
*   Inadequate peak-hour capacity will severely impact user experience.

### 🌍 IP Location and Unlocking Capabilities

*   For Netflix, ChatGPT, TikTok, use **native IP / home broadband IP**.
*   Avoid Chinese ASN (e.g., 4134/4837), or you might get account bans and verification failures.
*   Good airports will list node regions, unlocking capabilities, and IP types.

### ⭐ Brand Reputation and Operational Experience

*   Prioritize stable, 1+ year old airports with active communities and speed test records.
*   Look for official speed test pages, Telegram groups, and automated ticketing systems.
*   Beware of new or anonymous providers; the risk of closure is very high.

### 💰 Package Flexibility and Payment Methods

*   Support **monthly / traffic package / USDT / Alipay** to avoid annual payment traps.
*   Consider device connection limits, traffic reset cycles, and shared account support.
*   Some airports offer trial periods or refunds, good for testing.

### ⚠️ Risk Reminder: Avoid Free & Low-Cost Airports

*   ❌ **Free Airports** often carry the following risks:
    *   **Severe speed limits, frequent disconnections, and bandwidth abuse.**
    *   Injection of ads, tracking, or even monitoring by the operator.
    *   **No guarantee of privacy or security**, especially unsuitable for sensitive activities.

*   ❌ Ultra-low cost airports (e.g., 9.9 yuan per year) may result in:
    *   **Long-term IP contamination, unable to access external networks.**
    *   Service crashes and traffic congestion due to sudden user growth.
    *   Temporary websites and one-click platforms; no protection if they shut down.

>   ✅ **Recommended Strategy:** Pair a stable main airport with a backup airport (transit/dedicated line traffic package) to ensure continuous access at critical times.

## ✈️ Airport vs. VPN: Which is Best?

| Feature          | VPN                                   | Airport                                       |
| :--------------- | :------------------------------------ | :-------------------------------------------- |
| **Connection**   | One-click global, (restricted in China)        | Subscription import -> Policy groups -> Traffic separation |
| **Node Count**   | 3‑10 Mainstream exits             | 30‑200+ global lines                             |
| **Flexibility**  | Global / Per-app (limited support)        | Domain / Port / IP separation, rule customization, proxy chains |
| **Speed Limit**  | Limited by single machine bandwidth, user count | Depends on the airport's total bandwidth and line quality |
| **Price Range**  | 2‑12 USD/month                        | 5‑120 CNY/month (wide range)                   |
| **Protocol**     | OpenVPN / WireGuard, etc.            | SS / Vmess / Trojan, can be mixed            |
| **Unlocking**    | Netflix (some); ChatGPT (depends on policy) | Airports usually optimized for streaming + AI, high unlock rates |

**🔍 Key Comparative Conclusions**

*   **VPN:** Higher latency, high security, lower speeds due to encryption (and the blocks in China.)  Cheaper long-term.
*   **Airports:** Higher flexibility for users to choose speed, price, and node count. Low latency, fast speeds.  Great choice for high-quality internet access for developers, gamers, and streamers.

### 8. What software do I need to install?

Common software includes Clash for Windows, Clash Verge, V2rayN, Shadowrocket (iOS), Stash (iOS), ClashMeta for Android, etc.

---

### 9. Are airports fast? Will they lag?

Depends on the lines, bandwidth, and peak-hour performance of the airport. Choose service providers with IEPL dedicated lines or CN2 GIA for better speed and stability.

---

### 10. How do I prevent airport runaways?

Choose service providers with websites, public speed tests, and active TG groups. Recommend monthly or quarterly payments and avoid annual payments to new airports.
