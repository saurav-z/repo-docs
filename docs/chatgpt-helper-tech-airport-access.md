## ✈️ What is an "Airport"? The Principles and Functions of Internet Access (2025 Edition)

In the Chinese internet context, an **"airport"** commonly refers to services that use encryption protocols like **Shadowsocks, V2Ray, and Trojan** to help users bypass the Great Firewall. Through a **subscription link (Subscription URL)**, users can get nodes from multiple countries with one-click setup, allowing them to break through firewalls more steadily and flexibly, and enjoy global internet content.

Compared with traditional VPNs' single-route operation, airport services focus on **multiple nodes and smart traffic routing**. Common features include:

*   ⛓️ Various **entry links** (such as direct connections, CN2 dedicated lines, and tunnel relays)
*   🌉 Various **transit technologies** (IEPL intranet dedicated lines, BGP high-defense networks, and encrypted tunnels)
*   🌍 Globally distributed **landing nodes** (including native IPs, home broadband, and cloud service provider IPs)

---

<a id="choose"></a>

## ❓ How to Choose a Reliable Airport Service Provider?

### 🧱 Network Architecture Priority
**IEPL / IPLC Dedicated Lines > BGP Transit > Ordinary Transit > Public Network Direct Connection**
*   Dedicated Lines (IEPL/IPLC): Low latency, few packet losses, not easily blocked, suitable for high-frequency users and gamers.
*   Transit Lines: Better experience, but stability is affected by node scheduling.
*   Public Network Direct Connection: Easiest to be throttled or blocked, choose cautiously.

### 🚀 Bandwidth and Peak Experience
Choose service providers that **disclose bandwidth information and support peak speed tests**:
*   Multiple Gigabit Dedicated Lines > Single GIA / CN2
*   Whether peak-hour speed tests are supported is a core indicator.
*   User experience will severely decline if peak-hour capacity is not expanded.

### 🌍 IP Landing and Unlocking Capabilities
*   For services like Netflix, ChatGPT, TikTok, etc., it is recommended to use **native IPs / home broadband IPs**.
*   Avoid IP landing with Chinese ASNs (such as 4134/4837, etc.), otherwise, account suspension and verification failure may occur.
*   Excellent airports will indicate the region, unlocking capabilities, and IP type of each node.

### ⭐ Brand Reputation and Operational Experience
*   Prioritize **well-established airports with stable operation for over 1 year, active communities, and speed test records**.
*   Pay attention to whether there are official speed test pages, Telegram groups, and automated ticket systems for support.
*   Beware of new sites and anonymous airports without a leader, the risk of running away is extremely high.

### 💰 Package Flexibility and Payment Methods
*   Support **monthly payment / traffic packages / USDT / Alipay** and other methods, avoid annual payment traps.
*   Pay attention to whether there are device connection number restrictions, traffic cycle resets, support for shared accounts, and other details.
*   Some airports support trial use or limited-time refunds, suitable for new users to test and experience.

---

### ⚠️ Risk Reminder: Stay Away from Free and Extremely Low-Priced Airports

*   ❌ Free airports usually **have the following risks**:
    *   **Severe throttling, frequent disconnections, bandwidth abuse**
    *   Being used by the operators **to inject ads, track, and even monitor**
    *   **Privacy and security are not guaranteed**, especially not recommended for sensitive operations (such as securely logging into financial accounts)

*   ❌ Extremely low-priced airports (such as 9.9 yuan per year) have:
    *   **Long-term IP pollution cannot access the external network**
    *   User surge results in **service crashes, traffic grabbing**
    *   Temporary websites, one-click build platforms, once they run away, there is no guarantee of rights protection

>   ✅ **Recommended Strategy**: Use a stable main airport along with a backup airport (you can choose a transit/dedicated line package with traffic packages), to ensure that you do not lose connectivity during critical moments.
