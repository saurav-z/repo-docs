## 🚀 Quick Start

```bash
# Install Omnara (requires python >= 3.10)
pip install omnara

# Start a Claude Code session that's synced between terminal, web, and mobile
omnara

# Start a Codex CLI session that's synced between terminal, web, and mobile
omnara --agent codex
```

That's it! Create an account when prompted, then return to your terminal to interact with your coding agent. You can now see and interact with your coding agent session from the [web dashboard](https://omnara.com/dashboard) or the [mobile app](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/omnara-ai-command-center/id6748426727).

## 💡 What is Omnara?

Omnara transforms your AI agents (Claude Code, Codex CLI, n8n, and more) from silent workers into communicative teammates. Get real-time visibility into what your agents are doing, and respond to their questions instantly from a single dashboard on web and mobile.

## 📖 How to Use

### 1. Omnara CLI
<details>
<summary>The primary way to use CLI coding agents (Claude Code, Codex CLI) with Omnara</summary>

#### Installation

Install Omnara using your preferred package manager:

```bash
# Using pip
pip install omnara

# Using uv
uv tool install omnara

# Using pipx
pipx install omnara
```

#### Running Omnara

Omnara offers three different modes depending on your workflow:

##### **Standard Mode** - Full Claude Code/Codex CLI Experience
```bash
omnara
```
Starts Claude Code with the standard CLI interface, fully synced across terminal, web dashboard, and mobile app. You interact with Claude Code in your terminal as usual, while everything is mirrored to the Omnara dashboard.

```bash
omnara --agent codex
```
Starts Codex with the standard CLI interface with the same features as noted above

##### **Headless Mode** - Dashboard-Only Interaction
```bash
omnara headless
```
Runs Claude Code in the background without the terminal UI. Perfect for when you want to interact with Claude Code exclusively through the Omnara web dashboard or mobile app.

##### **Server Mode** - Remote Launch Capability
```bash
omnara serve
```
Exposes an endpoint that allows you to launch Claude Code instances remotely from the Omnara dashboard. Ideal for triggering AI agents from your phone or another device.

#### Upgrading

Keep Omnara up-to-date with the latest features:

```bash
# Using pip
pip install omnara --upgrade

# Using uv
uv tool upgrade omnara

# Using pipx
pipx upgrade omnara
```

</details>

### 2. n8n Integration
<details>
<summary>Add human-in-the-loop capabilities to your n8n workflows</summary>

#### What it Does

The Omnara n8n integration provides a specialized "Human in the Loop" node that enables real-time human-AI collaboration within your n8n workflows. Perfect for approval workflows, agent conversations, and guided automation.


#### Installation & Setup

For detailed installation and configuration instructions, see the [n8n-nodes-omnara package](https://www.npmjs.com/package/n8n-nodes-omnara) on npm.

</details>

### 3. GitHub Actions Integration
<details>
<summary>Run Claude Code in GitHub Actions with Omnara monitoring</summary>

#### What it Does

The Omnara GitHub Actions integration allows you to trigger Claude Code to run in your GitHub Actions workflows via repository dispatch events, while monitoring and interacting with it through the Omnara dashboard.

#### Key Features

- **Remote Launch**: Start GitHub Actions from your phone or web dashboard
- **Automatic PR Creation**: Claude creates branches, commits changes, and opens PRs
- **Real-time Monitoring**: Track progress and provide guidance through Omnara

#### Installation & Setup

For complete setup instructions including GitHub workflow configuration, see the [GitHub Actions integration guide](./integrations/github/claude-code-action/README.md).

## 🔧 Integrating your own Agent into Omnara


### Method 1: Manual MCP Configuration

For custom MCP setups, you can configure manually:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "omnara": {
      "command": "pipx",
      "args": ["run", "--no-cache", "omnara", "mcp", "--api-key", "YOUR_API_KEY"]
    }
  }
}
```

### Method 2: Python SDK
```python
from omnara import OmnaraClient
import uuid

client = OmnaraClient(api_key="your-api-key")
instance_id = str(uuid.uuid4())

# Log progress and check for user feedback
response = client.send_message(
    agent_type="claude-code",
    content="Analyzing codebase structure",
    agent_instance_id=instance_id,
    requires_user_input=False
)

# Ask for user input when needed
answer = client.send_message(
    content="Should I refactor this legacy module?",
    agent_instance_id=instance_id,
    requires_user_input=True
)
```

### Method 3: REST API
```bash
curl -X POST https://agent.omnara.com/api/v1/messages/agent \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_API_KEY" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"content": "Starting deployment process", "agent_type": "claude-code", "requires_user_input": false}'
```
