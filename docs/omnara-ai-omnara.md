## 🔧 Advanced Usage

> **Note:** The `omnara` and `omnara serve` commands are the easiest ways to use Omnara. These advanced methods are for custom integrations.

### Method 1: Direct Wrapper Script

Run the monitoring wrapper directly:

```bash
# Basic usage
python -m webhooks.claude_wrapper_v3 --api-key YOUR_API_KEY

# With git diff tracking
python -m webhooks.claude_wrapper_v3 --api-key YOUR_API_KEY --git-diff

# Custom API endpoint (for self-hosted)
python -m webhooks.claude_wrapper_v3 --api-key YOUR_API_KEY --base-url https://your-server.com
```

### Method 2: Manual MCP Configuration

For custom MCP setups:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "omnara": {
      "command": "pipx",
      "args": ["run", "--no-cache", "omnara", "mcp", "--api-key", "YOUR_API_KEY"]
    }
  }
}
```

### Method 3: Python SDK

```python
from omnara import OmnaraClient
import uuid

client = OmnaraClient(api_key="your-api-key")
instance_id = str(uuid.uuid4())

# Log progress and check for user feedback
response = client.send_message(
    agent_type="claude-code",
    content="Analyzing codebase structure",
    agent_instance_id=instance_id,
    requires_user_input=False
)

# Ask for user input when needed
answer = client.send_message(
    content="Should I refactor this legacy module?",
    agent_instance_id=instance_id,
    requires_user_input=True
)
```

### Method 4: REST API

```bash
curl -X POST https://api.omnara.ai/api/v1/messages/agent \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_API_KEY" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"content": "Starting deployment process", "agent_type": "claude-code", "requires_user_input": false}'
