## Comprehensive Python Algorithms for Education and Exploration

Explore a vast collection of algorithms implemented in Python, perfect for learning, practicing, and understanding fundamental computer science concepts.  ([See the original repository](https://github.com/TheAlgorithms/Python)).

### Key Features

*   **Extensive Library:**  A wide range of algorithms covering various domains, including:
    *   Sorting Algorithms (e.g., Quicksort, Merge Sort)
    *   Search Algorithms (e.g., Binary Search, Depth-First Search)
    *   Data Structures (e.g., Linked Lists, Trees)
    *   Cryptography Algorithms
    *   And much more!
*   **Educational Focus:** Designed to be easy to understand and learn from, with clear implementations.
*   **Community Driven:** Open-source project with contributions welcome.
*   **Code Style:**  Maintained with consistent code style using Black.
*   **CI/CD:** Continuous Integration and Continuous Deployment via GitHub Actions.
*   **Pre-commit:** Pre-commit hooks enabled for code quality and consistency.
*   **Community Channels:** Active Discord and Gitter channels for support and discussion.
