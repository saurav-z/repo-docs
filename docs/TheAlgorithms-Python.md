# The Algorithms - Python: Learn Algorithms with Python Implementations

This repository, [The Algorithms - Python](https://github.com/TheAlgorithms/Python), is your go-to resource for learning and understanding fundamental algorithms implemented in Python.

## Key Features:

*   **Comprehensive Algorithm Implementations:** Explore a wide range of algorithms across various categories.
*   **Educational Resource:**  Perfect for learning and understanding algorithms through practical Python code.
*   **Community Driven:**  Benefit from a collaborative environment with active community channels for support and discussion.
*   **Well-Organized:** Easy navigation through the [directory](DIRECTORY.md) for algorithm discovery.
*   **Contribution Welcome:**  Contribute and help improve the implementations!
*   **Continuous Integration:**  Automated checks ensure code quality.
*   **Pre-commit enabled:** Enforces code style.

## Important Note:

These implementations are primarily for educational purposes.  They may not always be as optimized as the algorithms found in Python's standard library.  Please use them at your discretion.
