## Explore Algorithms in Python

This repository, [The Algorithms - Python](https://github.com/TheAlgorithms/Python), offers a comprehensive collection of algorithms implemented in Python, perfect for learning and educational purposes.

**Key Features:**

*   **Extensive Algorithm Library:**  Explore a wide range of algorithms across various categories, including sorting, searching, graph theory, and more.
*   **Educational Resource:** Ideal for students, developers, and anyone interested in understanding and implementing algorithms.
*   **Open Source and Collaborative:**  Contributions are welcome! Help expand and improve the collection.
*   **Community Support:** Engage with other learners and contributors on [Discord](https://the-algorithms.com/discord) and [Gitter](https://gitter.im/TheAlgorithms/community).
*   **Code Style:** Adheres to the `black` code style for consistent and readable code.

**Important Note:**

The implementations in this repository are primarily for educational purposes.  They may not always be the most performant compared to optimized implementations found in the Python standard library.  Use them at your own discretion.
