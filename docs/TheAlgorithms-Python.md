## Master Algorithms in Python for Education

This repository, **The Algorithms - Python**, offers a comprehensive collection of algorithms implemented in Python, perfect for learning and understanding fundamental computer science concepts.  Dive into practical implementations for educational purposes and expand your knowledge.  Check out the [original repo](https://github.com/TheAlgorithms/Python) for the full codebase!

**Key Features:**

*   üìö **Educational Focus:** Learn algorithms through practical Python implementations.
*   ü§ù **Community-Driven:**  Contribute to a growing collection of algorithms and solutions.
*   üíª **Ready-to-Code:**  Utilize Gitpod for a seamless coding experience.
*   üí¨ **Active Community:**  Connect with other learners and contributors on Discord and Gitter.
*   ‚úÖ **Continuous Integration:** Automated builds ensure code quality.
*   üõ†Ô∏è **Code Style Compliance:**  Follows best practices for readability and maintainability using Ruff.

**Important Note:**

These implementations are primarily for educational purposes. While they aim for clarity, they may not always be as optimized as the algorithms found in the Python standard library. Use them as a learning tool and adapt them as needed for your specific requirements.
