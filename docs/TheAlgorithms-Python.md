### Key Features:

*   **Extensive Algorithm Coverage:** Implementations covering a wide range of algorithms, including sorting, searching, graph algorithms, and more.
*   **Educational Focus:** Primarily designed for learning and understanding algorithm principles.
*   **Clear and Concise Code:** Well-documented code examples that are easy to follow and understand.
*   **Community-Driven:**  Contributions are welcome! (See our [Contribution Guidelines](CONTRIBUTING.md))
*   **Active Community:**  Connect with other learners and contributors on [Discord](https://the-algorithms.com/discord) and [Gitter](https://gitter.im/TheAlgorithms/community).
*   **Gitpod Ready:** Ready to code with [Gitpod](https://gitpod.io/#https://github.com/TheAlgorithms/Python).
*   **Automated checks**: [CI](https://github.com/TheAlgorithms/Python/actions) and [pre-commit](https://github.com/pre-commit/pre-commit) enabled.
*   **Code Style:**  Uses [ruff](https://docs.astral.sh/ruff/formatter/) for code style.

### Important Notes:

*   Implementations are for educational purposes and may not be as optimized as those in the Python standard library.
*   Use the algorithms at your own discretion.
