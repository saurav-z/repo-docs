### Getting Started with PostHog

#### PostHog Cloud (Recommended)

The fastest and easiest way to get started is by signing up for a free account on [PostHog Cloud](https://us.posthog.com/signup) or [PostHog Cloud EU](https://eu.posthog.com/signup). Enjoy a generous free tier that includes 1 million events, 5k recordings, 1M flag requests, 100k exceptions, and 1500 survey responses per month.

#### Self-hosting the open-source hobby deploy (Advanced)

For self-hosting, deploy a hobby instance on Linux with Docker (4GB memory recommended) using this command:

```bash
/bin/bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/posthog/posthog/HEAD/bin/deploy-hobby)"
```

Self-hosted deployments are suitable for around 100k events per month. For higher volumes, migrating to [PostHog Cloud](https://posthog.com/docs/migrate/migrate-to-cloud) is recommended.

Note: Open-source deployments do not come with customer support or guarantees.  Refer to the [self-hosting docs](https://posthog.com/docs/self-host), [troubleshooting guide](https://posthog.com/docs/self-host/deploy/troubleshooting), and [disclaimer](https://posthog.com/docs/self-host/open-source/disclaimer) for more details.
