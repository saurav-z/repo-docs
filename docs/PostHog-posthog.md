## Getting Started

### PostHog Cloud (Recommended)

The fastest and most reliable way to get started is by signing up for [PostHog Cloud US](https://us.posthog.com/signup) or [PostHog Cloud EU](https://eu.posthog.com/signup). Your first 1 million events, 5k recordings, 1M flag requests, 100k exceptions, and 1500 survey responses are free every month, with usage-based pricing thereafter.

### Self-hosting (Advanced)

For self-hosting, deploy a hobby instance with Docker (Linux, 4GB memory recommended):

```bash
/bin/bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/posthog/posthog/HEAD/bin/deploy-hobby)"
```

Open-source deployments are recommended up to approximately 100k events per month. For larger volumes, we recommend [migrating to PostHog Cloud](https://posthog.com/docs/migrate/migrate-to-cloud). Please see the [self-hosting docs](https://posthog.com/docs/self-host), [troubleshooting guide](https://posthog.com/docs/self-host/deploy/troubleshooting), and [disclaimer](https://posthog.com/docs/self-host/open-source/disclaimer) for more info.
