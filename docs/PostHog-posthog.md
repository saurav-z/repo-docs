## Getting Started with PostHog

### PostHog Cloud (Recommended)

Free tier includes up to 1 million events, 5k recordings, 1M flag requests, 100k exceptions, and 250 survey responses per month.

```

Open-source deployments should scale to approximately 100k events per month. For more, migrate to [PostHog Cloud](https://posthog.com/docs/migrate/migrate-to-cloud).
