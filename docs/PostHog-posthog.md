## Getting started with PostHog

### PostHog Cloud (Recommended)

The easiest and most reliable way to get started is by signing up for free to [PostHog Cloud](https://us.posthog.com/signup) or [PostHog Cloud EU](https://eu.posthog.com/signup). Your first 1 million events, 5k recordings, 1M flag requests, 100k exceptions, and 1500 survey responses are free every month, after which you pay based on usage.

### Self-hosting the open-source hobby deploy (Advanced)

If you want to self-host PostHog, you can deploy a hobby instance in one line on Linux with Docker (recommended 4GB memory):

```bash
/bin/bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/posthog/posthog/HEAD/bin/deploy-hobby)"
```

Open source deployments should scale to approximately 100k events per month, after which we recommend [migrating to a PostHog Cloud](https://posthog.com/docs/migrate/migrate-to-cloud).

We _do not_ provide customer support or offer guarantees for open source deployments. See our [self-hosting docs](https://posthog.com/docs/self-host), [troubleshooting guide](https://posthog.com/docs/self-host/deploy/troubleshooting), and [disclaimer](https://posthog.com/docs/self-host/open-source/disclaimer) for more info.
