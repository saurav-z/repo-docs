*   **Surveys:** Gather user feedback with no-code survey templates.
*   **Data Warehouse:** Integrate data from external tools for comprehensive analysis.

## Getting Started with PostHog

### PostHog Cloud (Recommended)

The easiest way to get started is by signing up for a free [PostHog Cloud](https://us.posthog.com/signup) or [PostHog Cloud EU](https://eu.posthog.com/signup) account. You get a generous free tier with your first million events, 5k recordings, 1M flag requests, 100k exceptions, and 250 survey responses free each month!

### Self-hosting the Open-Source Hobby Deploy (Advanced)

For self-hosting, deploy a hobby instance with Docker (4GB memory recommended) using this one-line command:

```bash
/bin/bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/posthog/posthog/HEAD/bin/deploy-hobby)"
```

Self-hosted deployments are suggested to scale up to approximately 100k events per month.  We recommend [migrating to PostHog Cloud](https://posthog.com/docs/migrate/migrate-to-cloud) for larger scales.

**Important:** Open source deployments do not offer customer support or guarantees. See the [self-hosting docs](https://posthog.com/docs/self-host), [troubleshooting guide](https://posthog.com/docs/self-host/deploy/troubleshooting), and [disclaimer](https://posthog.com/docs/self-host/open-source/disclaimer) for more details.
