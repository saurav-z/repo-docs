## Getting Started with PostHog

### PostHog Cloud (Recommended)

The fastest and easiest way to get started is by signing up for a free account on [PostHog Cloud](https://us.posthog.com/signup) or [PostHog Cloud EU](https://eu.posthog.com/signup). Your first 1 million events, 5k recordings, 1M flag requests, 100k exceptions, and 1500 survey responses are free every month.

### Self-hosting the Open-Source Hobby Deploy (Advanced)

For self-hosting, deploy a hobby instance with Docker on Linux:

```bash
/bin/bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/posthog/posthog/HEAD/bin/deploy-hobby)"
```

Open-source deployments are suitable for approximately 100k events per month. Consider migrating to [PostHog Cloud](https://posthog.com/docs/migrate/migrate-to-cloud) for larger needs.

**Important:**  We do not provide customer support or guarantees for self-hosted deployments. Refer to our [self-hosting documentation](https://posthog.com/docs/self-host), [troubleshooting guide](https://posthog.com/docs/self-host/deploy/troubleshooting), and [disclaimer](https://posthog.com/docs/self-host/open-source/disclaimer).
