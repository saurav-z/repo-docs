## Getting Started with PostHog

### PostHog Cloud (Recommended)

The fastest and most reliable way to get started with PostHog is by signing up for a free PostHog Cloud account.  Get started with [PostHog Cloud](https://us.posthog.com/signup) or [PostHog Cloud EU](https://eu.posthog.com/signup). You get 1 million events, 5k recordings, 1M flag requests, 100k exceptions, and 250 survey responses free every month.

### Self-hosting (Advanced)

If you prefer to self-host, deploy a hobby instance in one line with Docker:

```bash
/bin/bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/posthog/posthog/HEAD/bin/deploy-hobby)"
```

Self-hosted deployments are suitable for up to 100k events per month; beyond that, consider [migrating to PostHog Cloud](https://posthog.com/docs/migrate/migrate-to-cloud).

Note:  Customer support and guarantees are not provided for self-hosted instances. Refer to the [self-hosting docs](https://posthog.com/docs/self-host), [troubleshooting guide](https://posthog.com/docs/self-host/deploy/troubleshooting), and [disclaimer](https://posthog.com/docs/self-host/open-source/disclaimer) for further information.
