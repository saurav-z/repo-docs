## Getting Started with PostHog

### PostHog Cloud (Recommended)

The easiest and most reliable way to get started with PostHog is by signing up for a free account on [PostHog Cloud](https://us.posthog.com/signup) or [PostHog Cloud EU](https://eu.posthog.com/signup). Enjoy a free tier with 1 million events, 5k recordings, 1M flag requests, 100k exceptions, and 1500 survey responses each month.

### Self-hosting the open-source hobby deploy (Advanced)

For self-hosting, deploy a hobby instance with Docker (4GB memory recommended):

```bash
/bin/bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/posthog/posthog/HEAD/bin/deploy-hobby)"
```

Note: Open-source deployments scale to approximately 100k events per month. For larger deployments, migrate to [PostHog Cloud](https://posthog.com/docs/migrate/migrate-to-cloud).
