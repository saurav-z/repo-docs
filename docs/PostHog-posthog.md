## Getting Started with PostHog

### PostHog Cloud (Recommended)

The easiest way to get started is to sign up for free to [PostHog Cloud](https://us.posthog.com/signup) or [PostHog Cloud EU](https://eu.posthog.com/signup). You get 1 million events, 5k recordings, 1M flag requests, 100k exceptions, and 1500 survey responses free every month.

### Self-hosting the open-source hobby deploy (Advanced)

Deploy a hobby instance on Linux with Docker:

```bash
/bin/bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/posthog/posthog/HEAD/bin/deploy-hobby)"
```

Self-hosted deployments should scale to approximately 100k events per month.

We _do not_ provide customer support or offer guarantees for open source deployments. See our [self-hosting docs](https://posthog.com/docs/self-host), [troubleshooting guide](https://posthog.com/docs/self-host/deploy/troubleshooting), and [disclaimer](https://posthog.com/docs/self-host/open-source/disclaimer) for more info.
