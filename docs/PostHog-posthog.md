## Getting started with PostHog

### PostHog Cloud (Recommended)

The easiest and most reliable way to get started with PostHog is by signing up for free to¬†[PostHog Cloud](https://us.posthog.com/signup) or [PostHog Cloud EU](https://eu.posthog.com/signup). The free tier includes 1 million events, 5k recordings, 1M flag requests, 100k exceptions, and 1500 survey responses per month. Paid plans are based on usage.

### Self-hosting the open-source hobby deploy (Advanced)

For self-hosting, deploy a hobby instance with Docker on Linux using this command (recommended with 4GB memory):

```bash
/bin/bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/posthog/posthog/HEAD/bin/deploy-hobby)"
```

Self-hosted deployments typically support up to 100k events per month. For larger volumes, consider migrating to [PostHog Cloud](https://posthog.com/docs/migrate/migrate-to-cloud).

**Important:** Open-source deployments don't receive customer support or guarantees. Refer to our [self-hosting docs](https://posthog.com/docs/self-host), [troubleshooting guide](https://posthog.com/docs/self-host/deploy/troubleshooting), and [disclaimer](https://posthog.com/docs/self-host/open-source/disclaimer) for details.
