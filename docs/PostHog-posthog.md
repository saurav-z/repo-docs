*   **Session Replays:** Watch real user sessions to diagnose issues and understand user interactions.
*   **Feature Flags:** Safely roll out features to select users with feature flags.
*   **Experiments:** Test changes and measure their impact on goal metrics. Set up experiments with no-code options.
*   **Error Tracking:** Track errors, receive alerts, and resolve issues to improve your product.
*   **Surveys:** Create surveys with no-code templates or a custom survey builder.
*   **Data Warehouse:** Sync data from external tools like Stripe, Hubspot, and your data warehouse. Query it alongside your product data.
