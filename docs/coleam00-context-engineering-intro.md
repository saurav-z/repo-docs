# Level Up Your AI Coding with Context Engineering: A Comprehensive Guide

Context Engineering revolutionizes AI coding by providing AI assistants with the detailed information they need to build complex features from start to finish.  Get started with this powerful template: [Original Repo](https://github.com/coleam00/context-engineering-intro)

## Key Features:

*   **Comprehensive Context:** Provide AI with documentation, examples, rules, and validation to ensure consistent and reliable code generation.
*   **Simplified Workflow:**  Generate detailed implementation blueprints (PRPs) with a single command, guiding the AI assistant through each step.
*   **Reduced AI Failures:** Minimize errors by equipping your AI with the context it needs to avoid common pitfalls.
*   **Self-Correcting Capabilities:** Leverage built-in validation to ensure the AI iteratively fixes its own mistakes.
*   **Improved Consistency:** Ensure adherence to your project's patterns and conventions, leading to higher-quality code.

## Quick Start

```bash
# 1. Clone the template
git clone https://github.com/coleam00/Context-Engineering-Intro.git
cd Context-Engineering-Intro

# 2. Customize project rules (optional - edit CLAUDE.md)

# 3. Add code examples to the examples/ folder (highly recommended)

# 4. Create your feature request in INITIAL.md

# 5. Generate a Product Requirements Prompt (PRP)
# In Claude Code, run:
/generate-prp INITIAL.md

# 6. Execute the PRP to implement your feature
# In Claude Code, run:
/execute-prp PRPs/your-feature-name.md
```

## What is Context Engineering?

Context Engineering is a superior approach to traditional prompt engineering, providing AI assistants with a comprehensive understanding of your project's needs.

### Prompt Engineering vs. Context Engineering

**Prompt Engineering:** Focuses on clever wording to elicit desired behavior.  *Limited in scope.*

**Context Engineering:** Provides a complete system including documentation, examples, rules, and validation. *Enables complex feature creation.*

### Benefits of Context Engineering

1.  **Reduce AI Failures**: Address context gaps, not just model limitations.
2.  **Ensure Consistency**: AI adheres to your project's conventions and patterns.
3.  **Enable Complex Features**: AI can handle multi-step implementations.
4.  **Self-Correcting**: Built-in validation and iteration.

```

## Step-by-Step Guide

### 1. Set Up Project-Wide Rules (CLAUDE.md)

Customize `CLAUDE.md` with project-specific rules:

*   **Project Awareness:** Document review, task management.
*   **Code Structure:**  File size limits, module organization.
*   **Testing Requirements:** Unit test patterns, coverage goals.
*   **Style Conventions:** Language preferences, formatting standards.
*   **Documentation Standards:** Docstring formats, commenting practices.

**Use the provided template as a starting point.**

### 2. Create Your Feature Request (INITIAL.md)

Describe your desired feature in `INITIAL.md`:

```markdown
## FEATURE:
[Describe your feature's specific functionality and requirements]

## EXAMPLES:
[List relevant examples in the examples/ folder and explain their use]

## DOCUMENTATION:
[Include links to documentation, APIs, or other relevant resources]

## OTHER CONSIDERATIONS:
[Mention gotchas, unique requirements, or common AI pitfalls]
```

**See `INITIAL_EXAMPLE.md` for an example feature request.**

### 3. Generate the PRP

PRPs (Product Requirements Prompts) are implementation blueprints for AI coding assistants. Run this command within Claude Code:

```bash
/generate-prp INITIAL.md
```

This command will:

1.  Analyze your codebase.
2.  Gather relevant documentation.
3.  Create a comprehensive PRP in `PRPs/your-feature-name.md`.

**Note:** `/generate-prp` uses custom commands defined in `.claude/commands/`.  See their implementation for details.

### 4. Execute the PRP

Implement your feature by running:

```bash
/execute-prp PRPs/your-feature-name.md
```

The AI assistant will:

1.  Read the PRP's context.
2.  Create an implementation plan.
3.  Execute each step with validation.
4.  Run tests and fix any issues.
5.  Ensure all requirements are met.

## Writing Effective INITIAL.md Files

### Key Sections

**FEATURE:**  Be specific, describing the functionality, and desired output.
**EXAMPLES:** Leverage the `examples/` folder, referencing relevant code patterns.
**DOCUMENTATION:** Include URLs to all relevant APIs and documentation.
**OTHER CONSIDERATIONS:**  Address any special requirements or potential issues.

## The PRP Workflow

### How /generate-prp Works

1.  **Research Phase:** Codebase analysis, pattern identification.
2.  **Documentation Gathering:** API documentation integration.
3.  **Blueprint Creation:** Step-by-step implementation with validation.
4.  **Quality Check:** Confidence scoring.

### How /execute-prp Works

1.  **Load Context:** Reads the entire PRP
2.  **Plan:** Creates a detailed task list.
3.  **Execute:** Implements each component.
4.  **Validate:** Runs tests and linting.
5.  **Iterate:** Fixes any issues.
6.  **Complete:** Ensures all requirements are met.

## Using Examples Effectively

The `examples/` folder is **critical** for successful AI coding.

### What to Include in Examples

*   Code structure patterns
*   Testing patterns
*   Integration patterns
*   CLI patterns

### Example Structure

```
examples/
├── README.md           # Example descriptions
├── cli.py              # CLI implementation pattern
├── agent/              # Agent architecture patterns
│   ├── agent.py      # Agent creation pattern
│   ├── tools.py      # Tool implementation pattern
│   └── providers.py  # Multi-provider pattern
└── tests/            # Testing patterns
    ├── test_agent.py # Unit test patterns
    └── conftest.py   # Pytest configuration
```

## Best Practices

### 1. Be Explicit in INITIAL.md
Provide specific requirements and constraints.

### 2. Provide Comprehensive Examples
More examples lead to better implementations.

### 3. Use Validation Gates
PRPs include test commands to ensure working code.

### 4. Leverage Documentation
Include official API docs and relevant resources.

### 5. Customize CLAUDE.md
Add your project-specific rules and standards.
