## What's a Task Queue?

Task queues are essential for distributing work across threads or machines.  Celery facilitates communication between clients and workers via messages, allowing for high availability and scalability.

## What Do I Need?

*   **Python Versions:** Celery 5.5.x supports Python 3.8, 3.9, 3.10, 3.11, 3.12, and 3.13, as well as PyPy3.9+ (v7.3.12+). For older Python versions, use earlier Celery releases as specified in the original README.

*   **Message Brokers:** Celery utilizes message brokers like RabbitMQ, Redis, Amazon SQS, and others to manage task distribution.

## Get Started

Begin your Celery journey with the following resources:

*   `First steps with Celery`_:  Begin with the bare minimum needed to get started.
*   `Next steps`_: A more complete overview, showing more features.

## Celery is...

*   **Simple:**  Easy to use and maintain, with no configuration files needed.
*   **Highly Available:**  Workers and clients automatically retry in case of connection loss.
*   **Fast:** Processes millions of tasks per minute with low latency.
*   **Flexible:** Extensible with custom implementations for pools, serializers, and more.

## It Supports...

*   **Message Transports:** RabbitMQ, Redis, Amazon SQS, Google Pub/Sub, Zookeeper, Pyro4, SoftLayer Message Queue, Consul.io Key/Value store, and others.
*   **Concurrency:** Prefork, Eventlet_, gevent_, and single-threaded ("solo") options.
*   **Result Stores:** AMQP, Redis, memcached, SQLAlchemy, Django ORM, Apache Cassandra, IronCache, Elasticsearch, Google Cloud Storage, Couchbase, ArangoDB, Riak, Cosmos DB, and others.
*   **Serialization:** *pickle*, *json*, *yaml*, *msgpack*, with *zlib* and *bzip2* compression.
