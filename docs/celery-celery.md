**Key Features:**

*   **Asynchronous Task Execution:** Offloads time-consuming tasks to the background, improving application responsiveness.
*   **Distributed Processing:** Distributes tasks across multiple workers and machines for scalability.
*   **Message Broker Support:** Integrates seamlessly with popular message brokers like RabbitMQ, Redis, and others.
*   **Simple to Use:** Easy to set up and configure, with minimal configuration files required.
*   **Highly Available:** Provides automatic retries and supports HA brokers for robust operation.
*   **Fast Performance:** Processes millions of tasks per minute with low latency.
*   **Flexible and Extensible:**  Customizable with support for custom pool implementations, serializers, compression schemes, and more.
*   **Framework Integration:**  Provides easy integration with popular Python web frameworks like Django, Flask, and Pyramid.

## What's a Task Queue?

Task queues are the backbone of asynchronous task processing, distributing work across threads or machines.  Celery utilizes task queues to manage units of work, which are then processed by dedicated worker processes monitoring the queue for new tasks to perform. Celery communicates using messages, facilitating interaction between clients and workers through a message broker.

## What do I need?

Celery version 5.5.x runs on:

*   Python (3.8, 3.9, 3.10, 3.11, 3.12, 3.13)
*   PyPy3.9+ (v7.3.12+)

Celery is typically used with a message broker.  RabbitMQ and Redis are feature-complete options, but experimental support exists for other solutions, including SQLite for local development.

## It supports...

*   **Message Transports:** RabbitMQ, Redis, Amazon SQS, Google Pub/Sub
*   **Concurrency:** Prefork, Eventlet, gevent, single threaded (``solo``)
*   **Result Stores:** AMQP, Redis, memcached, SQLAlchemy, Django ORM, Apache Cassandra, IronCache, Elasticsearch, Google Cloud Storage
*   **Serialization:** pickle, json, yaml, msgpack, zlib, bzip2 compression, and cryptographic message signing

## Framework Integration

Celery provides easy integration with popular Python web frameworks:

*   Django
*   Pyramid
*   Pylons
*   Flask
*   web2py
*   Tornado
*   FastAPI
