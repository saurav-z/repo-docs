TagStudio is a user-focused document management system that gives you control over your files.  No proprietary formats, no invasive sidecar files, and no disruption to your existing file structure. Easily organize photos, videos, documents, and more with a flexible tagging system.

*   **Flexible Tagging:** Create custom tags with inheritance, aliases, and categories for powerful organization.
*   **Custom Metadata:** Add detailed information to your files using custom metadata fields like name, author, description, and notes.
*   **Robust Search:** Quickly find files with advanced search options using tags, file paths, file types, and boolean operators.
*   **File Preview:** Preview and open files directly within TagStudio, with support for many popular file types.
*   **Open Standards:**  No proprietary formats - your data remains accessible and portable.

**Important Notes:** TagStudio is currently in an Alpha state. While the core features are usable, some optimizations and QoL features are still in development. Always back up your library data! For detailed information, see the [documentation](https://docs.tagstud.io/).
