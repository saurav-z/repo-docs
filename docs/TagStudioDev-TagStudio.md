# TagStudio: Organize Your Files with Freedom and Flexibility

**Tired of clunky file management?** [TagStudio](https://github.com/TagStudioDev/TagStudio) offers a user-focused document management system that empowers you to organize your files your way, without proprietary formats or filesystem upheaval.

## Key Features

*   **Tag-Based Organization:** Categorize your files with flexible and powerful tagging.
*   **Custom Metadata:** Add detailed information like descriptions, notes, and author information.
*   **Tag Inheritance:** Create "taggable tags" that inherit values from parent tags, for efficient organization.
*   **Comprehensive Search:** Find files quickly using tags, file paths, types, and boolean operators.
*   **File Preview:** Preview images, videos, text documents, and more directly within the application.
*   **No File Modification:** TagStudio *never* touches, moves, or modifies your files unless you specifically choose to delete them.
*   **Multi-Platform Support:** Available for Windows, macOS (Apple Silicon & Intel), and Linux.

## Goals

*   Achieve a portable, private, extensible, open-format, and feature-rich system of organizing and rediscovering files.
*   Provide powerful methods for organization, notably the concept of tag inheritance, or "taggable tags" (and in the near future, the combination of composition-based tags).
*   Create an implementation of such a system that is resilient against a user’s actions outside the program (modifying, moving, or renaming files) while also not burdening the user with mandatory sidecar files or requiring them to change their existing file structures and workflows.
*   Support a wide range of users spanning across different platforms, multi-user setups, and those with large (several terabyte) libraries.
*   Make the dang thing look nice, too. It’s 2025, not 1995.

## Priorities

1.  **The concept:** Even if TagStudio as an application fails, I’d hope that the idea lives on in a superior project. The [goals](#goals) outlined above don’t reference TagStudio once - _TagStudio_ is what references the _goals._
2.  **The system:** Frontends and implementations can vary, as they should. The core underlying metadata management system is what should be interoperable between different frontends, programs, and operating systems. A standard implementation for this should settle as development continues. This opens up the doors for improved and varied clients, integration with third-party applications, and more.
3.  **The application:** If nothing else, TagStudio the application serves as the first (and so far only) implementation for this system of metadata management. This has the responsibility of doing the idea justice and showing just what’s possible when it comes to user file management.
4.  (The name.) I think it’s fine for an app or client, but it doesn’t really make sense for a system or standard. I suppose this will evolve with time...
