## Goals

*   To achieve a portable, private, extensible, open-format, and feature-rich system of organizing and rediscovering files.
*   To provide powerful methods for organization, notably the concept of tag inheritance, or "taggable tags" _(and in the near future, the combination of composition-based tags)._
*   To create an implementation of such a system that is resilient against a user’s actions outside the program (modifying, moving, or renaming files) while also not burdening the user with mandatory sidecar files or requiring them to change their existing file structures and workflows.
*   To support a wide range of users spanning across different platforms, multi-user setups, and those with large (several terabyte) libraries.
*   To make the dang thing look nice, too. It’s 2025, not 1995.

## Priorities

1.  **The concept.** Even if TagStudio as an application fails, I’d hope that the idea lives on in a superior project. The [goals](#goals) outlined above don’t reference TagStudio once - _TagStudio_ is what references the _goals._
2.  **The system.** Frontends and implementations can vary, as they should. The core underlying metadata management system is what should be interoperable between different frontends, programs, and operating systems. A standard implementation for this should settle as development continues. This opens up the doors for improved and varied clients, integration with third-party applications, and more.
3.  **The application.** If nothing else, TagStudio the application serves as the first (and so far only) implementation for this system of metadata management. This has the responsibility of doing the idea justice and showing just what’s possible when it comes to user file management.
4.  (The name.) I think it’s fine for an app or client, but it doesn’t really make sense for a system or standard. I suppose this will evolve with time...

## Current Features

### Libraries

*   Create libraries centered around a system directory. Libraries contain entries that represent your files combined with metadata.
*   Address moved, deleted, or otherwise "unlinked" files by using the "Fix Unlinked Entries" option in the Tools menu.

### Tagging + Custom Metadata

*   Add custom tags to your library entries
*   Add metadata to your library entries, including:
    *   Name, Author, Artist (Single-Line Text Fields)
    *   Description, Notes (Multiline Text Fields)
*   Create rich tags composed of a name, color, a list of aliases, and a list of "parent tags" - these being tags in which these tags inherit values from.
*   Copy and paste tags and fields across file entries
*   Automatically organize tags into groups based on parent tags marked as "categories"
*   Generate tags from your existing folder structure with the "Folders to Tags" macro (NOTE: these tags do NOT sync with folders after they are created)

### Search

*   Search for file entries based on tags, file path (`path:`), file types (`filetype:`), and even media types! (`mediatype:`). Path searches currently use [glob](<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glob_(programming)>) syntax, so you may need to wrap your filename or filepath in asterisks while searching. This will not be strictly necessary in future versions of the program.
*   Use and combine boolean operators (`AND`, `OR`, `NOT`) along with parentheses groups, quotation escaping, and underscore substitution to create detailed search queries
*   Use special search conditions (`special:untagged` and `special:empty`) to find file entries without tags or fields, respectively

### File Entries

*   Nearly all file types are supported in TagStudio libraries - just not all have dedicated thumbnail support.
*   Preview most image file types, animated GIFs, videos, plain text documents, audio files, Blender projects, and more!
*   Open files or file locations by right-clicking on thumbnails and previews and selecting the respective context menu options. You can also click on the preview panel image to open the file, and click the file path label to open its location.
*   Delete files from both your library and drive by right-clicking the thumbnail(s) and selecting the "Move to Trash"/"Move to Recycle Bin" option.

## Usage

### Creating/Opening a Library

Open or create a library using File -> Open/Create Library from the menu bar.

### Refreshing the Library

Libraries under 10,000 files automatically scan for new or modified files when opened. To refresh manually, select "Refresh Directories" under the File menu.

### Adding Tags to File Entries

Access the "Add Tag" search box by clicking on the "Add Tag" button, using the "Add Tags to Selected" option from the File menu, or pressing <kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>Shift</kbd>+<kbd>T</kbd>.

Search for or create tags, and add them to selected entries. Press <kbd>Enter</kbd>/<kbd>Return</kbd> to quickly add the top result.

Remove tags by clicking the "-" icon on the tag preview.

### Adding Metadata to File Entries

Click the "Add Field" button and select the desired metadata type from the dropdown.

### Editing Metadata Fields

Edit fields by clicking the pencil icon.

> [!WARNING]
> Keyboard control and navigation is currently _very_ buggy, but will be improved in future versions.

### Creating Tags

Create new tags via the "New Tag" option in the Edit menu (<kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>T</kbd>). Define the tag name, shorthand, aliases, parent tags, and color.
   - The tag **name** is the base name of the tag. **_This does NOT have to be unique!_**
    - The tag **shorthand** is a special type of alias that displays in situations where screen space is more valuable, notably with name disambiguation.
    - **Aliases** are alternate names for a tag. These let you search for terms other than the exact tag name in order to find the tag again.
    - **Parent Tags** are tags in which this this tag can substitute for in searches. In other words, tags under this section are parents of this tag.
        -   Parent tags with the disambiguation check next to them will be used to help disambiguate tag names that may not be unique.
        -   For example: If you had a tag for "Freddy Fazbear", you might add "Five Nights at Freddy's" as one of the parent tags. If the disambiguation box is checked next to "Five Nights at Freddy's" parent tag, then the tag "Freddy Fazbear" will display as "Freddy Fazbear (Five Nights at Freddy's)". Furthermore, if the "Five Nights at Freddy's" tag has a shorthand like "FNAF", then the "Freddy Fazbear" tag will display as "Freddy Fazbear (FNAF)".
    - The **color** option lets you select an optional color palette to use for your tag.
    - The **"Is Category"** property lets you treat this tag as a category under which itself and any child tags inheriting from it will be sorted by inside the preview panel.

#### Tag Manager

Manage tags in the "Tag Manager" panel (Edit -> "Tag Manager"). Create, search for, edit, and delete tags.

### Editing Tags

Edit tags by clicking on a tag in the preview panel or selecting "Edit Tag" from the context menu.

### Relinking Moved Files

Files that are moved or renamed will show a broken link. Relink them using the "Manage Unlinked Entries" option under the Tools menu.

> [!WARNING]
> There is currently no method to relink entries to files that have been renamed - only moved or deleted. This is a high priority for future releases.

> [!WARNING]
> If multiple matches for a moved file are found (matches are currently defined as files with a matching filename as the original), TagStudio will currently ignore the match groups. Adding a GUI for manual selection, as well as smarter automated relinking, are high priorities for future versions.

### Saving the Library

Libraries are automatically saved. Create a backup with File -> Save Library Backup.

### Half-Implemented Features

Features from pre-public versions (9.0 and below) are yet to be fully implemented, including:

#### Fix Duplicate Files

Load in a .dupeguru file generated by [dupeGuru](https://github.com/arsenetar/dupeguru/) and mirror metadata across entries marked as duplicates. After mirroring, return to dupeGuru to manage deletion of the duplicate files. After deletion, use the "Fix Unlinked Entries" feature in TagStudio to delete the duplicate set of entries for the now-deleted files

> [!CAUTION]
> While this feature is functional, it’s a pretty roundabout process and can be streamlined in the future.

#### Macros

Apply tags and other metadata automatically depending on certain criteria. Set specific macros to run when the files are added to the library. Part of this includes applying tags automatically based on parent folders.

> [!CAUTION]
> Macro options are hardcoded, and there’s currently no way for the user to interface with this (still incomplete) system at all.

#### Gallery-dl Sidecar Importing

Import JSON sidecar data generated by [gallery-dl](https://github.com/mikf/gallery-dl).

> [!CAUTION]
> This feature is not supported or documented in any official capacity whatsoever. It will likely be rolled-in to a larger and more generalized sidecar importing feature in the future.

## FAQ

### What State Is the Project Currently In?

TagStudio is currently in Alpha (v9.5.0), very usable but with some quirks and missing features. See the [Feature Roadmap](https://docs.tagstud.io/updates/roadmap/) for upcoming additions.

### What Features Are You Planning on Adding?

See the [Feature Roadmap](https://docs.tagstud.io/updates/roadmap/) for planned features and the GitHub [milestones](https://github.com/TagStudioDev/TagStudio/milestones) for release details.

### Features That Will NOT Be Added

*   Native Cloud Integration
    *   There are plenty of services already (native or third-party) that allow you to mount your cloud drives as virtual drives on your system. Hosting a TagStudio library on one of these mounts should function similarly to what native integration would look like.
    *   Supporting native cloud integrations such as these would be an unnecessary "reinventing the wheel" burden for us that is outside the scope of this project.
*   Native ChatGPT/Non-Local LLM Integration
    *   This could mean different things depending on your intentions. Whether it's trying to use an LLM to replace the native search, or to trying to use a model for image recognition, I'm not interested in hooking people's TagStudio libraries into non-local LLMs such as ChatGPT and/or turn the program into a "chatbot" interface (see: [Goals/Privacy](#goals)). I wouldn't, however, mind using **locally** hosted models to provide the _optional_ ability for additional searching and tagging methods (especially when it comes to facial recognition) - but this would likely take the form of plugins external to the core program anyway.

### Why Is this Already Version 9?

The project went through several major iterations and rewrites during early development.  The current v9.x scheme reserves v10.0 for full implementation of the [Feature Roadmap](https://docs.tagstud.io/updates/roadmap/). Alpha status will be dropped when the core features are implemented or the project is stable and feature-rich enough to be considered "Beta" and beyond.
