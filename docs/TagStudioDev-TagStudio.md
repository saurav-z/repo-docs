TagStudio offers a flexible, tag-based system for organizing your photos and files, avoiding proprietary formats and intrusive filesystem changes.  **Learn more and explore the documentation at [docs.tagstud.io](https://docs.tagstud.io)!**

> [!NOTE]
> We've migrated to an SQL database backend. Pre-existing libraries created with official TagStudio releases can be opened and migrated with the new v9.5+ releases!

> [!IMPORTANT]
> This project is in early development. Backups are crucial. TagStudio will not:
>
> -   Modify your files unless you explicitly use the "Delete File(s)" feature.
> -   Require you to recreate tags or libraries with new releases.
> -   Magically recall all your unseen images. You control the organization.

## Key Features

*   **Tagging and Metadata:**
    *   Create custom, powerful tags with names, aliases, colors and parent/category relationships for organized searching
    *   Add custom metadata fields (name, author, description, notes) to your files.
    *   Copy and paste tags and fields across file entries
    *   Automatically organize tags into groups based on parent tags marked as "categories"
    *   Generate tags from your existing folder structure
*   **Powerful Search:**
    *   Search by tags, file paths, file types, and media types
    *   Use boolean operators (AND, OR, NOT) and parentheses for complex queries
    *   Use special search conditions (`special:untagged` and `special:empty`) to find file entries without tags or fields, respectively
*   **Flexible Library Management:**
    *   Create libraries/vaults centered around a system directory. Libraries contain a series of entries: the representations of your files combined with metadata fields. Each entry represents a file in your libraryâ€™s directory, and is linked to its location.
    *   Automatically fix unlinked files
    *   Preview most image file types, animated GIFs, videos, plain text documents, audio files, Blender projects, and more!
    *   Open files or file locations by right-clicking
    *   Delete files from your library and drive via context menu
*   **Open Format & Future-Proof:** No proprietary formats or sidecar files, ensuring long-term access to your data.
*   **Cross-Platform:** Compatible with Windows, macOS (Apple Silicon & Intel), and Linux.
