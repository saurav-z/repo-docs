## Data Privacy

### Self-hosted PR-Agent

### Qodo-hosted Qodo Merge ðŸ’Ž

*   Qodo Merge does not store, or train on your data.

### Qodo Merge Chrome extension

*   The Chrome extension modifies the GitHub PR screen's visual appearance. It does not transmit any user's repo or pull request code, but is governed by the standard privacy policy of Qodo-Merge.
