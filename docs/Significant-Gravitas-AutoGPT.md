## AutoGPT Platform: Deep Dive

The AutoGPT platform consists of a Frontend and a Server, working together to build and execute AI agents.

### üß± AutoGPT Frontend

The user-friendly interface where you create, manage, and interact with your AI agents. Key components include:

*   **Agent Builder:** Build custom agents with a low-code interface.
*   **Workflow Management:** Connect blocks to create automated workflows.
*   **Deployment Controls:** Manage agent lifecycles from testing to production.
*   **Ready-to-Use Agents:** Choose from pre-configured agents to begin automating immediately.
*   **Agent Interaction:** Run and interact with built and pre-configured agents.
*   **Monitoring and Analytics:** Monitor performance, analyze data, and improve automation processes.

### üíΩ AutoGPT Server

The engine that powers your AI agents. This includes:

*   **Source Code:** The core logic driving agents and automation.
*   **Infrastructure:** Systems for reliable and scalable performance.
*   **Marketplace:** Find and deploy pre-built agents.

### üêô Example Agents

*   **Generate Viral Videos:** Automatically create videos based on trending topics.
*   **Extract Top Quotes:** Transcribe videos and extract impactful quotes for social media.

## ü§ñ AutoGPT Classic

The classic version of AutoGPT provides a toolkit for building and benchmarking AI agents.

### üèóÔ∏è Forge

**Forge your own agent!** &ndash; Forge is a ready-to-go toolkit to build your own agent application. It handles most of the boilerplate code, letting you channel all your creativity into the things that set *your* agent apart. All tutorials are located [here](https://medium.com/@aiedge/autogpt-forge-e3de53cc58ec). Components from [`forge`](/classic/forge/) can also be used individually to speed up development and reduce boilerplate in your agent project.

üöÄ [**Getting Started with Forge**](https://github.com/Significant-Gravitas/AutoGPT/blob/master/classic/forge/tutorials/001_getting_started.md) &ndash;
This guide will walk you through the process of creating your own agent and using the benchmark and user interface.

üìò [Learn More](https://github.com/Significant-Gravitas/AutoGPT/tree/master/classic/forge) about Forge

### üéØ Benchmark

**Measure your agent's performance!** The `agbenchmark` can be used with any agent that supports the agent protocol, and the integration with the project's [CLI] makes it even easier to use with AutoGPT and forge-based agents. The benchmark offers a stringent testing environment. Our framework allows for autonomous, objective performance evaluations, ensuring your agents are primed for real-world action.

### üíª UI

**Makes agents easy to use!** The `frontend` gives you a user-friendly interface to control and monitor your agents. It connects to agents through the [agent protocol](#-agent-protocol), ensuring compatibility with many agents from both inside and outside of our ecosystem.

üìò [Learn More](https://github.com/Significant-Gravitas/AutoGPT/tree/master/classic/frontend) about the Frontend

### ‚å®Ô∏è CLI

[CLI]: #-cli

To make it as easy as possible to use all of the tools offered by the repository, a CLI is included at the root of the repo:

```shell
$ ./run
Usage: cli.py [OPTIONS] COMMAND [ARGS]...

Options:
  --help  Show this message and exit.

Commands:
  agent      Commands to create, start and stop agents
  benchmark  Commands to start the benchmark and list tests and categories
  setup      Installs dependencies needed for your system.
```

Just clone the repo, install dependencies with `./run setup`, and you should be good to go!

## ü§ù Agent Protocol

AutoGPT uses the [agent protocol](https://agentprotocol.ai/) for standardized communication between agents, the frontend, and the benchmark.
