[Learn more about building custom blocks](https://docs.agpt.co/platform/new_blocks/)

### üíΩ AutoGPT Server

The core of the platform where agents run, featuring:

*   **Source Code:** The foundational logic for agents and automation.
*   **Infrastructure:** Systems for reliable and scalable performance.
*   **Marketplace:** Access to a wide range of pre-built agents.

### üêô Example Agents

Automate tasks with pre-built or custom agents:

1.  **Generate Viral Videos:** Reads trending topics on Reddit, creates short-form videos.
2.  **Identify Top Quotes from Videos:** Transcribes YouTube videos, identifies key quotes, and generates social media posts.

## ‚öôÔ∏è AutoGPT Classic

### üõ†Ô∏è Forge

**Forge your own agent!** &ndash; Forge is a ready-to-go toolkit to build your own agent application. It handles most of the boilerplate code, letting you channel all your creativity into the things that set *your* agent apart. All tutorials are located [here](https://medium.com/@aiedge/autogpt-forge-e3de53cc58ec). Components from [`forge`](/classic/forge/) can also be used individually to speed up development and reduce boilerplate in your agent project.

üöÄ [**Getting Started with Forge**](https://github.com/Significant-Gravitas/AutoGPT/blob/master/classic/forge/tutorials/001_getting_started.md) &ndash;
This guide will walk you through the process of creating your own agent and using the benchmark and user interface.

üìò [Learn More](https://github.com/Significant-Gravitas/AutoGPT/tree/master/classic/forge) about Forge

### üéØ Benchmark

**Measure your agent's performance!** The `agbenchmark` can be used with any agent that supports the agent protocol, and the integration with the project's [CLI] makes it even easier to use with AutoGPT and forge-based agents. The benchmark offers a stringent testing environment. Our framework allows for autonomous, objective performance evaluations, ensuring your agents are primed for real-world action.

üìò [Learn More](https://github.com/Significant-Gravitas/AutoGPT/tree/master/classic/benchmark) about the Benchmark

### üíª UI

**Makes agents easy to use!** The `frontend` gives you a user-friendly interface to control and monitor your agents. It connects to agents through the [agent protocol](#-agent-protocol), ensuring compatibility with many agents from both inside and outside of our ecosystem.

<!-- TODO: insert screenshot of front end -->

The frontend works out-of-the-box with all agents in the repo. Just use the [CLI] to run your agent of choice!

üìò [Learn More](https://github.com/Significant-Gravitas/AutoGPT/tree/master/classic/frontend) about the Frontend

### ‚å®Ô∏è CLI

To make it as easy as possible to use all of the tools offered by the repository, a CLI is included at the root of the repo:

```shell
$ ./run
Usage: cli.py [OPTIONS] COMMAND [ARGS]...

Options:
  --help  Show this message and exit.

Commands:
  agent      Commands to create, start and stop agents
  benchmark  Commands to start the benchmark and list tests and categories
  setup      Installs dependencies needed for your system.
```

Just clone the repo, install dependencies with `./run setup`, and you should be good to go!
