### üèóÔ∏è Forge

**Forge your own agent!** &ndash; Forge is a ready-to-go toolkit to build your own agent application. It handles most of the boilerplate code, letting you channel all your creativity into the things that set *your* agent apart. All tutorials are located [here](https://medium.com/@aiedge/autogpt-forge-e3de53cc58ec). Components from [`forge`](/classic/forge/) can also be used individually to speed up development and reduce boilerplate in your agent project.

üöÄ [**Getting Started with Forge**](https://github.com/Significant-Gravitas/AutoGPT/blob/master/classic/forge/tutorials/001_getting_started.md) &ndash;
This guide will walk you through the process of creating your own agent and using the benchmark and user interface.

### üéØ Benchmark

**Measure your agent's performance!** The `agbenchmark` can be used with any agent that supports the agent protocol, and the integration with the project's [CLI] makes it even easier to use with AutoGPT and forge-based agents. The benchmark offers a stringent testing environment. Our framework allows for autonomous, objective performance evaluations, ensuring your agents are primed for real-world action.

### üíª UI

**Makes agents easy to use!** The `frontend` gives you a user-friendly interface to control and monitor your agents. It connects to agents through the [agent protocol](#-agent-protocol), ensuring compatibility with many agents from both inside and outside of our ecosystem.

<!-- TODO: insert screenshot of front end -->

The frontend works out-of-the-box with all agents in the repo. Just use the [CLI] to run your agent of choice!
