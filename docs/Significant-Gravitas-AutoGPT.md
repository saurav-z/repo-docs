### Installation

For detailed setup instructions, including the latest updates, please refer to the [official self-hosting guide](https://docs.agpt.co/platform/getting-started/).

This tutorial assumes you have Docker, VSCode, git and npm installed.

#### ‚ö° Quick Setup with One-Line Script (Recommended for Local Hosting)

Simplify your setup and launch your local instance in minutes using our automatic setup script.

For macOS/Linux:

```bash
curl -fsSL https://setup.agpt.co/install.sh -o install.sh && bash install.sh
```

For Windows (PowerShell):

```powershell
powershell -c "iwr https://setup.agpt.co/install.bat -o install.bat; ./install.bat"
```

This script handles dependencies, configures Docker, and launches your local instance in one step.

## Core Components

### üß± AutoGPT Frontend

The user interface where you'll design, manage, and interact with your AI automation projects.

### üíΩ AutoGPT Server

The engine room where your AI agents run, providing the source code, infrastructure, and marketplace.

### üêô Example Agents

Here are two examples of what you can do with AutoGPT:

1.  **Generate Viral Videos from Trending Topics**
    *   This agent reads topics on Reddit.
    *   It identifies trending topics.
    *   It then automatically creates a short-form video based on the content.

2.  **Identify Top Quotes from Videos for Social Media**
    *   This agent subscribes to your YouTube channel.
    *   When you post a new video, it transcribes it.
    *   It uses AI to identify the most impactful quotes to generate a summary.
    *   Then, it writes a post to automatically publish to your social media.

These examples show just a glimpse of what you can achieve with AutoGPT! You can create customized workflows to build agents for any use case.

## ü§ñ AutoGPT Classic

> Below is information about the classic version of AutoGPT.

**üõ†Ô∏è [Build your own Agent - Quickstart](classic/FORGE-QUICKSTART.md)**

### üèóÔ∏è Forge

**Forge your own agent!** &ndash; Forge is a ready-to-go toolkit to build your own agent application. It handles most of the boilerplate code, letting you channel all your creativity into the things that set *your* agent apart. All tutorials are located [here](https://medium.com/@aiedge/autogpt-forge-e3de53cc58ec). Components from [`forge`](/classic/forge/) can also be used individually to speed up development and reduce boilerplate in your agent project.

üöÄ [**Getting Started with Forge**](https://github.com/Significant-Gravitas/AutoGPT/blob/master/classic/forge/tutorials/001_getting_started.md) &ndash;
This guide will walk you through the process of creating your own agent and using the benchmark and user interface.

üìò [Learn More](https://github.com/Significant-Gravitas/AutoGPT/tree/master/classic/forge) about Forge

### üéØ Benchmark

**Measure your agent's performance!** The `agbenchmark` can be used with any agent that supports the agent protocol, and the integration with the project's [CLI] makes it even easier to use with AutoGPT and forge-based agents. The benchmark offers a stringent testing environment. Our framework allows for autonomous, objective performance evaluations, ensuring your agents are primed for real-world action.

üìò [Learn More](https://github.com/Significant-Gravitas/AutoGPT/tree/master/classic/benchmark) about the Benchmark

### üíª UI

**Makes agents easy to use!** The `frontend` gives you a user-friendly interface to control and monitor your agents. It connects to agents through the [agent protocol](#-agent-protocol), ensuring compatibility with many agents from both inside and outside of our ecosystem.

<!-- TODO: insert screenshot of front end -->

The frontend works out-of-the-box with all agents in the repo. Just use the [CLI] to run your agent of choice!

üìò [Learn More](https://github.com/Significant-Gravitas/AutoGPT/tree/master/classic/frontend) about the Frontend

### ‚å®Ô∏è CLI

[CLI]: #-cli

To make it as easy as possible to use all of the tools offered by the repository, a CLI is included at the root of the repo:

```shell
$ ./run
Usage: cli.py [OPTIONS] COMMAND [ARGS]...

Options:
  --help  Show this message and exit.

Commands:
  agent      Commands to create, start and stop agents
  benchmark  Commands to start the benchmark and list tests and categories
  setup      Installs dependencies needed for your system.
```

Just clone the repo, install dependencies with `./run setup`, and you should be good to go!
