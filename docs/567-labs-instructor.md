## Getting Started

### Installation

Install Instructor in seconds:

```bash
pip install instructor
```

Or using your preferred package manager:

```bash
uv add instructor
poetry add instructor
```

### Basic Usage

Define your data model and extract structured information:

```python
from pydantic import BaseModel
import instructor

client = instructor.from_provider("openai/gpt-4o-mini")


class Product(BaseModel):
    name: str
    price: float
    in_stock: bool


product = client.chat.completions.create(
    response_model=Product,
    messages=[{"role": "user", "content": "iPhone 15 Pro, $999, available now"}],
)

print(product)
# Product(name='iPhone 15 Pro', price=999.0, in_stock=True)
```

### Production-Ready Features

*   **Automatic Retries:** Instructor automatically retries failed extractions.

    ```python
    from pydantic import BaseModel, field_validator


    class User(BaseModel):
        name: str
        age: int

        @field_validator('age')
        def validate_age(cls, v):
            if v < 0:
                raise ValueError('Age must be positive')
            return v


    # Instructor automatically retries when validation fails
    user = client.chat.completions.create(
        response_model=User,
        messages=[{"role": "user", "content": "..."}],
        max_retries=3,
    )
    ```

*   **Streaming Support:** Stream partial objects as they're generated.

    ```python
    from instructor import Partial

    for partial_user in client.chat.completions.create(
        response_model=Partial[User],
        messages=[{"role": "user", "content": "..."}],
        stream=True,
    ):
        print(partial_user)
        # User(name=None, age=None)
        # User(name="John", age=None)
        # User(name="John", age=25)
    ```

*   **Nested Objects:** Extract complex, nested data structures.

    ```python
    from typing import List


    class Address(BaseModel):
        street: str
        city: str
        country: str


    class User(BaseModel):
        name: str
        age: int
        addresses: List[Address]


    # Instructor handles nested objects automatically
    user = client.chat.completions.create(
        response_model=User,
        messages=[{"role": "user", "content": "..."}],
    )
    ```
