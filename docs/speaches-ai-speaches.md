# Speaches: Your AI Toolkit for Speech & Audio Processing

**Tired of limitations? Speaches is your open-source, OpenAI API-compatible solution for cutting-edge audio processing, offering streaming transcription, translation, and text-to-speech capabilities.**  This project, formerly known as `faster-whisper-server`, has evolved into a comprehensive toolkit for all your speech and audio needs. Learn more and contribute on the [original repository](https://github.com/speaches-ai/speaches).

## Key Features:

*   **OpenAI API Compatibility:** Seamlessly integrate with existing OpenAI tools and SDKs.
*   **Versatile Audio Generation:**
    *   Generate spoken audio summaries from text (text-to-speech).
    *   Perform sentiment analysis on audio recordings (speech-to-text).
    *   Enable asynchronous speech-to-speech interactions.
*   **Real-time Streaming:** Receive transcriptions via Server-Sent Events (SSE) as audio is processed, eliminating the need to wait for completion.
*   **Dynamic Model Management:** Automatically load and unload models based on usage, optimizing resource allocation.
*   **Advanced Text-to-Speech (TTS):** Utilize high-quality `kokoro` (ranked #1 in the [TTS Arena](https://huggingface.co/spaces/Pendrokar/TTS-Spaces-Arena)) and `piper` models for natural-sounding speech.
*   **GPU & CPU Support:** Leverage your hardware for optimal performance.
*   **Easy Deployment:** Deploy with Docker Compose or Docker.
*   **Real-time API:** Interact with audio streams in real-time ([Realtime API Documentation](https://speaches.ai/usage/realtime-api)).
