# Speaches: Your Open-Source, API-Compatible AI for Speech & Audio Generation

**Speaches** is an open-source project empowering you with OpenAI API-compatible access to streaming transcription, translation, and high-quality speech generation, offering a versatile alternative to proprietary solutions. Get started with [Speaches on GitHub](https://github.com/speaches-ai/speaches).

## Key Features:

*   **OpenAI API Compatibility:** Seamlessly integrate with existing tools and SDKs designed for the OpenAI API.
*   **Real-time Audio Generation:** Utilize the chat completions endpoint for diverse audio functionalities:
    *   Generate spoken summaries from text (text-to-speech).
    *   Conduct sentiment analysis on recordings (speech-to-text).
    *   Enable asynchronous speech-to-speech interactions.
*   **Streaming Support:** Receive transcriptions in real-time via Server-Sent Events (SSE) as audio is processed.
*   **Dynamic Model Management:** Automatically load and unload models based on your requests, optimizing resource usage.
*   **Text-to-Speech (TTS):** Leverage the power of `kokoro` (ranked #1 in the [TTS Arena](https://huggingface.co/spaces/Pendrokar/TTS-Spaces-Arena)) and `piper` models for high-quality speech synthesis.
*   **GPU & CPU Support:** Benefit from optimized performance on both GPU and CPU hardware.
*   **Docker Deployment:** Easily deploy with Docker Compose and Docker.
*   **Realtime API:** Stream audio-based interactions directly with the API.
*   **Highly Configurable:** Tailor the system to your specific needs through extensive configuration options.
