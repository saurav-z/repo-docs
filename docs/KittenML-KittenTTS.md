## Getting Started with Kitten TTS

### Installation

Install Kitten TTS using pip:

```bash
pip install https://github.com/KittenML/KittenTTS/releases/download/0.1/kittentts-0.1.0-py3-none-any.whl
```

### Basic Usage Example

Generate speech from text with the following Python code snippet:

```python
from kittentts import KittenTTS
m = KittenTTS("KittenML/kitten-tts-nano-0.2")

audio = m.generate("This high quality TTS model works without a GPU", voice='expr-voice-2-f' )

# available_voices : [  'expr-voice-2-m', 'expr-voice-2-f', 'expr-voice-3-m', 'expr-voice-3-f',  'expr-voice-4-m', 'expr-voice-4-f', 'expr-voice-5-m', 'expr-voice-5-f' ]

# Save the audio
import soundfile as sf
sf.write('output.wav', audio, 24000)
```

## System Requirements

Kitten TTS is designed to work on virtually any system.
