## Spack: The Ultimate Package Manager for High-Performance Computing

Spack is a powerful, open-source package manager designed to build and install multiple versions and configurations of software, particularly for High-Performance Computing (HPC) environments.  Find the original repository [here](https://github.com/spack/spack).
