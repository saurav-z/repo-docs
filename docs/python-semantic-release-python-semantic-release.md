# Automate Python Releases with Semantic Release ðŸš€

Tired of manual versioning and release processes?  **Python Semantic Release** streamlines your Python project releases by automating versioning and release management based on SemVer (Semantic Versioning) and your commit message conventions. Learn more and get started by visiting the [original repository](https://github.com/python-semantic-release/python-semantic-release).

## Key Features:

*   **Automated Versioning:**  Automatically determines your project's new version number based on your commit messages, adhering to SemVer principles.
*   **Commit Message Analysis:** Analyzes commit messages to determine the type of change (e.g., bug fix, feature addition, breaking change) and applies the appropriate version bump.
*   **Release Automation:** Automates the release process, including tagging, building, and publishing your Python packages to PyPI or other repositories.
*   **Simplified Workflow:** Reduces manual steps and human error, making releases faster and more reliable.
*   **GitHub Actions Integration:** Seamlessly integrates with GitHub Actions to automate your release pipeline.

## Using Python Semantic Release with GitHub Actions

The Python Semantic Release GitHub Action simplifies the process of automating your releases.  It executes the `semantic-release version` command using Python Semantic Release.

For detailed usage information, examples, and configuration options for the GitHub Action, please consult the [GitHub Actions section](https://python-semantic-release.readthedocs.io/en/stable/configuration/automatic-releases/github-actions.html) of the official documentation.
