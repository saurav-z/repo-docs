# Automate Your Python Releases with Semantic Versioning

Tired of manual Python releases? [Python Semantic Release](https://github.com/python-semantic-release/python-semantic-release) automates your releases using Semantic Versioning (SemVer) and commit message conventions, streamlining your workflow.

## Key Features:

*   **Automated Versioning:**  Automatically manages your project's version based on commit messages.
*   **Semantic Versioning (SemVer):**  Ensures consistent and predictable versioning (e.g., 1.2.3).
*   **Commit Message Driven:**  Interprets commit messages to determine whether to increment major, minor, or patch versions.
*   **Easy Integration:** Works seamlessly with popular tools and platforms.

## Utilizing the GitHub Action

Python Semantic Release provides a dedicated GitHub Action to simplify your release process. The action executes the command `semantic-release version` using the `python-semantic-release` package.
