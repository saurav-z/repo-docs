# Automate Your Python Releases with Semantic Versioning

**Effortlessly manage and automate your Python project releases using Semantic Versioning (SemVer) and commit message conventions.** [Learn more about python-semantic-release](https://github.com/python-semantic-release/python-semantic-release).

## Key Features of Python Semantic Release

*   **Automated Versioning:** Automates the process of determining the next version number based on your commit history.
*   **Semantic Versioning (SemVer) Compliance:** Adheres to the SemVer specification (Major.Minor.Patch).
*   **Commit Message Analysis:** Analyzes commit messages to determine the type of change (e.g., feature, bug fix, breaking change).
*   **Release Automation:** Automates the creation of tags, releases, and publishing to PyPI.
*   **GitHub Actions Integration:** Seamlessly integrates with GitHub Actions for automated releases on pull requests or merges.

## Using Python Semantic Release with GitHub Actions

The recommended way to integrate with GitHub Actions is as simple as running the command `semantic-release version`. Refer to the official documentation for detailed instructions and example configurations, available under the [GitHub Actions section](https://python-semantic-release.readthedocs.io/en/stable/configuration/automatic-releases/github-actions.html) of the official documentation.
