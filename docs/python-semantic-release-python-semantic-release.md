# Python Semantic Release: Automate Your Releases with SemVer & Commit Messages

Tired of manual releases and versioning headaches?  **Python Semantic Release simplifies your software release process by automating versioning based on semantic versioning (SemVer) and commit message conventions.**

[View the original repository on GitHub](https://github.com/python-semantic-release/python-semantic-release)

## Key Features:

*   **Automated Versioning:**  Automatically determines the next version number (major, minor, or patch) based on your commit messages, adhering to SemVer principles.
*   **Commit Message Parsing:**  Analyzes your commit history to understand the nature of your changes (e.g., bug fixes, new features, breaking changes).
*   **Release Process Automation:** Streamlines the entire release lifecycle, including tagging, publishing, and more.
*   **Integration with Build Tools:** Seamlessly integrates with popular build tools, simplifying your workflow.
*   **GitHub Actions Support:** Easily incorporate Python Semantic Release into your CI/CD pipelines using a dedicated GitHub Action.
