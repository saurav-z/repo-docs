# Automate Your Python Releases with Semantic Versioning

**Tired of manual releases and versioning headaches?** Python Semantic Release automates your Python project releases using Semantic Versioning (SemVer) and commit message conventions.

**Key Features:**

*   **Automated Versioning:**  Automatically determines the next version number based on your commit history, adhering to SemVer (Major.Minor.Patch).
*   **Commit Message-Driven Releases:**  Analyzes commit messages to identify the type of changes (bug fix, feature, breaking change) and trigger appropriate version bumps.
*   **GitHub Actions Integration:** Seamlessly integrates with GitHub Actions to automate the release process within your CI/CD pipelines.
*   **Supports all major Python Packaging formats:** Including setuptools, flit, and poetry.
*   **Easy to configure:** Simple, flexible configuration options to adapt to your project's specific needs.

## How it Works

Python Semantic Release analyzes your Git commit history, adhering to your project's [conventional commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/) standards.  Based on the identified change types, it determines the next appropriate version number according to SemVer principles.  It then handles the release process, updating your project's version, creating tags, and optionally publishing to PyPI.

## Using the GitHub Action

The Python Semantic Release GitHub Action simplifies the release process in your CI/CD workflows.  It executes the command `semantic-release version` using the `python-semantic-release` package, automating the versioning step.  Detailed usage examples and configuration options for the GitHub Action can be found in the official documentation.
