## Key Features

*   **Automated Versioning:** Automatically bumps your project's version based on your commit message conventions (e.g., `feat`, `fix`, `chore`).
*   **Semantic Versioning (SemVer) Compliant:** Ensures your releases follow the SemVer standard (MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH).
*   **GitHub Actions Integration:** Seamlessly integrates with GitHub Actions for automated releases on every push or pull request.
*   **Reduced Manual Effort:** Eliminates the need for manual version bumping, tagging, and release notes generation.
*   **Improved Release Reliability:** Minimizes human error and ensures consistent, predictable releases.
