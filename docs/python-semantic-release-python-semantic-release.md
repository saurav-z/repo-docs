## Using Python Semantic Release with GitHub Actions

The Python Semantic Release GitHub Action simplifies automating releases. To get started, simply add the action to your workflow, which internally runs the command `semantic-release version`.

**Detailed usage information and examples for the GitHub Action can be found in the official documentation:** [https://python-semantic-release.readthedocs.io/en/stable/configuration/automatic-releases/github-actions.html](https://python-semantic-release.readthedocs.io/en/stable/configuration/automatic-releases/github-actions.html)
