# Automate Your Python Releases with Semantic Versioning

**Tired of manual versioning? Python Semantic Release is your key to automated, accurate, and compliant releases.** This tool leverages Semantic Versioning (SemVer) and conventional commit message conventions to streamline your Python project's release process.

## Key Features

*   **Automated Version Bumping:** Automatically increments your project's version based on commit message analysis, adhering to SemVer principles (Major.Minor.Patch).
*   **Commit Message Parsing:** Understands common commit message formats to determine the type of change (e.g., fix, feat, refactor) and apply the correct version increment.
*   **Simplified Release Workflow:** Reduces manual steps, minimizes errors, and frees up your time for development.
*   **GitHub Actions Integration:** Seamlessly integrates with GitHub Actions for automated releases on every commit or push.

## Using the Python Semantic Release GitHub Action

For detailed usage instructions and examples on how to use the **Python Semantic Release** GitHub Action, please see the [GitHub Actions section](https://python-semantic-release.readthedocs.io/en/stable/configuration/automatic-releases/github-actions.html) of the official documentation.  This action executes the command `semantic-release version` using the `python-semantic-release` library.
