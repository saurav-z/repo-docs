Tired of manual versioning and release processes? **Python Semantic Release** streamlines your software releases by automating version bumping and package publishing based on Semantic Versioning (SemVer) and conventional commit messages.

## Key Features

*   **Automated Version Bumping:** Automatically updates your project's version based on commit message analysis, adhering to SemVer guidelines (MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH).
*   **Commit Message Parsing:** Understands conventional commit message formats to determine the type of change (fix, feat, chore, etc.) and how it impacts the version.
*   **Simplified Release Process:** Automates the creation of releases, including tagging, building, and publishing to package indexes.
*   **GitHub Actions Integration:** Seamlessly integrates with GitHub Actions for continuous integration and continuous delivery (CI/CD) pipelines.

## GitHub Actions Integration

Using the Python Semantic Release GitHub Action simplifies your release process within your CI/CD pipeline.  It executes the command `semantic-release version` using `python-semantic-release`.
