<sup>¹ PyPy & GraalPy are only supported for manylinux wheels.</sup><br>
<sup>² Windows arm64 support is experimental.</sup><br>
<sup>³ Free-threaded mode requires opt-in on 3.13 using [`enable`](https://cibuildwheel.pypa.io/en/stable/options/#enable).</sup><br>
<sup>⁴ Experimental, not yet supported on PyPI, but can be used directly in web deployment. Use `--platform pyodide` to build.</sup><br>
<sup>⁵ manylinux armv7l support is experimental. As there are no RHEL based image for this architecture, it's using an Ubuntu based image instead.</sup><br>

## Usage

`cibuildwheel` is designed to be run within your CI/CD environment.  Supported platforms vary by CI provider:

|                 | Linux | macOS | Windows | Linux ARM | macOS ARM | Windows ARM | Android | iOS |
|-----------------|-------|-------|---------|-----------|-----------|-------------|---------|-----|
| GitHub Actions  | ✅    | ✅    | ✅       | ✅        | ✅        | ✅²         | ✅⁴      | ✅³  |
| Azure Pipelines | ✅    | ✅    | ✅       |           | ✅        | ✅²         | ✅⁴      | ✅³  |
| Travis CI       | ✅    |       | ✅      | ✅        |           |             | ✅⁴      |     |
| CircleCI        | ✅    | ✅    |         | ✅        | ✅        |             | ✅⁴      | ✅³  |
| Gitlab CI       | ✅    | ✅    | ✅      | ✅¹       | ✅        |             | ✅⁴      | ✅³  |
| Cirrus CI       | ✅    | ✅    | ✅      | ✅        | ✅        |             | ✅⁴      |      |

<sup>¹ [Requires emulation](https://cibuildwheel.pypa.io/en/stable/faq/#emulation), distributed separately. Other services may also support Linux ARM through emulation or third-party build hosts, but these are not tested in our CI.</sup><br>
<sup>² [Uses cross-compilation](https://cibuildwheel.pypa.io/en/stable/faq/#windows-arm64). It is not possible to test `arm64` on this CI platform.</sup><br>
<sup>³ Requires a macOS runner; runs tests on the simulator for the runner's architecture.</sup><br>
<sup>⁴ Building for Android requires the runner to be Linux x86_64, macOS ARM64 or macOS x86_64. Testing has [additional requirements](https://cibuildwheel.pypa.io/en/stable/platforms/#android).</sup><br>

## Example Setup (GitHub Actions)

Here's how to build manylinux, macOS, and Windows wheels with GitHub Actions:

```yaml
name: Build

on: [push, pull_request]

jobs:
  build_wheels:
    name: Build wheels on ${{ matrix.os }}
    runs-on: ${{ matrix.os }}
    strategy:
      matrix:
        os: [ubuntu-latest, ubuntu-24.04-arm, windows-latest, windows-11-arm, macos-13, macos-latest]

    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v4

      # Used to host cibuildwheel
      - uses: actions/setup-python@v5

      - name: Install cibuildwheel
        run: python -m pip install cibuildwheel==3.1.3

      - name: Build wheels
        run: python -m cibuildwheel --output-dir wheelhouse
        # to supply options, put them in 'env', like:
        # env:
        #   CIBW_SOME_OPTION: value
        #   ...

      - uses: actions/upload-artifact@v4
        with:
          name: cibw-wheels-${{ matrix.os }}-${{ strategy.job-index }}
          path: ./wheelhouse/*.whl
```

## Legal Note

`cibuildwheel` utilizes `delocate` or `auditwheel` for wheel repair, which may bundle dynamically linked libraries from the build environment.  This functionality is similar to static linking and may have license implications.  Review the licenses of any code included to ensure compliance.
