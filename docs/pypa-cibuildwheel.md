## Key Features

*   **Cross-Platform Compatibility:** Build wheels for macOS, Linux (including manylinux and musllinux), and Windows.
*   **Multiple Python Versions:** Supports a wide range of CPython, PyPy, and GraalPy versions, including 3.8 to 3.14.
*   **CI/CD Integration:** Seamlessly integrates with GitHub Actions, Azure Pipelines, Travis CI, CircleCI, GitLab CI, and Cirrus CI.
*   **Dependency Management:** Bundles shared library dependencies on Linux and macOS using auditwheel and delocate.
*   **Automated Testing:** Runs your library's tests against the wheel-installed version of your library.
*   **Android and iOS Support**: Experimental, but growing platform support for Android and iOS.

## What cibuildwheel Does

`cibuildwheel` simplifies the complex process of building Python wheels across various operating systems and Python versions. It automates the build and test process within your CI/CD system, ensuring your Python packages are compatible with a wide range of environments.  It supports the following platforms:

|                    | macOS Intel | macOS Apple Silicon | Windows 64bit | Windows 32bit | Windows Arm64 | manylinux<br/>musllinux x86_64 | manylinux<br/>musllinux i686 | manylinux<br/>musllinux aarch64 | manylinux<br/>musllinux ppc64le | manylinux<br/>musllinux s390x | manylinux<br/>musllinux armv7l | Android | iOS | Pyodide |

<sup>¹ PyPy & GraalPy are only supported for manylinux wheels.</sup><br>
<sup>² Windows arm64 support is experimental.</sup><br>
<sup>³ Free-threaded mode requires opt-in on 3.13 using [`enable`](https://cibuildwheel.pypa.io/en/stable/options/#enable).</sup><br>
<sup>⁴ Experimental, not yet supported on PyPI, but can be used directly in web deployment. Use `--platform pyodide` to build.</sup><br>
<sup>⁵ manylinux armv7l support is experimental. As there are no RHEL based image for this architecture, it's using an Ubuntu based image instead.</sup><br>

## Usage

To build wheels in your CI, see the [documentation](https://cibuildwheel.pypa.io) and the [examples](https://github.com/pypa/cibuildwheel/tree/main/examples).
