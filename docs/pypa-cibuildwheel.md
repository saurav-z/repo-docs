Tired of manually building and testing Python wheels across different operating systems and Python versions? **cibuildwheel simplifies the process by automating wheel builds for macOS, Linux, Windows, and more, on your CI server.**  Visit the original repository [here](https://github.com/pypa/cibuildwheel).

## Key Features

*   **Cross-Platform Compatibility:** Build wheels for macOS (Intel & Apple Silicon), Linux (manylinux, musllinux), Windows (32 & 64 bit, ARM64), Android, iOS, and Pyodide.
*   **Multiple Python Versions:** Supports building against various CPython, PyPy, and GraalPy versions.
*   **CI Integration:** Seamlessly integrates with popular CI services like GitHub Actions, Azure Pipelines, Travis CI, CircleCI, and GitLab CI.
*   **Dependency Handling:** Bundles shared library dependencies on Linux and macOS using `auditwheel` and `delocate`.
*   **Automated Testing:** Runs your library's tests against the wheel-installed version of your library.
*   **Flexible Configuration:** Offers extensive configuration options for build customization, testing, and debugging.
*   **Latest Python Support:**  Includes CPython 3.14 by default, including support for prerelease builds.

<sup>¹ PyPy & GraalPy are only supported for manylinux wheels.</sup><br>
<sup>² Windows arm64 support is experimental.</sup><br>
<sup>³ Free-threaded mode requires opt-in on 3.13 using [`enable`](https://cibuildwheel.pypa.io/en/stable/options/#enable).</sup><br>
<sup>⁴ Experimental, not yet supported on PyPI, but can be used directly in web deployment. Use `--platform pyodide` to build.</sup><br>
<sup>⁵ manylinux armv7l support is experimental. As there are no RHEL based image for this architecture, it's using an Ubuntu based image instead.</sup><br>

## Getting Started

`cibuildwheel` integrates directly into your CI workflow. See the [documentation](https://cibuildwheel.pypa.io) for detailed setup instructions and examples, or refer to the example `.github/workflows/wheels.yml` file in the original README.

## Example GitHub Actions Workflow

Here's a basic example of a GitHub Actions workflow using `cibuildwheel`:

```yaml
name: Build

on: [push, pull_request]

jobs:
  build_wheels:
    name: Build wheels on ${{ matrix.os }}
    runs-on: ${{ matrix.os }}
    strategy:
      matrix:
        os: [ubuntu-latest, ubuntu-24.04-arm, windows-latest, windows-11-arm, macos-13, macos-latest]

    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v4

      # Used to host cibuildwheel
      - uses: actions/setup-python@v5

      - name: Install cibuildwheel
        run: python -m pip install cibuildwheel==3.1.3

      - name: Build wheels
        run: python -m cibuildwheel --output-dir wheelhouse
        # to supply options, put them in 'env', like:
        # env:
        #   CIBW_SOME_OPTION: value
        #   ...

      - uses: actions/upload-artifact@v4
        with:
          name: cibw-wheels-${{ matrix.os }}-${{ strategy.job-index }}
          path: ./wheelhouse/*.whl
```
