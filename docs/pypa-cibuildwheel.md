## Key Features

*   **Cross-Platform Support:** Build wheels for macOS (Intel & Apple Silicon), Linux (manylinux & musllinux), Windows (64bit, 32bit, and Arm64), Android, iOS, and Pyodide, covering a wide range of architectures.
*   **Multiple Python Versions:** Supports building wheels for CPython, PyPy, and GraalPy across Python 3.8 - 3.14.
*   **CI/CD Integration:** Works seamlessly with GitHub Actions, Azure Pipelines, Travis CI, CircleCI, GitLab CI, and Cirrus CI.
*   **Dependency Handling:** Bundles shared library dependencies on Linux and macOS using `auditwheel` and `delocate`.
*   **Automated Testing:** Runs your library's tests against the wheel-installed version of your library.
*   **Customizable Builds:** Extensive options for controlling build platforms, Python versions, build environments, and testing.

## What cibuildwheel Does

cibuildwheel automates the complex process of building and testing Python wheels across various operating systems, architectures, and Python versions.  It simplifies your build process by running on your CI server to generate and test your wheels, making it easier to distribute your Python packages.

### Supported Platforms and Python Versions

<sup>¹ PyPy & GraalPy are only supported for manylinux wheels.</sup><br>
<sup>² Windows arm64 support is experimental.</sup><br>
<sup>³ Free-threaded mode requires opt-in on 3.13 using [`enable`](https://cibuildwheel.pypa.io/en/stable/options/#enable).</sup><br>
<sup>⁴ Experimental, not yet supported on PyPI, but can be used directly in web deployment. Use `--platform pyodide` to build.</sup><br>
<sup>⁵ manylinux armv7l support is experimental. As there are no RHEL based image for this architecture, it's using an Ubuntu based image instead.</sup><br>

## Usage

cibuildwheel is designed to be used within a CI/CD service. The supported platforms depend on the CI service you're using:

|                 | Linux | macOS | Windows | Linux ARM | macOS ARM | Windows ARM | Android | iOS |
|-----------------|-------|-------|---------|-----------|-----------|-------------|---------|-----|
| GitHub Actions  | ✅    | ✅    | ✅       | ✅        | ✅        | ✅²         | ✅⁴      | ✅³  |
| Azure Pipelines | ✅    | ✅    | ✅       |           | ✅        | ✅²         | ✅⁴      | ✅³  |
| Travis CI       | ✅    |       | ✅      | ✅        |           |             | ✅⁴      |     |
| CircleCI        | ✅    | ✅    |         | ✅        | ✅        |             | ✅⁴      | ✅³  |
| Gitlab CI       | ✅    | ✅    | ✅      | ✅¹       | ✅        |             | ✅⁴      | ✅³  |
| Cirrus CI       | ✅    | ✅    | ✅      | ✅        | ✅        |             | ✅⁴      |      |

<sup>¹ [Requires emulation](https://cibuildwheel.pypa.io/en/stable/faq/#emulation), distributed separately. Other services may also support Linux ARM through emulation or third-party build hosts, but these are not tested in our CI.</sup><br>
<sup>² [Uses cross-compilation](https://cibuildwheel.pypa.io/en/stable/faq/#windows-arm64). It is not possible to test `arm64` on this CI platform.</sup><br>
<sup>³ Requires a macOS runner; runs tests on the simulator for the runner's architecture.</sup><br>
<sup>⁴ Building for Android requires the runner to be Linux x86_64, macOS ARM64 or macOS x86_64. Testing has [additional requirements](https://cibuildwheel.pypa.io/en/stable/platforms/#android).</sup><br>

## Example Setup (GitHub Actions)

Here's an example `.github/workflows/wheels.yml` file to build wheels on GitHub Actions:

```yaml
name: Build

on: [push, pull_request]

jobs:
  build_wheels:
    name: Build wheels on ${{ matrix.os }}
    runs-on: ${{ matrix.os }}
    strategy:
      matrix:
        os: [ubuntu-latest, ubuntu-24.04-arm, windows-latest, windows-11-arm, macos-13, macos-latest]

    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v4

      # Used to host cibuildwheel
      - uses: actions/setup-python@v5

      - name: Install cibuildwheel
        run: python -m pip install cibuildwheel==3.1.3

      - name: Build wheels
        run: python -m cibuildwheel --output-dir wheelhouse
        # to supply options, put them in 'env', like:
        # env:
        #   CIBW_SOME_OPTION: value
        #   ...

      - uses: actions/upload-artifact@v4
        with:
          name: cibw-wheels-${{ matrix.os }}-${{ strategy.job-index }}
          path: ./wheelhouse/*.whl
```

For comprehensive information, including PyPI deployment details, and examples for different CI services, see the [official documentation](https://cibuildwheel.pypa.io) and the [examples](https://github.com/pypa/cibuildwheel/tree/main/examples).

## Legal Note

cibuildwheel repairs wheels with `delocate` or `auditwheel`, potentially bundling dynamically linked libraries from the build machine.  This may have license implications.  Check the licenses of any bundled code.
