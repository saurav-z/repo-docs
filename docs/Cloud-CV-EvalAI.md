EvalAI simplifies the evaluation and comparison of AI and machine learning algorithms, providing a centralized platform to host and participate in challenges. It addresses the challenges of inconsistent comparisons by offering standardized evaluation metrics and a streamlined submission process, boosting reproducibility and reliable analysis.

## Key Features

*   **Customizable Evaluation:** Define an arbitrary number of evaluation phases, dataset splits, and evaluation protocols.  Supports any programming language, and public and private leaderboards.
*   **Remote Evaluation:** Leverage specialized compute capabilities by adding your own worker nodes for resource-intensive challenges.
*   **Dockerized Evaluation:** Submit code as Docker images for evaluation within secure, isolated environments on the evaluation server.
*   **Command-Line Interface (CLI):**  Utilize the [`evalai-cli`](https://github.com/Cloud-CV/evalai-cli) to extend the platform's functionality to your command line, boosting accessibility.
*   **Scalable and Portable:** Built with open-source technologies like Docker, Django, Node.js, and PostgreSQL for scalability and portability.
*   **Faster Evaluation:** Optimized for speed by utilizing worker node pre-warming and dataset chunking.

## Goals

Our mission is to create a central, accessible platform for AI challenges, facilitating progress in the field by enabling researchers to easily benchmark their work.

## Installation

Get started with EvalAI quickly using Docker:

1.  **Install Docker and Docker Compose:** Follow the instructions for [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/install/) and [Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/).

2.  **Get the Source Code:** Clone the repository:

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/Cloud-CV/EvalAI.git evalai && cd evalai
    ```

3.  **Build and Run:** Build and start the Docker containers:

    ```bash
    docker-compose up --build
    ```

    *   To include worker services: `docker-compose --profile worker up --build`
    *   To include statsd-exporter: `docker-compose --profile statsd up --build`
    *   To include both optional services: `docker-compose --profile worker --profile statsd up --build`

4.  **Access EvalAI:** Open your web browser and go to  <http://127.0.0.1:8888>.

    *   **Superuser:** username: `admin`, password: `password`
    *   **Host User:** username: `host`, password: `password`
    *   **Participant User:** username: `participant`, password: `password`
