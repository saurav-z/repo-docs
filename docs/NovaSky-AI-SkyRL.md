# SkyRL: Your All-in-One Solution for LLM Reinforcement Learning

**SkyRL is a modular, full-stack reinforcement learning (RL) library designed to train long-horizon, real-world agents for Large Language Models (LLMs).**

## Key Features

*   **`skyagent`:** Agent layer for training long-horizon, real-world agents, including implementations for [SkyRL-v0](https://novasky-ai.notion.site/skyrl-v0).
*   **`skyrl-train` (NEW):** A modular and performant RL training framework.
*   **`skyrl-gym` (NEW):** A Gymnasium of tool-use tasks, including environments for math, coding, search, and SQL, implemented with the Gymnasium API.

## Getting Started

Explore SkyRL and its functionalities:

*   **Development Guide:**  Learn how to develop with SkyRL using the [Development Guide](https://skyrl.readthedocs.io/en/latest/getting-started/development.html) docs.
*   **Model Training:**  Use, modify, or build upon the SkyRL training stack with [`skyrl-train`](./skyrl-train). Get started with the [quickstart docs](https://skyrl.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html).
*   **Environment Building:** Integrate your tasks in a simple Gymnasium interface using [`skyrl-gym`](./skyrl-gym).
*   **Agentic Pipelines:** Optimize and scale pipelines for multi-turn tool use LLMs using [`skyagent`](./skyagent), built for long-horizon, real-environment tasks.
