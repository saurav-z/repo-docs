# SkyRL: Revolutionizing Reinforcement Learning for LLMs

SkyRL is a comprehensive, full-stack Reinforcement Learning (RL) library designed to empower researchers and developers to build and train advanced agents for Large Language Models (LLMs). Access the original repository here: [SkyRL GitHub](https://github.com/NovaSky-AI/SkyRL).

## Key Features

*   **Modular Training Framework (`skyrl-train`):** A high-performance, modular framework for RL training, enabling efficient experimentation and customization.
*   **Gymnasium Environments (`skyrl-gym`):**  A rich collection of tool-use tasks, including math, coding, search, and SQL environments, all integrated with the Gymnasium API for ease of use.
*   **Agent Layer (`skyagent`):**  Provides the tools for training long-horizon, real-world agents, supporting complex, multi-turn interactions.
*   **State-of-the-Art Performance:** SkyRL achieves impressive results, with models like SkyRL-SQL-7B outperforming GPT-4o and o4-mini.

## Getting Started

*   **Development Guide:**  Explore the [Development Guide](https://skyrl.readthedocs.io/en/latest/getting-started/development.html) for detailed instructions.
*   **Training:**  Get started with the SkyRL training stack by exploring [`skyrl-train`](./skyrl-train) and review the [quickstart docs](https://skyrl.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html).
*   **Environment Building:**  Easily integrate your custom tasks using the Gymnasium API through [`skyrl-gym`](./skyrl-gym).
*   **Agentic Pipelines:** Leverage [`skyagent`](./skyagent) for building and scaling agentic pipelines for multi-turn tool use with LLMs.
