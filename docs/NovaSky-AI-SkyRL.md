SkyRL is a powerful, modular, and full-stack reinforcement learning (RL) library designed to accelerate the training of large language models (LLMs) for complex, real-world tasks.

**Key Features:**

*   **`skyagent`**: Develop and train long-horizon, real-world agents. Includes code for [SkyRL-v0](https://novasky-ai.notion.site/skyrl-v0).
*   **`skyrl-train`**: A modular and high-performance training framework optimized for RL tasks.
*   **`skyrl-gym`**: A comprehensive suite of tool-use environments built on the Gymnasium API, including math, coding, search, and SQL environments.

## Getting Started

Dive into the world of SkyRL with these resources:

*   **Development Guide:**  Get started with our [Development Guide](https://skyrl.readthedocs.io/en/latest/getting-started/development.html) to learn how to build and integrate.
*   **Model Training:** Utilize the [`skyrl-train`](./skyrl-train) module to train your models.  Refer to our [quickstart docs](https://skyrl.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html) for a streamlined training experience.
*   **Environment Creation:**  Use [`skyrl-gym`](./skyrl-gym) to implement and integrate your own tasks using the user-friendly Gymnasium interface.
*   **Agentic Pipelines:** Explore [`skyagent`](./skyagent) for optimizing and scaling pipelines, specifically for multi-turn tool use LLMs on long-horizon tasks.
