SkyRL empowers researchers and developers to build and train advanced reinforcement learning (RL) agents for Large Language Models (LLMs) capable of handling real-world, long-horizon tasks.

## Key Features

*   **Modular Architecture:** SkyRL is designed with a modular approach, allowing for flexibility and customization in your RL projects.
*   **`skyagent`**:  Our agent layer for training long-horizon, real-world agents, including code for [SkyRL-v0](https://novasky-ai.notion.site/skyrl-v0).
*   **`skyrl-train`**: A modular, performant training framework for RL, offering a robust foundation for your RL training needs.
*   **`skyrl-gym`**:  A Gymnasium of tool-use environments, including math, coding, search, and SQL environments built on the Gymnasium API.
*   **Focus on Long-Horizon Tasks:** Optimized for training agents to solve complex, multi-turn tasks in real-world environments.
*   **Performance and Scalability:** Designed for efficient training and scaling of RL models.

## Getting Started
