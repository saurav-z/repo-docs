SkyRL is a comprehensive, full-stack reinforcement learning (RL) library designed to empower large language models (LLMs) for complex, real-world tasks.

**[Visit the original repository on GitHub](https://github.com/NovaSky-AI/SkyRL)**

## Key Features

*   **skyagent:** Train long-horizon, real-world agents with our agent layer.  Includes code for [SkyRL-v0](https://novasky-ai.notion.site/skyrl-v0).
*   **skyrl-train:** A modular and performant training framework for RL, perfect for experimentation and production.
*   **skyrl-gym:** A rich suite of tool-use environments built on the Gymnasium API, including math, coding, search, and SQL tasks.

## Getting Started

SkyRL offers a flexible and modular approach to RL for LLMs, with different entry points for different use cases:

*   **Development:** Explore the [Development Guide](https://skyrl.readthedocs.io/en/latest/getting-started/development.html) for in-depth information on contributing to SkyRL.
*   **Model Training:** Dive into `skyrl-train` to train your own RL models.  Consult the [quickstart docs](https://skyrl.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html) to get started.
*   **Environment Building:** Integrate your task into the Gymnasium API with `skyrl-gym`.
*   **Agentic Pipelines:** Utilize `skyagent` to optimize and scale pipelines for multi-turn tool-use LLMs tackling long-horizon, real-environment tasks.
