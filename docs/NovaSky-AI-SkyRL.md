SkyRL is a cutting-edge, full-stack Reinforcement Learning (RL) library designed to empower researchers and developers to build and train advanced agents for LLMs.

**Key Features:**

*   **`skyagent`**: Agent layer for training long-horizon, real-world agents.  Includes code for [SkyRL-v0](https://novasky-ai.notion.site/skyrl-v0).
*   **`skyrl-train`**: A modular and performant training framework tailored for RL.
*   **`skyrl-gym`**:  A Gymnasium API-compliant environment library featuring tool-use tasks including math, coding, search, and SQL environments.

## Getting Started

Dive into the world of SkyRL!

*   **Development Guide**: Explore our [Development Guide](https://skyrl.readthedocs.io/en/latest/getting-started/development.html) for detailed instructions.
*   **Model Training**: Start training with `skyrl-train` by checking out the [quickstart docs](https://skyrl.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html).
*   **Environment Building**: Integrate your custom tasks with the Gymnasium API using `skyrl-gym`.
*   **Agentic Pipelines**: Optimize and scale your multi-turn tool use LLMs with `skyagent`.
