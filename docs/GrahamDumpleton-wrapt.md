# Wrapt: Python Decorators, Wrappers, and Monkey Patching â€“ Made Easy

**Wrapt** is a powerful Python module that simplifies the creation of decorators, wrappers, and supports monkey patching, ensuring your code is cleaner, more maintainable, and performs optimally. ([View on GitHub](https://github.com/GrahamDumpleton/wrapt))

## Key Features of Wrapt

*   **Universal Decorators:** Works seamlessly with functions, methods (instance, class), classmethods, staticmethods, and even classes themselves.
*   **Transparent Object Proxies:** Provides advanced wrapping capabilities for complex scenarios.
*   **Safe Monkey Patching Utilities:**  Modify your code at runtime with confidence.
*   **Optimized Performance:** Leverages a C extension for performance-critical components, with a Python fallback for broad compatibility.
*   **Introspection Preservation:** Maintains function signatures, annotations, and other critical information for robust debugging and code understanding.
*   **Thread-Safe Decorator Implementations:** Ensures safe operation in multi-threaded environments.

## Why Use Wrapt?

Unlike other decorator implementations, Wrapt goes beyond `functools.wraps()` to guarantee that decorators preserve introspectability, signatures, and type checking. This leads to more predictable and consistent behavior, making it an ideal choice for production environments.

## Installation

Install Wrapt easily using pip:

```bash
pip install wrapt
```

## Examples

### Basic Decorator

```python
import wrapt

@wrapt.decorator
def pass_through(wrapped, instance, args, kwargs):
    return wrapped(*args, **kwargs)

@pass_through
def function():
    pass
```

### Decorator with Arguments

```python
import wrapt

def with_arguments(myarg1, myarg2):
    @wrapt.decorator
    def wrapper(wrapped, instance, args, kwargs):
        print(f"Arguments: {myarg1}, {myarg2}")
        return wrapped(*args, **kwargs)
    return wrapper

@with_arguments(1, 2)
def function():
    pass
```

### Universal Decorator

```python
import inspect
import wrapt

@wrapt.decorator
def universal(wrapped, instance, args, kwargs):
    if instance is None:
        if inspect.isclass(wrapped):
            # Decorator was applied to a class
            print("Decorating a class")
        else:
            # Decorator was applied to a function or staticmethod
            print("Decorating a function")
    else:
        if inspect.isclass(instance):
            # Decorator was applied to a classmethod
            print("Decorating a classmethod")
        else:
            # Decorator was applied to an instancemethod
            print("Decorating an instance method")
    
    return wrapped(*args, **kwargs)
```
