---

opendbc is a Python API that gives you unprecedented control over your vehicle, enabling advanced features like automated driving and vehicle management.  Developed to support the [openpilot](https://github.com/commaai/openpilot) project, it provides a robust foundation for interacting with your car's systems.

**Key Features:**

*   üöó **Comprehensive Car Control:** Control steering, gas, and brakes.
*   üö¶ **Real-time Data Access:** Read vehicle speed, steering angle, and more.
*   üåê **Wide Car Support:** Compatible with a growing list of vehicles (primarily post-2016 models with LKAS and ACC).  Check the [supported cars list](docs/CARS.md).
*   ‚öôÔ∏è **Easy Integration:** Python API for seamless integration with your projects.
*   üõ†Ô∏è **Extensible:** Easily add support for new car models and features.
*   üõ°Ô∏è **Safety-Focused:** Robust safety features for reliable operation.

## Getting Started

Follow these steps to quickly get opendbc up and running:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/commaai/opendbc.git
cd opendbc

# Run a complete build and test suite
./test.sh

# Install dependencies manually
pip3 install -e .[testing,docs]
scons -j8
pytest .
lefthook run lint
```

Example programs in the [`examples/`](examples/) directory demonstrate how to read car state and control various functions, including the [`examples/joystick.py`](examples/joystick.py) script, which allows control via a joystick.

## Project Structure

*   [`opendbc/dbc/`](opendbc/dbc/): Stores [DBC](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CAN_bus#DBC) files.
*   [`opendbc/can/`](opendbc/can/): Library for parsing and building CAN messages from DBC files.
*   [`opendbc/car/`](opendbc/car/): High-level library for interacting with cars using Python.
*   [`opendbc/safety/`](opendbc/safety/): Functional safety components for supported cars.

## How to Contribute: Adding Car Support

Want to add support for your car?  Follow these steps to get started:

### 1. Connect to the Car

*   Use a [comma 3X](https://comma.ai/shop/comma-3x) and a compatible car harness. If one doesn't exist, you can create your own with a "developer harness".

### 2.  Port Structure

*   A car port is located in `opendbc/car/<brand>/`.
*   Includes: `carstate.py`, `carcontroller.py`, `<brand>can.py`, `fingerprints.py`, `interface.py`, `radar_interface.py`, and `values.py`.

### 3. Reverse Engineer CAN Messages

*   Record a route with various LKAS and ACC actions.
*   Load the route in [cabana](https://github.com/commaai/openpilot/tree/master/tools/cabana) to analyze CAN data.

### 4. Tuning

*   Use the [longitudinal maneuvers](https://github.com/commaai/openpilot/tree/master/tools/longitudinal_maneuvers) tool to test and tune longitudinal control.

## Contributing

opendbc thrives on community contributions.  Get involved through GitHub and the [Discord](https://discord.comma.ai) server. Check out the `#dev-opendbc-cars` channel.

### Roadmap

*   [ ] `pip install opendbc`
*   [ ] 100% type coverage
*   [ ] 100% line coverage
*   [ ] Make car ports easier: refactors, tools, tests, and docs
*   [ ] Expose the state of all supported cars better: https://github.com/commaai/opendbc/issues/1144
*   [ ] Extend support to every car with LKAS + ACC interfaces
*   [ ] Automatic lateral and longitudinal control/tuning evaluation
*   [ ] Auto-tuning for [lateral](https://blog.comma.ai/090release/#torqued-an-auto-tuner-for-lateral-control) and longitudinal control
*   [ ] [Automatic Emergency Braking](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Automated_emergency_braking_system)

## Safety Model

opendbc's safety features are designed to work with [openpilot](https://github.com/commaai/openpilot) and [panda](https://comma.ai/shop/panda). The opendbc safety firmware starts in `SAFETY_SILENT` mode and can only send messages after a safety mode is selected.

## Code Quality & Rigor

The project uses the following to ensure code quality:

*   Static code analysis with [cppcheck](https://github.com/danmar/cppcheck/)
*   [MISRA C:2012](https://misra.org.uk/) compliance checking
*   Strict compiler flags (-Wall, -Wextra, -Wstrict-prototypes, -Werror)
*   Unit tests for safety logic
*   Mutation testing on MISRA coverage
*   100% line coverage on safety unit tests
*   [Ruff linter](https://github.com/astral-sh/ruff) and [mypy](https://mypy-lang.org/) for the car interface library
