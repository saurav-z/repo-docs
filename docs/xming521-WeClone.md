## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
*   CUDA (version 12.6 or above)
*   Python 3.10+
*   Recommended: [uv](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/) for dependency management

### Environment Setup

1.  **Install Dependencies:**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/xming521/WeClone.git && cd WeClone
    uv venv .venv --python=3.10
    source .venv/bin/activate # windows .venv\Scripts\activate
    uv pip install --group main -e .
    ```
2.  **Configure:** Copy `examples/tg.template.jsonc` to `settings.jsonc` and modify for your needs.
3.  **Verify CUDA (Optional):**
    ```bash
    python -c "import torch; print('CUDA Available:', torch.cuda.is_available());"
    ```
4.  **(Optional) Accelerate:** `uv pip install flash-attn --no-build-isolation`

### Model and Data Preparation

1.  **Download a Model:**  Recommended to use [Hugging Face](https://huggingface.co/docs/hub/models-downloading).

    ```bash
    git lfs install
    git clone https://huggingface.co/Qwen/Qwen2.5-VL-7B-Instruct models/Qwen2.5-VL-7B-Instruct
    ```

2.  **Prepare Chat Data:** Export your chat history (Telegram via Desktop, WeChat is also supported) and place them in `./dataset/telegram` directory.
3.  **Data Preprocessing:** Modify configurations in `settings.jsonc` and run:
    ```bash
    weclone-cli make-dataset
    ```

### Fine-tuning and Inference
1.  **Configure Parameters:** Adjust `model_name_or_path`, `template`, `lora_target` in `settings.jsonc`.
2.  **Single GPU Training:**
    ```bash
    weclone-cli train-sft
    ```
3.  **Multi-GPU Training:**  Uncomment `deepspeed` line and run:
    ```bash
    uv pip install deepspeed
    deepspeed --num_gpus=number_of_gpus weclone/train/train_sft.py
    ```

4.  **Simple Inference with Browser Demo:**
    ```bash
    weclone-cli webchat-demo
    ```

5.  **API Inference:**
    ```bash
    weclone-cli server
    ```

6.  **Test with Common Chat Questions:**
    ```bash
    weclone-cli server
    weclone-cli test-model
    ```

## Results Showcase

[Include some results screenshots here]
**Using the Qwen2.5VL 32B model with approximately 10,000 processed effective data samples, the loss was reduced to around 3.6:**

## Deploy to Chat Bots

### AstrBot

*   Follow steps to deploy [AstrBot](https://github.com/AstrBotDevs/AstrBot)
*   Follow steps to deploy messaging platforms like Discord, Telegram, Slack in AstrBot
*   Execute `weclone-cli server` to start the API service
*   Add a new service provider in AstrBot, select OpenAI type, fill in the API Base URL according to AstrBot's deployment method (e.g., for docker deployment it might be http://172.17.0.1:8005/v1), fill in the model as gpt-3.5-turbo, and enter any API Key
*   Tool calling is not supported after fine-tuning, please turn off the default tools first by sending the command: `/tool off_all` on the messaging platform, otherwise the fine-tuned effect won't be visible.
*   Set the system prompt in AstrBot according to the default_system used during fine-tuning.

>   [IMPORTANT]
>   Check the api_service logs to ensure that the large model service request parameters are consistent with those used during fine-tuning as much as possible, and turn off all tool plugin capabilities.

### LangBot

*   Follow steps to deploy [LangBot](https://github.com/RockChinQ/LangBot/blob/master/README_EN.md#-getting-started)
*   Add a bot (Discord, Telegram, Slack, Lark e.g.) in LangBot
*   Execute `weclone-cli server` to start the WeClone API service
*   Add a new model in the model page, name it `gpt-3.5-turbo`, select OpenAI as the provider, fill in the request URL as WeClone's address. For detailed connection methods, refer to the [documentation](https://docs.langbot.app/en/workshop/network-details.html), and enter any API Key.
