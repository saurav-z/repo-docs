## Getting Started

### Environment Setup

1.  **CUDA Installation:**  (Skip if already installed and ensure version 12.6 or above)
2.  **Dependency Management:** Use [uv](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/) for fast Python environment management.
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/xming521/WeClone.git && cd WeClone
    uv venv .venv --python=3.10
    source .venv/bin/activate # windows .venv\Scripts\activate
    uv pip install --group main -e .
    ```
3.  **Configuration:** Copy and rename the configuration template.
    ```bash
    cp examples/tg.template.jsonc settings.jsonc
    ```
    > [!NOTE]
    > All training and inference settings are managed in `settings.jsonc`.

4.  **CUDA Verification (optional):**  Confirm CUDA is correctly set up.
    ```bash
    python -c "import torch; print('CUDA Available:', torch.cuda.is_available());"
    ```
5.  **(Optional) FlashAttention:** Install for improved performance.
    ```bash
    uv pip install flash-attn --no-build-isolation
    ```

### Model Download

Download models using [Hugging Face](https://huggingface.co/docs/hub/models-downloading) or:

```bash
git lfs install
git clone https://huggingface.co/Qwen/Qwen2.5-VL-7B-Instruct models/Qwen2.5-VL-7B-Instruct
```

### Data Preparation

1.  **Export Chat Records:** Use [Telegram Desktop](https://desktop.telegram.org/) to export chat history. Select "Photos" for message types and "JSON" for format.
2.  **Directory Structure:** Place exported `ChatExport_*` folders in the `./dataset/telegram` directory.

### Data Preprocessing

1.  **Configuration:** Modify `language`, `platform`, and `include_type` in `settings.jsonc`.
2.  **Telegram Specific:** Set your Telegram user ID in `telegram_args.my_id` within `settings.jsonc`.
3.  **Privacy Filtering:**  WeClone uses Microsoft Presidio to filter PII.  You can add custom filters in `blocked_words` in `settings.jsonc`.

    > [!IMPORTANT]
    > üö®  Protect your personal information!

4.  **Run Preprocessing:** Execute the following command. Adjust parameters in `make_dataset_args` in `settings.jsonc` as needed.
    ```bash
    weclone-cli make-dataset
    ```
    More Parameter Details: [Data Preprocessing](https://docs.weclone.love/docs/deploy/data_preprocessing.html#related-parameters)

### Model Fine-tuning and Inference

*   **(Optional) Model Selection:** Modify `model_name_or_path`, `template`, and `lora_target` in `settings.jsonc` to select different models.
*   **VRAM Management:** Adjust `per_device_train_batch_size` and `gradient_accumulation_steps` in `settings.jsonc`.
*   **Training Parameters:** Configure `num_train_epochs`, `lora_rank`, and `lora_dropout` in `train_sft_args` based on your dataset.

#### Single GPU Training

```bash
weclone-cli train-sft
```

#### Multi-GPU Training

Uncomment the `deepspeed` line in `settings.jsonc` and run:

```bash
uv pip install deepspeed
deepspeed --num_gpus=number_of_gpus weclone/train/train_sft.py
```

#### Browser Demo for Simple Inference

Test temperature and top_p, and then modify the `infer_args` in settings.jsonc for future inference:

```bash
weclone-cli webchat-demo
```

#### API Inference

```bash
weclone-cli server
```

#### Test with Common Chat Questions

Tests daily conversation test results in `test_result-my.txt`

```bash
weclone-cli server
weclone-cli test-model
```

## Results Showcase

> [!TIP]
> **Share your WeClone results with native English speakers on Twitter! More examples can be found on [XiaoHongShu](https://www.xiaohongshu.com/user/profile/628109730000000021029de4).**

Using the Qwen2.5VL 32B model with approximately 10,000 processed effective data samples, the loss was reduced to around 3.6:

## Deploy to Chat Bots

### AstrBot

[AstrBot](https://github.com/AstrBotDevs/AstrBot) is an easy-to-use multi-platform LLM chatbot and development framework ‚ú® Supports Discord, Telegram, Slack, QQ, WeChat, Enterprise WeChat, Feishu and other platforms.

Usage steps:

1.  Deploy AstrBot
2.  Deploy messaging platforms like Discord, Telegram, Slack in AstrBot
3.  Execute `weclone-cli server` to start the API service
4.  Add a new service provider in AstrBot, select OpenAI type, fill in the API Base URL according to AstrBot's deployment method (e.g., for docker deployment it might be http://172.17.0.1:8005/v1), fill in the model as gpt-3.5-turbo, and enter any API Key
5.  Tool calling is not supported after fine-tuning, please turn off the default tools first by sending the command: `/tool off_all` on the messaging platform, otherwise the fine-tuned effect won't be visible.
6.  Set the system prompt in AstrBot according to the default_system used during fine-tuning.

![5](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/19de7072-076a-4cdf-8ae6-46b9b89f536a)

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Check the api_service logs to ensure that the large model service request parameters are consistent with those used during fine-tuning as much as possible, and turn off all tool plugin capabilities.

### LangBot

[LangBot](https://github.com/RockChinQ/LangBot) is an open-source LLM chatbot platform that connects to various global instant messaging platforms, suitable for various scenarios.

1.  [Deploy LangBot](https://github.com/RockChinQ/LangBot/blob/master/README_EN.md#-getting-started)
2.  Add a robot in LangBot
3.  Add a new model in the model page, name it `gpt-3.5-turbo`, select OpenAI as the provider, fill in the request URL as WeClone's address. For detailed connection methods, refer to the [documentation](https://docs.langbot.app/en/workshop/network-details.html), and enter any API Key.
