# OpenCLIP: Open Source Implementation of CLIP for Image-Text Understanding

OpenCLIP provides an open-source implementation of CLIP (Contrastive Language-Image Pre-training), enabling researchers and developers to build powerful image-text models.

*   **Key Features:**
    *   **Reproducible Research:** Train and evaluate models using a variety of datasets and compute budgets.
    *   **Pre-trained Models:** Access a comprehensive collection of pre-trained models trained on datasets like LAION-400M, LAION-2B, and DataComp-1B.  Explore the Hugging Face Hub for model cards and details.
    *   **Flexible Training:**  Train custom CLIP models using the provided training scripts, supporting multi-GPU and distributed training.
    *   **Easy to Use:** Provides simple model interface to instantiate both pre-trained and untrained models.
    *   **Fine-tuning Capabilities:**  Fine-tune your CLIP models on downstream classification tasks with the WiSE-FT repository.
    *   **CoCa Support:** Train and use CoCa models for image-text generation.
    *   **Int8 Support:** Experimental int8 training and inference support for increased speed.
    *   **Remote Loading/Training:** Supports remote file systems like S3 for checkpoint loading and training.
    *   **Hugging Face Hub Integration:** Easily push and manage your trained models on the Hugging Face Hub.

## Getting Started

### Installation
```bash
pip install open_clip_torch
```
For training:
```bash
pip install 'open_clip_torch[training]'
```
### Basic Usage
```python
import torch
from PIL import Image
import open_clip

model, _, preprocess = open_clip.create_model_and_transforms('ViT-B-32', pretrained='laion2b_s34b_b79k')
model.eval()  # model in train mode by default, impacts some models with BatchNorm or stochastic depth active
tokenizer = open_clip.get_tokenizer('ViT-B-32')

image = preprocess(Image.open("docs/CLIP.png")).unsqueeze(0)
text = tokenizer(["a diagram", "a dog", "a cat"])

with torch.no_grad(), torch.autocast("cuda"):
    image_features = model.encode_image(image)
    text_features = model.encode_text(text)
    image_features /= image_features.norm(dim=-1, keepdim=True)
    text_features /= text_features.norm(dim=-1, keepdim=True)

    text_probs = (100.0 * image_features @ text_features.T).softmax(dim=-1)

print("Label probs:", text_probs)  # prints: [[1., 0., 0.]]
```
### Pretrained Models
```python
import open_clip
open_clip.list_pretrained()
```
More information is available on our [Pretrained Models documentation](docs/PRETRAINED.md).

### Training
Follow the instructions in the [Training](##Training CLIP) section of the original README for detailed instructions on setting up your environment and running training jobs, including multi-GPU and SLURM support.

### Fine-tuning & Evaluation
Use the provided scripts to fine-tune your models on downstream tasks and evaluate their performance. See the [Evaluation / Zero-Shot](##Evaluation / Zero-Shot) and [Fine-tuning on classification tasks](##Fine-tuning on classification tasks) sections for more information.
