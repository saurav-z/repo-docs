Key enhancements include:

*   Unified LLM Wrappers:  Seamless integration with Hugging Face models and vLLM inference engines
*   Conversation Management: Advanced [`History`](torchrl/data/llm/history.py) class for multi-turn dialogue with automatic chat template detection
*   Tool Integration: [Built-in support](torchrl/envs/llm/transforms/) for Python code execution, function calling, and custom tool transforms
*   Specialized Objectives: [GRPO](torchrl/objectives/llm/grpo.py) (Group Relative Policy Optimization) and [SFT](torchrl/objectives/llm/sft.py) loss functions optimized for language models
*   High-Performance Collectors: [Async data collection](torchrl/collectors/llm/) with distributed training support
*   Flexible Environments: Transform-based architecture for reward computation, data loading, and conversation augmentation

```python
from torchrl.envs.llm import ChatEnv
from torchrl.modules.llm import TransformersWrapper
from torchrl.objectives.llm import GRPOLoss
from torchrl.collectors.llm import LLMCollector

# Create environment with Python tool execution
env = ChatEnv(
    tokenizer=tokenizer,
    system_prompt="You are an assistant that can execute Python code.",
    batch_size=[1]
).append_transform(PythonInterpreter())

# Wrap your language model
llm = TransformersWrapper(
    model=model,
    tokenizer=tokenizer,
    input_mode="history"
)

# Set up GRPO training
loss_fn = GRPOLoss(llm, critic, gamma=0.99)
collector = LLMCollector(env, llm, frames_per_batch=100)

# Training loop
for data in collector:
    loss = loss_fn(data)
    loss.backward()
    optimizer.step()
```

## Design Principles

*   üî• **PyTorch Ecosystem Alignment:** Structured to follow popular PyTorch library conventions (e.g., datasets, transforms, models, data utilities).
*   ‚ûñ **Minimal Dependencies:**  Requires only the Python standard library, NumPy, and PyTorch, with optional dependencies for common environment libraries and datasets.

## Writing simplified and portable RL codebase with `TensorDict`

TorchRL solves this problem through [`TensorDict`](https://github.com/pytorch/tensordict/),
a convenient data structure<sup>(1)</sup> that can be used to streamline one's
RL codebase.
With this tool, one can write a *complete PPO training script in less than 100
lines of code*!

`TensorDict` makes it easy to re-use pieces of code across environments, models and
algorithms.
  <details>
    <summary>Code</summary>
  
  For instance, here's how to code a rollout in TorchRL:

  ```diff
  - obs, done = env.reset()
  + tensordict = env.reset()
  policy = SafeModule(
      model,
      in_keys=["observation_pixels", "observation_vector"],
      out_keys=["action"],
  )
  out = []
  for i in range(n_steps):
  -     action, log_prob = policy(obs)
  -     next_obs, reward, done, info = env.step(action)
  -     out.append((obs, next_obs, action, log_prob, reward, done))
  -     obs = next_obs
  +     tensordict = policy(tensordict)
  +     tensordict = env.step(tensordict)
  +     out.append(tensordict)
  +     tensordict = step_mdp(tensordict)  # renames next_observation_* keys to observation_*
  - obs, next_obs, action, log_prob, reward, done = [torch.stack(vals, 0) for vals in zip(*out)]
  + out = torch.stack(out, 0)  # TensorDict supports multiple tensor operations
  ```
  </details>

Using this, TorchRL abstracts away the input / output signatures of the modules, env, 
collectors, replay buffers and losses of the library, allowing all primitives
to be easily recycled across settings.

  <details>
    <summary>Code</summary>

  Here's another example of an off-policy training loop in TorchRL (assuming 
  that a data collector, a replay buffer, a loss and an optimizer have been instantiated):
  
  ```diff
  - for i, (obs, next_obs, action, hidden_state, reward, done) in enumerate(collector):
  + for i, tensordict in enumerate(collector):
  -     replay_buffer.add((obs, next_obs, action, log_prob, reward, done))
  +     replay_buffer.add(tensordict)
      for j in range(num_optim_steps):
  -         obs, next_obs, action, hidden_state, reward, done = replay_buffer.sample(batch_size)
  -         loss = loss_fn(obs, next_obs, action, hidden_state, reward, done)
  +         tensordict = replay_buffer.sample(batch_size)
  +         loss = loss_fn(tensordict)
          loss.backward()
          optim.step()
          optim.zero_grad()
  ```
  This training loop can be re-used across algorithms as it makes a minimal number of assumptions about the structure of the data.
  </details>

  TensorDict supports multiple tensor operations on its device and shape
  (the shape of TensorDict, or its batch size, is the common arbitrary N first dimensions of all its contained tensors):

  <details>
    <summary>Code</summary>

  ```python
  # stack and cat
  tensordict = torch.stack(list_of_tensordicts, 0)
  tensordict = torch.cat(list_of_tensordicts, 0)
  # reshape
  tensordict = tensordict.view(-1)
  tensordict = tensordict.permute(0, 2, 1)
  tensordict = tensordict.unsqueeze(-1)
  tensordict = tensordict.squeeze(-1)
  # indexing
  tensordict = tensordict[:2]
  tensordict[:, 2] = sub_tensordict
  # device and memory location
  tensordict.cuda()
  tensordict.to("cuda:1")
  tensordict.share_memory_()
  ```
  </details>

TensorDict comes with a dedicated [`tensordict.nn`](https://pytorch.github.io/tensordict/reference/nn.html)
module that contains everything you might need to write your model with it.
And it is `functorch` and `torch.compile` compatible!

  <details>
    <summary>Code</summary>

  ```diff
  transformer_model = nn.Transformer(nhead=16, num_encoder_layers=12)
  + td_module = SafeModule(transformer_model, in_keys=["src", "tgt"], out_keys=["out"])
  src = torch.rand((10, 32, 512))
  tgt = torch.rand((20, 32, 512))
  + tensordict = TensorDict({"src": src, "tgt": tgt}, batch_size=[20, 32])
  - out = transformer_model(src, tgt)
  + td_module(tensordict)
  + out = tensordict["out"]
  ```

  The `TensorDictSequential` class allows to branch sequences of `nn.Module` instances in a highly modular way.
  For instance, here is an implementation of a transformer using the encoder and decoder blocks:
  ```python
  encoder_module = TransformerEncoder(...)
  encoder = TensorDictSequential(encoder_module, in_keys=["src", "src_mask"], out_keys=["memory"])
  decoder_module = TransformerDecoder(...)
  decoder = TensorDictModule(decoder_module, in_keys=["tgt", "memory"], out_keys=["output"])
  transformer = TensorDictSequential(encoder, decoder)
  assert transformer.in_keys == ["src", "src_mask", "tgt"]
  assert transformer.out_keys == ["memory", "output"]
  ```

  `TensorDictSequential` allows to isolate subgraphs by querying a set of desired input / output keys:
  ```python
  transformer.select_subsequence(out_keys=["memory"])  # returns the encoder
  transformer.select_subsequence(in_keys=["tgt", "memory"])  # returns the decoder
  ```
  </details>
