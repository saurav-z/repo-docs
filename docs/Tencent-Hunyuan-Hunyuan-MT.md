**Prompts:**

*   **ZH<=>XX Translation:**
    ```
    Êää‰∏ãÈù¢ÁöÑÊñáÊú¨ÁøªËØëÊàê<target_language>Ôºå‰∏çË¶ÅÈ¢ùÂ§ñËß£Èáä„ÄÇ

    <source_text>
    ```
*   **XX<=>XX Translation (excluding ZH):**
    ```
    Translate the following segment into <target_language>, without additional explanation.

    <source_text>
    ```
*   **Hunyuan-MT-Chimera-7B:**
    ```
    Analyze the following multiple <target_language> translations of the <source_language> segment surrounded in triple backticks and generate a single refined <target_language> translation. Only output the refined translation, do not explain.

    The <source_language> segment:
    ```<source_text>```

    The multiple `<target_language>` translations:
    1. ```<translated_text1>```
    2. ```<translated_text2>```
    3. ```<translated_text3>```
    4. ```<translated_text4>```
    5. ```<translated_text5>```
    6. ```<translated_text6>```
    ```

**Usage with Transformers:**

```python
from transformers import AutoModelForCausalLM, AutoTokenizer

model_name_or_path = "tencent/Hunyuan-MT-7B"

tokenizer = AutoTokenizer.from_pretrained(model_name_or_path)
model = AutoModelForCausalLM.from_pretrained(model_name_or_path, device_map="auto")

messages = [
    {"role": "user", "content": "Translate the following segment into Chinese, without additional explanation.\n\nIt‚Äôs on the house."},
]
tokenized_chat = tokenizer.apply_chat_template(
    messages,
    tokenize=True,
    add_generation_prompt=False,
    return_tensors="pt"
)

outputs = model.generate(tokenized_chat.to(model.device), max_new_tokens=2048)
output_text = tokenizer.decode(outputs[0])
```

*Recommended Inference Parameters:*

```json
{
  "top_k": 20,
  "top_p": 0.6,
  "repetition_penalty": 1.05,
  "temperature": 0.7

messages = [
    {"role": "system", "content": "You are a helpful assistant."},
    {"role": "user", "content": "Why is seawater salty?" },
    {"role": "assistant", "content": "Seawater is primarily saline due to dissolved salts and minerals... Therefore, the salinity of seawater is determined by the amount of salts and minerals it contains."}
]
from transformers import AutoTokenizer
tokenizer = AutoTokenizer.from_pretrained("your_tokenizer_path", trust_remote_code=True)
train_ids = tokenizer.apply_chat_template(messages)
```

**Fine-tuning with LLaMA-Factory:**

*   Follow the [LLaMA-Factory Installation Guide](https://github.com/hiyouga/LLaMA-Factory)
*   Prepare your data in a `sharegpt` format.
*   Define your dataset in `data/dataset_info.json`.
*   Copy the configuration files from `llama_factory_support/example_configs` to `example/hunyuan`.
*   Modify the model path and dataset name in `hunyuan_full.yaml`.
*   Execute training commands (single-node or multi-node).  See original README for exact commands.

**Quantization Compression:**

*   Utilize [AngelSlim](https://github.com/tencent/AngelSlim) to create FP8 and INT4 quantized models.

**Deployment:**

*   **TensorRT-LLM:**  Follow instructions for docker image and API setup.
*   **vLLM:**  See instructions for setting up the API server with different quantization options (BF16, INT8, INT4, FP8).
*   **SGLang:** See instructions for setting up the API server.
