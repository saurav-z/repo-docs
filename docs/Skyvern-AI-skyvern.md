**Ready to get started?**

```bash
pip install skyvern
skyvern quickstart
```

Run the UI with:
```bash
skyvern run all
```

Or run the tasks with code:
```python
from skyvern import Skyvern

skyvern = Skyvern()
task = await skyvern.run_task(prompt="Find the top post on hackernews today")
print(task)
```

## How Skyvern Works

Skyvern leverages a swarm of agents powered by LLMs and computer vision, similar to BabyAGI and AutoGPT, but with the added ability to interact directly with websites using browser automation.  This allows it to understand and execute actions on websites without the need for custom scripts.

See the detailed system diagram and technical report [here](https://blog.skyvern.com/skyvern-2-0-state-of-the-art-web-navigation-with-85-8-on-webvoyager-eval/).

## Performance & Evaluation

Skyvern achieves SOTA performance on the [WebBench benchmark](webbench.ai) with a 64.4% accuracy and excels at WRITE tasks (like filling out forms, logging in, downloading files, etc.).

See the full WebBench evaluation and results at [here](https://blog.skyvern.com/web-bench-a-new-way-to-compare-ai-browser-agents/).

## Advanced Usage

### Control your own browser (Chrome)

1.  Just With Python Code

```python
from skyvern import Skyvern

# The path to your Chrome browser. This example path is for Mac.
browser_path = "/Applications/Google Chrome.app/Contents/MacOS/Google Chrome"
skyvern = Skyvern(
    base_url="http://localhost:8000",
    api_key="YOUR_API_KEY",
    browser_path=browser_path,
)
task = await skyvern.run_task(
    prompt="Find the top post on hackernews today",
)
```

2.  With Skyvern Service

Add two variables to your .env file:
```bash
# The path to your Chrome browser. This example path is for Mac.
CHROME_EXECUTABLE_PATH="/Applications/Google Chrome.app/Contents/MacOS/Google Chrome"
BROWSER_TYPE=cdp-connect
```

Restart Skyvern service `skyvern run all` and run the task through UI or code

### Run Skyvern with any remote browser

Grab the cdp connection url and pass it to Skyvern

```python
from skyvern import Skyvern

skyvern = Skyvern(cdp_url="your cdp connection url")
task = await skyvern.run_task(
    prompt="Find the top post on hackernews today",
)
```

### Get consistent output schema from your run

You can do this by adding the `data_extraction_schema` parameter:

```python
from skyvern import Skyvern

skyvern = Skyvern()
task = await skyvern.run_task(
    prompt="Find the top post on hackernews today",
    data_extraction_schema={
        "type": "object",
        "properties": {
            "title": {
                "type": "string",
                "description": "The title of the top post"
            },
            "url": {
                "type": "string",
                "description": "The URL of the top post"
            },
            "points": {
                "type": "integer",
                "description": "Number of points the post has received"
            }
        }
    }
)
```

## Skyvern Features

### Skyvern Tasks
Tasks are the fundamental building block inside Skyvern. Each task is a single request to Skyvern, instructing it to navigate through a website and accomplish a specific goal.

Tasks require you to specify a `url`, `prompt`, and can optionally include a `data schema` (if you want the output to conform to a specific schema) and `error codes` (if you want Skyvern to stop running in specific situations).

</p>


### Skyvern Workflows
Workflows are a way to chain multiple tasks together to form a cohesive unit of work.

For example, if you wanted to download all invoices newer than January 1st, you could create a workflow that first navigated to the invoices page, then filtered down to only show invoices newer than January 1st, extracted a list of all eligible invoices, and iterated through each invoice to download it.

Another example is if you wanted to automate purchasing products from an e-commerce store, you could create a workflow that first navigated to the desired product, then added it to a cart. Second, it would navigate to the cart and validate the cart state. Finally, it would go through the checkout process to purchase the items.

Supported workflow features include:
1. Navigation
1. Action
1. Data Extraction
1. Loops
1. File parsing
1. Uploading files to block storage
1. Sending emails
1. Text Prompts
1. Tasks (general)
1. (Coming soon) Conditionals
1. (Coming soon) Custom Code Block

<p align="center">
  <img src="fern/images/invoice_downloading_workflow_example.png"/>
</p>

### Livestreaming
Skyvern allows you to livestream the viewport of the browser to your local machine so that you can see exactly what Skyvern is doing on the web. This is useful for debugging and understanding how Skyvern is interacting with a website, and intervening when necessary

### Form Filling
Skyvern is natively capable of filling out form inputs on websites. Passing in information via the `navigation_goal` will allow Skyvern to comprehend the information and fill out the form accordingly.

### Data Extraction
Skyvern is also capable of extracting data from a website.

You can also specify a `data_extraction_schema` directly within the main prompt to tell Skyvern exactly what data you'd like to extract from the website, in jsonc format. Skyvern's output will be structured in accordance to the supplied schema.

### File Downloading
Skyvern is also capable of downloading files from a website. All downloaded files are automatically uploaded to block storage (if configured), and you can access them via the UI.

### Authentication
Skyvern supports a number of different authentication methods to make it easier to automate tasks behind a login. If you'd like to try it out, please reach out to us [via email](mailto:founders@skyvern.com) or [discord](https://discord.gg/fG2XXEuQX3).
