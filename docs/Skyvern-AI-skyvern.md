[Skyvern](https://github.com/Skyvern-AI/skyvern) empowers you to automate repetitive browser tasks with ease, using the latest advancements in AI.  Replace brittle automation solutions and unlock efficiency with Skyvern.

## Key Features:

*   üåê **Automated Web Navigation:** Navigate complex websites and interactions using LLMs and computer vision, no custom code needed.
*   ‚öôÔ∏è **Workflow Automation:** Create and chain multiple tasks together for complex automation, supporting loops, data extraction, and more.
*   üëÅÔ∏è **Visual Understanding:** Operates effectively on websites it has never seen before by mapping visual elements and actions.
*   üõ°Ô∏è **Resilient Automation:** Resistant to website layout changes; no reliance on fragile selectors like XPaths.
*   üìä **Data Extraction & Form Filling:** Extract structured data and fill forms seamlessly.
*   üîë **Authentication Support:** Supports multiple authentication methods including 2FA (TOTP), for automating tasks behind logins, and password manager integration.
*   üíª **Easy Integration:** Integrates with tools like Zapier, Make.com, and N8N, and supports the Model Context Protocol (MCP).
*   ‚òÅÔ∏è **Skyvern Cloud:** Try out the managed cloud version of Skyvern at [app.skyvern.com](https://app.skyvern.com)

## Quickstart

### 1. Install Skyvern

```bash
pip install skyvern
```

### 2. Run Skyvern

```bash
skyvern quickstart
```

### 3. Run Task

#### UI (Recommended)

```bash
skyvern run all
```

Access the UI at [http://localhost:8080](http://localhost:8080) to run and monitor tasks.

#### Code

```python
from skyvern import Skyvern

skyvern = Skyvern()
task = await skyvern.run_task(prompt="Find the top post on hackernews today")
print(task)
```

For more comprehensive instructions, please see the [Skyvern Documentation](https://docs.skyvern.com).

## How It Works

Skyvern leverages a swarm of intelligent agents, inspired by projects like BabyAGI and AutoGPT, and enhanced with browser automation via [Playwright](https://playwright.dev/). This architecture enables Skyvern to understand and interact with websites, regardless of their specific structure.  Skyvern also has the ability to reason through complex interactions, such as extracting data or making intelligent decisions on form filling, etc.

## Advanced Usage

### Control Your Own Browser (Chrome)

*   Just with Python Code:

```python
from skyvern import Skyvern

browser_path = "/Applications/Google Chrome.app/Contents/MacOS/Google Chrome"
skyvern = Skyvern(
    base_url="http://localhost:8000",
    api_key="YOUR_API_KEY",
    browser_path=browser_path,
)
task = await skyvern.run_task(
    prompt="Find the top post on hackernews today",
)
```

*   With Skyvern Service (via .env file configuration):

```bash
CHROME_EXECUTABLE_PATH="/Applications/Google Chrome.app/Contents/MacOS/Google Chrome"
BROWSER_TYPE=cdp-connect
```

### Run Skyvern with Any Remote Browser

```python
from skyvern import Skyvern

skyvern = Skyvern(cdp_url="your cdp connection url")
task = await skyvern.run_task(
    prompt="Find the top post on hackernews today",
)
```

### Get Consistent Output Schema from Your Run

```python
from skyvern import Skyvern

skyvern = Skyvern()
task = await skyvern.run_task(
    prompt="Find the top post on hackernews today",
    data_extraction_schema={
        "type": "object",
        "properties": {
            "title": {
                "type": "string",
                "description": "The title of the top post"
            },
            "url": {
                "type": "string",
                "description": "The URL of the top post"
            },
            "points": {
                "type": "integer",
                "description": "Number of points the post has received"
            }
        }
    }
)
```

### Helpful Commands to Debug Issues
