[Skyvern](https://github.com/Skyvern-AI/skyvern) is an open-source platform that leverages Large Language Models (LLMs) and computer vision to automate browser-based workflows, making complex web automation tasks easier than ever.  Replace brittle automation solutions with AI-powered interactions.

**Key Features:**

*   üêâ **AI-Powered Automation:** Use LLMs to understand and interact with websites, eliminating the need for custom scripts.
*   üåê **Website Agnostic:**  Works on websites you've never seen before, adapting to layout changes with ease.
*   üîÑ **Workflow Automation:**  Chain multiple tasks together to automate complex processes.
*   üëÅÔ∏è **Computer Vision:**  Utilizes computer vision to identify and interact with visual elements on web pages.
*   üöÄ **SOTA Performance:** Achieves state-of-the-art performance in browser automation tasks (see our [technical report](https://blog.skyvern.com/web-bench-a-new-way-to-compare-ai-browser-agents/)).
*   üîí **Secure & Customizable:**  Supports 2FA, password manager integrations, and offers a flexible, modular design.
*   üíª **Open Source:**  Access all the core logic with the  [AGPL-3.0 License](LICENSE).

**How it Works:**

Skyvern employs a swarm of AI agents, inspired by the task-driven approach of  [BabyAGI](https://github.com/yoheinakajima/babyagi) and  [AutoGPT](https://github.com/Significant-Gravitas/AutoGPT). This allows Skyvern to:

1.  Comprehend a website through computer vision and planning
2.  Execute actions using browser automation libraries like [Playwright](https://playwright.dev/).

Key Advantages:

*   **Adaptability:** Operates on unseen websites without custom code.
*   **Resilience:**  Unaffected by website layout changes.
*   **Scalability:**  Applies workflows across numerous websites.
*   **Intelligence:**  LLMs reason through complex scenarios (e.g., insurance quotes, product comparisons).
