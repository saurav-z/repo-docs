**Skyvern empowers you to automate complex browser workflows with the intelligence of Large Language Models (LLMs) and computer vision, eliminating the need for brittle, website-specific scripts.** ([View on GitHub](https://github.com/Skyvern-AI/skyvern))

## Key Features

*   **AI-Powered Automation:** Leverage LLMs and computer vision to navigate and interact with websites you've never seen before.
*   **Robust to Website Changes:**  Skyvern adapts to website updates without requiring code modifications.
*   **Cross-Website Automation:**  Apply the same workflow across numerous websites with ease.
*   **Advanced Reasoning:**  Handle complex scenarios through LLM-powered reasoning.
*   **Workflows:** Chain multiple tasks together to automate more complex processes.
*   **Data Extraction:**  Extract structured data from websites using schema definitions.
*   **File Downloading & Uploading:**  Download files and upload them to block storage.
*   **2FA Support:** Automate workflows requiring 2FA (QR, Email, SMS).
*   **Integrations:** Integrate with Zapier, Make.com, and N8N.
*   **Livestreaming:** See the browser in real-time.

## Quickstart

### 1. Install Skyvern

```bash
pip install skyvern
```

### 2. Run Skyvern
```bash
skyvern quickstart
```

### 3. Run Task

#### UI (Recommended)

```bash
skyvern run all
```
Go to http://localhost:8080 to run a task

#### Code
```python
from skyvern import Skyvern

skyvern = Skyvern()
task = await skyvern.run_task(prompt="Find the top post on hackernews today")
print(task)
```

Skyvern starts running the task in a browser that pops up and closes it when the task is done. You will be able to view the task from http://localhost:8080/history

## How It Works

Skyvern leverages a swarm of AI agents to understand websites, plan actions, and execute tasks using browser automation. It overcomes the limitations of traditional automation by using Vision LLMs to map visual elements to actions, making it resistant to website changes and adaptable to new sites.
