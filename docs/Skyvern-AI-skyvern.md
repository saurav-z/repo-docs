**Tired of repetitive browser tasks?**  Skyvern uses the power of Large Language Models (LLMs) and computer vision to automate complex browser-based workflows, making web automation easier and more reliable than ever before. Explore the [Skyvern](https://github.com/Skyvern-AI/skyvern) repository to get started.

**Key Features:**

*   üêâ **LLM-Powered Automation:** Automates browser interactions using LLMs, eliminating the need for brittle, hard-coded scripts.
*   üëÅÔ∏è **Computer Vision:**  Understands and interacts with websites based on visual elements, adaptable to layout changes.
*   üåê **Cross-Website Compatibility:**  Applies workflows across numerous websites without custom code for each.
*   ü¶æ **Robust Workflows:** Supports complex scenarios, including form filling, data extraction, file downloads, and more.
*   ‚òÅÔ∏è **Skyvern Cloud:**  A managed cloud version for easy deployment, including anti-bot measures, proxy network, and CAPTCHA solvers.
*   üíª **Flexible Integration:** Supports various LLM providers,  Zapier/Make.com/N8N, and custom integrations.
*   üõ°Ô∏è **Authentication Support:** Includes support for 2FA (TOTP), password managers, and more.
*   üó∫Ô∏è **Advanced Features:**  Including Model Context Protocol (MCP), Docker Compose setup, and more.

**Get Started**

1.  **Install Skyvern:**

    ```bash
    pip install skyvern
    ```

2.  **Run Skyvern:**

    ```bash
    skyvern quickstart
    ```

3.  **Run a Task (UI):**

    ```bash
    skyvern run all
    ```

    Access the UI at [http://localhost:8080](http://localhost:8080) to run a task.

4.  **Run a Task (Code):**
   ```python
    from skyvern import Skyvern

    skyvern = Skyvern()
    task = await skyvern.run_task(prompt="Find the top post on hackernews today")
    print(task)
   ```

    Read about running tasks on different targets [here](#quickstart).

**How Skyvern Works**

Skyvern leverages a swarm of agents inspired by BabyAGI and AutoGPT, empowered by browser automation libraries like Playwright.  This approach offers key advantages:

*   Operates on unseen websites by mapping visual elements to actions.
*   Resistant to website layout changes, unlike traditional methods relying on specific selectors.
*   Applies a single workflow to numerous websites, reasoning through the necessary interactions.
*   Utilizes LLMs to handle complex situations, such as inferring answers to form questions.

**Performance & Evaluation**

Skyvern achieves state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance on the [WebBench benchmark](webbench.ai), with 64.4% accuracy.

*   **WRITE Tasks (RPA):** Skyvern excels at "WRITE" tasks (form filling, downloads, etc.).
