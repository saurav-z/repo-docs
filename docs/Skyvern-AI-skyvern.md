[Skyvern](https://github.com/Skyvern-AI/skyvern) is a powerful AI-driven browser automation tool that lets you automate complex, repetitive tasks across the web using Large Language Models (LLMs) and computer vision. Say goodbye to brittle automation scripts and hello to intelligent, adaptable web interaction.

<p align="center">
  <img src="fern/images/geico_shu_recording_cropped.gif"/>
</p>

## Key Features:

*   ‚úÖ **Intelligent Automation:** Uses LLMs and computer vision to understand and interact with websites, adapting to changes.
*   ‚úÖ **No Custom Code:** Automate workflows without writing website-specific scripts.
*   ‚úÖ **Versatile Workflows:** Chain tasks together with advanced features including navigation, data extraction, loops, file handling, and more.
*   ‚úÖ **Form Filling:**  Automatically fill out web forms with ease.
*   ‚úÖ **Data Extraction:** Extract structured data from websites based on your defined schemas.
*   ‚úÖ **File Handling:** Download files and manage them with automated uploads to block storage.
*   ‚úÖ **2FA Support:**  Supports 2FA methods including QR-based, email and SMS based 2FA
*   ‚úÖ **Livestreaming:**  Watch Skyvern's actions live in your browser for debugging and understanding.
*   ‚úÖ **Integration:**  Integrates with services like Zapier, Make.com, and N8N.
*   ‚úÖ **Cloud & Local Options:** Run Skyvern locally or use the managed cloud version for scalability and convenience.
*   ‚úÖ **Password Manager Integrations:** Integrate with password managers such as Bitwarden
*   ‚úÖ **Model Context Protocol (MCP) Support**: Use any LLM that supports MCP.

## Quickstart

### 1. Install Skyvern

```bash
pip install skyvern
```

### 2. Run Skyvern

```bash
skyvern quickstart
```

### 3. Run task

#### UI (Recommended)

Start the Skyvern service and UI

```bash
skyvern run all
```

Go to http://localhost:8080 and use the UI to run a task

#### Code

```python
from skyvern import Skyvern

skyvern = Skyvern()
task = await skyvern.run_task(prompt="Find the top post on hackernews today")
print(task)
```
Skyvern starts running the task in a browser that pops up and closes it when the task is done. You will be able to view the task from http://localhost:8080/history

You can also run a task on different targets:
```python
from skyvern import Skyvern

# Run on Skyvern Cloud
skyvern = Skyvern(api_key="SKYVERN API KEY")

# Local Skyvern service
skyvern = Skyvern(base_url="http://localhost:8000", api_key="LOCAL SKYVERN API KEY")

task = await skyvern.run_task(prompt="Find the top post on hackernews today")
print(task)
```

## How It Works

Skyvern leverages a swarm of AI agents, inspired by autonomous agent designs like BabyAGI and AutoGPT, to comprehend websites, plan actions, and execute tasks using browser automation. This approach offers several advantages:

*   **Website Agnostic:** Operates on unseen websites without custom code.
*   **Resilient:** Adapts to website layout changes without breaking.
*   **Scalable:** Applies a single workflow across numerous websites.
*   **Intelligent Reasoning:** Uses LLMs to handle complex scenarios, such as inferring information and understanding product variations.

## Performance & Evaluation

Skyvern demonstrates strong performance on benchmarks like WebBench, particularly excelling in tasks involving form filling and data entry.

## Advanced Usage

*   **Control Your Own Browser:** Connect Skyvern to your existing Chrome browser.
*   **Run with Any Remote Browser:** Use a custom CDP connection URL.
*   **Consistent Output Schema:**  Define a data extraction schema to structure results.
*   **Debugging Commands:** Easily manage Skyvern services and UI.

## Docker Compose Setup

*   Follow the steps to install Docker, clone the repository, and configure your `.env` file.
*   Run `docker compose up -d` to launch the Skyvern UI, and other services.

## Skyvern Features

### Skyvern Tasks
Tasks are the fundamental building block inside Skyvern. Each task is a single request to Skyvern, instructing it to navigate through a website and accomplish a specific goal.

Tasks require you to specify a `url`, `prompt`, and can optionally include a `data schema` (if you want the output to conform to a specific schema) and `error codes` (if you want Skyvern to stop running in specific situations).

</p>


### Skyvern Workflows
Workflows are a way to chain multiple tasks together to form a cohesive unit of work.

For example, if you wanted to download all invoices newer than January 1st, you could create a workflow that first navigated to the invoices page, then filtered down to only show invoices newer than January 1st, extracted a list of all eligible invoices, and iterated through each invoice to download it.

Another example is if you wanted to automate purchasing products from an e-commerce store, you could create a workflow that first navigated to the desired product, then added it to a cart. Second, it would navigate to the cart and validate the cart state. Finally, it would go through the checkout process to purchase the items.

Supported workflow features include:
1. Navigation
1. Action
1. Data Extraction
1. Loops
1. File parsing
1. Uploading files to block storage
1. Sending emails
1. Text Prompts
1. Tasks (general)
1. (Coming soon) Conditionals
1. (Coming soon) Custom Code Block

</p>

### Livestreaming
Skyvern allows you to livestream the viewport of the browser to your local machine so that you can see exactly what Skyvern is doing on the web. This is useful for debugging and understanding how Skyvern is interacting with a website, and intervening when necessary

### Form Filling
Skyvern is natively capable of filling out form inputs on websites. Passing in information via the `navigation_goal` will allow Skyvern to comprehend the information and fill out the form accordingly.

### Data Extraction
Skyvern is also capable of extracting data from a website.

You can also specify a `data_extraction_schema` directly within the main prompt to tell Skyvern exactly what data you'd like to extract from the website, in jsonc format. Skyvern's output will be structured in accordance to the supplied schema.

### File Downloading
Skyvern is also capable of downloading files from a website. All downloaded files are automatically uploaded to block storage (if configured), and you can access them via the UI.

### Authentication
Skyvern supports a number of different authentication methods to make it easier to automate tasks behind a login. If you'd like to try it out, please reach out to us [via email](mailto:founders@skyvern.com) or [discord](https://discord.gg/fG2XXEuQX3).
