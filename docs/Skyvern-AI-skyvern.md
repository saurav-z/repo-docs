Tired of tedious manual tasks? **Skyvern empowers you to automate browser-based workflows using the power of Large Language Models (LLMs) and computer vision.**  [Explore the original repo](https://github.com/Skyvern-AI/skyvern).

## Key Features

*   ‚úÖ **Automated Browser Automation:** Automates complex browser-based tasks, replacing brittle, code-dependent solutions.
*   ‚úÖ **LLM-Powered:** Leverages LLMs for intelligent understanding and interaction with websites, navigating even complex scenarios.
*   ‚úÖ **Website-Agnostic:** Operates on websites it's never seen before, adapting to layout changes without custom code.
*   ‚úÖ **Workflow Support:** Chain multiple tasks together.
*   ‚úÖ **Form Filling:** Native form filling capabilities.
*   ‚úÖ **Data Extraction:** Extract structured data directly from websites.
*   ‚úÖ **Real-time Viewport Streaming:**  Livestream the browser's viewport.
*   ‚úÖ **2FA Support:** Integrated support for various 2FA methods.
*   ‚úÖ **Password Manager Integrations:** Bitwarden and more password manager integrations.
*   ‚úÖ **Integration Ready:** Zapier, Make.com, and N8N integrations.

## How Skyvern Works

Skyvern utilizes a task-driven agent design, similar to BabyAGI and AutoGPT, combined with browser automation libraries like Playwright. This system allows for:

*   **Intelligent Website Interaction:** Agents understand and map visual elements to necessary actions, eliminating the need for customized code.
*   **Resistance to Layout Changes:**  Skyvern navigates based on understanding, not static selectors.
*   **Scalable Automation:**  Applies a single workflow across numerous websites.
*   **Reasoning & Inference:**  LLMs handle complex situations.

## Performance & Evaluation

Skyvern achieves state-of-the-art performance, including:

*   **WebBench Benchmark:**  SOTA performance.
*   **WRITE Task Focus:** Excels in RPA-related tasks like form filling and downloads.

## Getting Started

### Skyvern Cloud

[Skyvern Cloud](https://app.skyvern.com) is a managed version of Skyvern.

### Install & Run

**Prerequisites:**
*   Python 3.11+
*   NodeJS & NPM
*   (Windows) Rust, VS Code with C++ dev tools and Windows SDK

```bash
pip install skyvern
skyvern quickstart  # First-time setup, DB migrations etc.
skyvern run all    # Run the UI and service
```

Then navigate to [http://localhost:8080](http://localhost:8080) to create a task using the UI.
Alternatively, use the code example:

```python
from skyvern import Skyvern

skyvern = Skyvern()
task = await skyvern.run_task(prompt="Find the top post on hackernews today")
print(task)
```
## Advanced Usage

*   **Control your own browser (Chrome)**
*   **Run Skyvern with any remote browser**
*   **Get consistent output schema from your run**
*   **Helpful commands to debug issues**

## Docker Compose setup

1.  Make sure you have [Docker Desktop](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop/) installed and running on your machine
2.  Make sure you don't have postgres running locally (Run `docker ps` to check)
3.  Clone the repository and navigate to the root directory
4.  Run `skyvern init llm` to generate a `.env` file. This will be copied into the Docker image.
5.  Fill in the LLM provider key on the [docker-compose.yml](./docker-compose.yml). *If you want to run Skyvern on a remote server, make sure you set the correct server ip for the UI container in [docker-compose.yml](./docker-compose.yml).*
6.  Run the following command via the commandline:
    ```bash
     docker compose up -d
    ```
7.  Navigate to `http://localhost:8080` in your browser to start using the UI

> **Important:** Only one Postgres container can run on port 5432 at a time. If you switch from the CLI-managed Postgres to Docker Compose, you must first remove the original container:
> ```bash
> docker rm -f postgresql-container
> ```

If you encounter any database related errors while using Docker to run Skyvern, check which Postgres container is running with `docker ps`.

## Skyvern Features

### Skyvern Tasks
Tasks are the fundamental building block inside Skyvern. Each task is a single request to Skyvern, instructing it to navigate through a website and accomplish a specific goal.

Tasks require you to specify a `url`, `prompt`, and can optionally include a `data schema` (if you want the output to conform to a specific schema) and `error codes` (if you want Skyvern to stop running in specific situations).
### Skyvern Workflows
Workflows are a way to chain multiple tasks together to form a cohesive unit of work.

For example, if you wanted to download all invoices newer than January 1st, you could create a workflow that first navigated to the invoices page, then filtered down to only show invoices newer than January 1st, extracted a list of all eligible invoices, and iterated through each invoice to download it.

Another example is if you wanted to automate purchasing products from an e-commerce store, you could create a workflow that first navigated to the desired product, then added it to a cart. Second, it would navigate to the cart and validate the cart state. Finally, it would go through the checkout process to purchase the items.

Supported workflow features include:
1. Browser Task
1. Browser Action
1. Data Extraction
1. Validation
1. For Loops
1. File parsing
1. Sending emails
1. Text Prompts
1. HTTP Request Block
1. Custom Code Block
1. Uploading files to block storage
1. (Coming soon) Conditionals

### Livestreaming
Skyvern allows you to livestream the viewport of the browser to your local machine so that you can see exactly what Skyvern is doing on the web. This is useful for debugging and understanding how Skyvern is interacting with a website, and intervening when necessary

### Form Filling
Skyvern is natively capable of filling out form inputs on websites. Passing in information via the `navigation_goal` will allow Skyvern to comprehend the information and fill out the form accordingly.

### Data Extraction
Skyvern is also capable of extracting data from a website.

You can also specify a `data_extraction_schema` directly within the main prompt to tell Skyvern exactly what data you'd like to extract from the website, in jsonc format. Skyvern's output will be structured in accordance to the supplied schema.

### File Downloading
Skyvern is also capable of downloading files from a website. All downloaded files are automatically uploaded to block storage (if configured), and you can access them via the UI.

### Authentication
Skyvern supports a number of different authentication methods to make it easier to automate tasks behind a login. If you'd like to try it out, please reach out to us [via email](mailto:founders@skyvern.com) or [discord](https://discord.gg/fG2XXEuQX3).

### üîê 2FA Support (TOTP)
Skyvern supports a number of different 2FA methods to allow you to automate workflows that require 2FA.

Examples include:
1. QR-based 2FA (e.g. Google Authenticator, Authy)
2. Email based 2FA
3. SMS based 2FA

üîê Learn more about 2FA support [here](https://docs.skyvern.com/credentials/totp).

### Password Manager Integrations
Skyvern currently supports the following password manager integrations:
- [x] Bitwarden
- [ ] 1Password
- [ ] LastPass

## Model Context Protocol (MCP)
Skyvern supports the Model Context Protocol (MCP) to allow you to use any LLM that supports MCP.

See the MCP documentation [here](https://github.com/Skyvern-AI/skyvern/blob/main/integrations/mcp/README.md)

## Zapier / Make.com / N8N Integration
Skyvern supports Zapier, Make.com, and N8N to allow you to connect your Skyvern workflows to other apps.

*   [Zapier](https://docs.skyvern.com/integrations/zapier)
*   [Make.com](https://docs.skyvern.com/integrations/make.com)
*   [N8N](https://docs.skyvern.com/integrations/n8n)
