**Skyvern empowers you to automate complex browser-based tasks using the power of LLMs and computer vision, eliminating the need for brittle, website-specific scripts.**  See the original repo here: [https://github.com/Skyvern-AI/skyvern](https://github.com/Skyvern-AI/skyvern).

## Key Features

*   **AI-Powered Automation:** Leverage LLMs to understand and interact with websites, navigating and completing tasks without the need for custom code for each site.
*   **Resilient to Website Changes:** Built to adapt to website layout changes, ensuring your automation continues to function even as sites evolve.
*   **Cross-Website Compatibility:** Apply a single workflow across numerous websites, streamlining your automation efforts.
*   **Advanced Reasoning:** Benefit from LLMs that understand nuanced interactions, such as inferring answers to questions or recognizing similar products.
*   **Comprehensive Workflow Support:** Build complex automated processes with features including navigation, data extraction, loops, file handling, and more.
*   **Real-Time Monitoring:** Livestream browser viewport during tasks to observe Skyvern's actions.
*   **Form Filling & Data Extraction:** Seamlessly fill forms and extract data from websites with structured output.
*   **Authentication Support:** Automate tasks behind logins using a variety of authentication methods, including 2FA.
*   **Integrations:** Connect to other apps via Zapier, Make.com, and N8N.
*   **Model Context Protocol (MCP) Support**: Use any LLM that supports MCP.
*   **Broad LLM Support:** Compatible with OpenAI, Anthropic, Azure OpenAI, AWS Bedrock, Gemini, Ollama, OpenRouter, and OpenAI-compatible models.

## Quickstart

### Skyvern Cloud

Get started instantly with [Skyvern Cloud](https://app.skyvern.com), a managed service.

### Install & Run Locally

**Prerequisites:**

*   [Python 3.11.x](https://www.python.org/downloads/) (or 3.12)
*   [NodeJS & NPM](https://nodejs.org/en/download/)
*   (Windows only) [Rust](https://rustup.rs/) and VS Code with C++ dev tools and Windows SDK

**Installation:**

```bash
pip install skyvern
```

**Quick Start:**

```bash
skyvern quickstart
```

**Run a Task (UI):**

```bash
skyvern run all
```
Access the UI at http://localhost:8080.

**Run a Task (Code):**

```python
from skyvern import Skyvern

skyvern = Skyvern()
task = await skyvern.run_task(prompt="Find the top post on hackernews today")
print(task)
```

See the full documentation at [https://docs.skyvern.com/](https://docs.skyvern.com/).

## How Skyvern Works

Skyvern leverages a swarm of agents to understand and interact with websites using a design inspired by BabyAGI and AutoGPT. The system diagrams shows the process of Skyvern working with a website. This approach provides:

*   **Adaptability:** Operates on websites it hasn't seen before, mapping visual elements to required actions.
*   **Resilience:** Resistant to website layout changes.
*   **Scalability:** Enables workflows to work on numerous websites.
*   **Intelligent Interactions:** Leverages LLMs to manage sophisticated interactions, such as dealing with inferred knowledge.

## Performance & Evaluation

Skyvern demonstrates leading performance, including:

*   **SOTA Performance** on the [WebBench benchmark](webbench.ai) with 64.4% accuracy.
*   **Top Performer** on WRITE tasks (RPA-related tasks).

See evaluation results and a technical report here: [https://blog.skyvern.com/web-bench-a-new-way-to-compare-ai-browser-agents/](https://blog.skyvern.com/web-bench-a-new-way-to-compare-ai-browser-agents/)

## Advanced Usage

### Control Your Own Browser (Chrome)

```python
from skyvern import Skyvern

browser_path = "/Applications/Google Chrome.app/Contents/MacOS/Google Chrome"
skyvern = Skyvern(
    base_url="http://localhost:8000",
    api_key="YOUR_API_KEY",
    browser_path=browser_path,
)
task = await skyvern.run_task(
    prompt="Find the top post on hackernews today",
)
```

### Run Skyvern with any remote browser

```python
from skyvern import Skyvern

skyvern = Skyvern(cdp_url="your cdp connection url")
task = await skyvern.run_task(
    prompt="Find the top post on hackernews today",
)
```

### Consistent Output Schema

```python
from skyvern import Skyvern

skyvern = Skyvern()
task = await skyvern.run_task(
    prompt="Find the top post on hackernews today",
    data_extraction_schema={
        "type": "object",
        "properties": {
            "title": {
                "type": "string",
                "description": "The title of the top post"
            },
            "url": {
                "type": "string",
                "description": "The URL of the top post"
            },
            "points": {
                "type": "integer",
                "description": "Number of points the post has received"
            }
        }
    }
)
```
