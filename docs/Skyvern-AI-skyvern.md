Skyvern is a powerful, open-source tool that uses Large Language Models (LLMs) and computer vision to automate complex browser-based tasks, eliminating the need for brittle and website-specific scripts. [Explore Skyvern on GitHub](https://github.com/Skyvern-AI/skyvern).

**Key Features:**

*   **AI-Powered Automation:**  Intelligently navigates and interacts with websites using LLMs, adapting to website changes.
*   **Workflow Creation:** Build complex, multi-step automation workflows.
*   **Data Extraction & Form Filling:** Extract structured data and automate form submissions.
*   **Livestreaming & Debugging:**  Visually track and debug workflows in real-time.
*   **Advanced Integrations:** Supports 2FA (including TOTP, QR, Email & SMS), Password Managers (Bitwarden), and Integrations (Zapier, Make.com, N8N).
*   **Open Source:**  Benefit from the community, customize to your needs, and have full control over your automations.
*   **SOTA Performance:** Achieves state-of-the-art performance on WebBench benchmark and is the best performing agent on WRITE tasks.

### Quickstart

**Installation:**

```bash
pip install skyvern
```

**Run:**

```bash
skyvern quickstart
```
Then start UI
```bash
skyvern run all
```

Go to http://localhost:8080 and use the UI to run a task.

**Code Example:**

```python
from skyvern import Skyvern

skyvern = Skyvern()
task = await skyvern.run_task(prompt="Find the top post on hackernews today")
print(task)
```

### Skyvern Cloud

For a fully managed solution, try [Skyvern Cloud](https://app.skyvern.com). It offers parallel instance execution, anti-bot mechanisms, and CAPTCHA solvers.

## How Skyvern Works

Skyvern uses a swarm of agents and browser automation (Playwright) to comprehend a website, plan, and execute actions.

</picture>

This approach offers:

1.  **Website Agnosticism:** Operates on unseen websites by mapping visual elements to actions.
2.  **Resilience to Layout Changes:**  Adaptable to website updates due to its reliance on LLMs for interaction, rather than hard-coded selectors.
3.  **Scalability:** Apply a single workflow across many websites, as the system can reason through interactions.
4.  **Advanced Reasoning:** Leverages LLMs to handle complex scenarios, such as inferring answers to form questions or understanding product equivalency across different websites.

## Performance & Evaluation

Skyvern excels in browser automation tasks and delivers impressive results:

*   **WebBench Benchmark:** Skyvern has SOTA performance on the [WebBench benchmark](webbench.ai) with a 64.4% accuracy.
*   **WRITE Task Performance:**  Leading performance in tasks that involve form filling, logins, and file downloads.

## Advanced Usage

### Control Your Own Browser (Chrome)

```python
from skyvern import Skyvern

# The path to your Chrome browser. This example path is for Mac.
browser_path = "/Applications/Google Chrome.app/Contents/MacOS/Google Chrome"
skyvern = Skyvern(
    base_url="http://localhost:8000",
    api_key="YOUR_API_KEY",
    browser_path=browser_path,
)
task = await skyvern.run_task(
    prompt="Find the top post on hackernews today",
)
```

### Run with any remote browser

```python
from skyvern import Skyvern

skyvern = Skyvern(cdp_url="your cdp connection url")
task = await skyvern.run_task(
    prompt="Find the top post on hackernews today",
)
```

### Consistent Output Schema

```python
from skyvern import Skyvern

skyvern = Skyvern()
task = await skyvern.run_task(
    prompt="Find the top post on hackernews today",
    data_extraction_schema={
        "type": "object",
        "properties": {
            "title": {
                "type": "string",
                "description": "The title of the top post"
            },
            "url": {
                "type": "string",
                "description": "The URL of the top post"
            },
            "points": {
                "type": "integer",
                "description": "Number of points the post has received"
            }
        }
    }
)
```

### Helpful Commands to Debug

```bash
# Launch the Skyvern Server Separately*
skyvern run server

# Launch the Skyvern UI
skyvern run ui

# Check status of the Skyvern service
skyvern status

# Stop the Skyvern service
skyvern stop all

# Stop the Skyvern UI
skyvern stop ui

# Stop the Skyvern Server Separately

## Docker Compose Setup

Follow these steps to set up Skyvern using Docker Compose.

1.  Install and run [Docker Desktop](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop/).
2.  Ensure no local Postgres instance is running (check with `docker ps`).
3.  Clone the repository and navigate to the root directory.
4.  Run `skyvern init llm` to generate a `.env` file.
5.  Fill in your LLM provider key in `docker-compose.yml`.  **Important:** set the UI container's server IP if running on a remote server.
6.  Run: `docker compose up -d`.
7.  Access the UI at `http://localhost:8080`.

```bash
docker rm -f postgresql-container
```
