## Quickstart

### Installation

```bash
pip install skyvern
```

### Running Skyvern

*   **UI (Recommended):**

    1.  Start the Skyvern service and UI:

    ```bash
    skyvern run all
    ```

    2.  Access the UI in your browser: [http://localhost:8080](http://localhost:8080) and run a task.

*   **Code:**

    ```python
    from skyvern import Skyvern

    skyvern = Skyvern()
    task = await skyvern.run_task(prompt="Find the top post on hackernews today")
    print(task)
    ```

    Run a task in a browser and view task history at [http://localhost:8080/history](http://localhost:8080/history)

### Advanced Usage

*   **Control your own browser (Chrome):**
    ```python
    from skyvern import Skyvern
    browser_path = "/Applications/Google Chrome.app/Contents/MacOS/Google Chrome" # Example Path
    skyvern = Skyvern(browser_path=browser_path)
    task = await skyvern.run_task(prompt="Find the top post on hackernews today")
    ```
*   **Run Skyvern with any remote browser:**
    ```python
    from skyvern import Skyvern
    skyvern = Skyvern(cdp_url="your cdp connection url")
    task = await skyvern.run_task(prompt="Find the top post on hackernews today")
    ```
*   **Get consistent output schema:**
    ```python
    from skyvern import Skyvern
    task = await skyvern.run_task(
        prompt="Find the top post on hackernews today",
        data_extraction_schema={
            "type": "object",
            "properties": {
                "title": {"type": "string", "description": "The title of the top post"},
                "url": {"type": "string", "description": "The URL of the top post"},
                "points": {"type": "integer", "description": "Number of points the post has received"}
            }
        }
    )
    ```

*   **Helpful Commands**
```bash
skyvern run server  # Launch Skyvern Server Separately
skyvern run ui    # Launch Skyvern UI
skyvern status    # Check status of the Skyvern service
