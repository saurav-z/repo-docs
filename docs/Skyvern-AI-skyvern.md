## Getting Started

### Quickstart

1.  **Install Skyvern:**

    ```bash
    pip install skyvern
    ```

2.  **Run Skyvern (for initial setup):**

    ```bash
    skyvern quickstart
    ```

3.  **Run a Task:**

    *   **UI (Recommended):**

        ```bash
        skyvern run all
        ```

        Then, go to `http://localhost:8080` to run a task using the UI.
    *   **Code:**

        ```python
        from skyvern import Skyvern

        skyvern = Skyvern()
        task = await skyvern.run_task(prompt="Find the top post on hackernews today")
        print(task)
        ```

        View task history at `http://localhost:8080/history`.  You can also specify `base_url` or `api_key` to use a local or cloud service.

### Dependencies

*   [Python 3.11.x](https://www.python.org/downloads/) (works with 3.12, not yet ready for 3.13)
*   [NodeJS & NPM](https://nodejs.org/en/download/)
*   For Windows: [Rust](https://rustup.rs/), VS Code with C++ dev tools and Windows SDK

## How Skyvern Works

Skyvern is built on the principles of task-driven autonomous agents, inspired by projects like BabyAGI and AutoGPT. It leverages browser automation with libraries like Playwright. Key advantages include:

*   Operates on unseen websites without custom code.
*   Resists website layout changes.
*   Applies workflows across various websites.
*   Uses LLMs for intelligent interaction and complex scenario handling.

For details, see our technical report: [here](https://blog.skyvern.com/skyvern-2-0-state-of-the-art-web-navigation-with-85-8-on-webvoyager-eval/).

## Performance & Evaluation

Skyvern achieves SOTA performance on the [WebBench benchmark](webbench.ai), with 64.4% accuracy.

*   **WRITE Task Performance:** Skyvern excels in WRITE tasks, such as form filling, login, and file downloads.

---

## Advanced Usage

*   **Control Your Browser:**  Specify the path to your Chrome executable (see examples in the original README).  Requires setting `CHROME_EXECUTABLE_PATH` and `BROWSER_TYPE=cdp-connect` in your `.env` file.
*   **Run with a Remote Browser:** Use a CDP connection URL.
*   **Consistent Output Schema:**  Define a `data_extraction_schema` in your prompt to structure the output.
*   **Debugging commands**:  `skyvern run server`, `skyvern run ui`, `skyvern status`, `skyvern stop all`, `skyvern stop ui`, `skyvern stop server`

---

## Docker Compose Setup

1.  Install and run [Docker Desktop](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop/).
2.  Clone the repository.
3.  Run `skyvern init llm` to create a `.env` file.
4.  Fill in your LLM provider key in `docker-compose.yml`.  (Important:  Configure correct server IP for the UI container if running on a remote server.)
5.  Run:

    ```bash
    docker compose up -d
    ```

6.  Access the UI at `http://localhost:8080`.
7.  **Important:** Remove the original Postgres container if you switch from CLI-managed Postgres to Docker Compose.
