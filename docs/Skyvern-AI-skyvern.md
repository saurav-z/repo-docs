**Skyvern revolutionizes browser automation by using Large Language Models (LLMs) and computer vision to automate complex, browser-based workflows, eliminating the need for brittle, website-specific code.** ([Back to original repo](https://github.com/Skyvern-AI/skyvern))

## Key Features

*   **Intelligent Automation:** Leverage LLMs to understand, plan, and execute actions on any website, adapting to layout changes.
*   **Workflow Automation:** Chain multiple tasks together to automate end-to-end processes, from data extraction to form filling and file downloading.
*   **Real-time Livestreaming:** Monitor Skyvern's actions with real-time browser viewport streaming for debugging and control.
*   **Versatile Integrations:** Seamlessly integrate with authentication methods, password managers, and popular platforms like Zapier, Make.com, and N8N.
*   **Multi-LLM Support:** Compatible with a variety of LLMs, including OpenAI, Anthropic, Azure OpenAI, AWS Bedrock, Gemini, Ollama, and OpenRouter.
*   **Cloud and Local Deployment:** Easily deploy Skyvern using our managed cloud service or run it locally with Docker Compose.

## Getting Started

### Quickstart

1.  **Install:**

    ```bash
    pip install skyvern
    ```

2.  **Run (for first-time setup):**

    ```bash
    skyvern quickstart
    ```

3.  **Run UI (Recommended):** Start the Skyvern service and UI (when DB is up and running)

    ```bash
    skyvern run all
    ```

    Go to http://localhost:8080 and use the UI to run a task.

4.  **Run Task (Code):**

    ```python
    from skyvern import Skyvern

    skyvern = Skyvern()
    task = await skyvern.run_task(prompt="Find the top post on hackernews today")
    print(task)
    ```

    You can also run a task on different targets:

    ```python
    from skyvern import Skyvern

    # Run on Skyvern Cloud
    skyvern = Skyvern(api_key="SKYVERN API KEY")

    # Local Skyvern service
    skyvern = Skyvern(base_url="http://localhost:8000", api_key="LOCAL SKYVERN API KEY")

    task = await skyvern.run_task(prompt="Find the top post on hackernews today")
    print(task)
    ```

| Ollama | Run any locally hosted model via [Ollama](https://github.com/ollama/ollama) |
| OpenRouter | Access models through [OpenRouter](https://openrouter.ai) |
| OpenAI-compatible | Any custom API endpoint that follows OpenAI's API format (via [liteLLM](https://docs.litellm.ai/docs/providers/openai_compatible)) |

For more info on the environment variables used by each LLM, take a look at the original README for the project.

## Feature Roadmap

*   **Open Source:** Open Source Skyvern's core codebase
*   **Workflow Support:** Allow support to chain multiple Skyvern calls together
*   **Improved context:** Improve Skyvern's ability to understand content around interactable elements by introducing feeding relevant label context through the text prompt
*   **Cost Savings:** Improve Skyvern's stability and reduce the cost of running Skyvern by optimizing the context tree passed into Skyvern
*   **Self-serve UI:** Deprecate the Streamlit UI in favour of a React-based UI component that allows users to kick off new jobs in Skyvern
*   **Workflow UI Builder:** Introduce a UI to allow users to build and analyze workflows visually
*   **Chrome Viewport streaming:** Introduce a way to live-stream the Chrome viewport to the user's browser (as a part of the self-serve UI)
*   **Past Runs UI:** Deprecate the Streamlit UI in favour of a React-based UI that allows you to visualize past runs and their results
*   **Auto workflow builder ("Observer") mode:** Allow Skyvern to auto-generate workflows as it's navigating the web to make it easier to build new workflows
*   **Prompt Caching:** Introduce a caching layer to the LLM calls to dramatically reduce the cost of running Skyvern (memorize past actions and repeat them!)
*   **Web Evaluation Dataset:** Integrate Skyvern with public benchmark tests to track the quality of our models over time
*   **Improved Debug mode:** Allow Skyvern to plan its actions and get "approval" before running them, allowing you to debug what it's doing and more easily iterate on the prompt
*   **Chrome Extension:** Allow users to interact with Skyvern through a Chrome extension (incl voice mode, saving tasks, etc.)
*   **Skyvern Action Recorder:** Allow Skyvern to watch a user complete a task and then automatically generate a workflow for it
*   **Interactable Livestream:** Allow users to interact with the livestream in real-time to intervene when necessary (such as manually submitting sensitive forms)
*   **Integrate LLM Observability tools:** Integrate LLM Observability tools to allow back-testing prompt changes with specific data sets + visualize the performance of Skyvern over time
*   **Langchain Integration:** Create langchain integration in langchain_community to use Skyvern as a "tool".
