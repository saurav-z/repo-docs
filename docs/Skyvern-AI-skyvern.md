**Skyvern empowers you to automate browser-based tasks using the power of Large Language Models (LLMs) and Computer Vision, streamlining your web automation processes.**  Tired of brittle web automation solutions? Skyvern offers a robust API to automate complex manual workflows across countless websites.  [Explore the code on GitHub](https://github.com/Skyvern-AI/skyvern).

## Key Features

*   **LLM-Powered Automation:** Leverages LLMs to understand and interact with websites, going beyond simple DOM parsing.
*   **Resilient to Website Changes:** Adapts to website layout changes, eliminating the need for constant script updates.
*   **Cross-Website Compatibility:**  Apply the same workflow to numerous websites with minimal adjustments.
*   **Intelligent Reasoning:**  LLMs enable complex actions like inferring information and handling variations in data.
*   **Workflow Builder:** Chain multiple tasks together to automate complex processes
*   **Real-time Monitoring:** Livestream your browser's viewport.
*   **Comprehensive Features:** Includes Form Filling, Data Extraction, and File Downloading.

## Quickstart

### 1. Install Skyvern

```bash
pip install skyvern
```

### 2. Run Skyvern
*   **Via UI (Recommended):** Start the service and UI with `skyvern run all` and access it at http://localhost:8080.

### 3. Run a Task

*   **Code Example:**
    ```python
    from skyvern import Skyvern

    skyvern = Skyvern()
    task = await skyvern.run_task(prompt="Find the top post on hackernews today")
    print(task)
    ```

## Skyvern Cloud

Experience Skyvern without infrastructure management using [Skyvern Cloud](https://app.skyvern.com).  It includes parallel instance execution, anti-bot defenses, and CAPTCHA solvers.

## How Skyvern Works

Skyvern, inspired by the task-driven design of BabyAGI and AutoGPT, leverages a swarm of agents interacting with websites via the [Playwright](https://playwright.dev/) browser automation library.

[See system diagram]

This allows Skyvern to:

1.  Operate on unseen websites through visual element mapping.
2.  Withstand website layout changes.
3.  Apply a single workflow to various sites.
4.  Use LLMs for nuanced interactions.  *Examples include* deriving information and handling variations in data.

## Performance & Evaluation

Skyvern leads in the [WebBench benchmark](webbench.ai) with 64.4% accuracy.

[See WebBench results]
## Advanced Usage

### Control your own browser (Chrome)

```python
from skyvern import Skyvern

browser_path = "/Applications/Google Chrome.app/Contents/MacOS/Google Chrome"
skyvern = Skyvern(
    base_url="http://localhost:8000",
    api_key="YOUR_API_KEY",
    browser_path=browser_path,
)
task = await skyvern.run_task(
    prompt="Find the top post on hackernews today",
)
```

### Run Skyvern with any remote browser

```python
from skyvern import Skyvern

skyvern = Skyvern(cdp_url="your cdp connection url")
task = await skyvern.run_task(
    prompt="Find the top post on hackernews today",
)
```

### Get consistent output schema from your run

```python
from skyvern import Skyvern

skyvern = Skyvern()
task = await skyvern.run_task(
    prompt="Find the top post on hackernews today",
    data_extraction_schema={
        "type": "object",
        "properties": {
            "title": {
                "type": "string",
                "description": "The title of the top post"
            },
            "url": {
                "type": "string",
                "description": "The URL of the top post"
            },
            "points": {
                "type": "integer",
                "description": "Number of points the post has received"
            }
        }
    }
)
```

### Helpful commands to debug issues

```bash
# Launch the Skyvern Server Separately*
skyvern run server

# Launch the Skyvern UI
skyvern run ui

# Check status of the Skyvern service
skyvern status

# Stop the Skyvern service
skyvern stop all

# Stop the Skyvern UI
skyvern stop ui

# Stop the Skyvern Server Separately
skyvern stop server
```

## Docker Compose setup

1. Make sure you have [Docker Desktop](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop/) installed and running on your machine
1. Make sure you don't have postgres running locally (Run `docker ps` to check)
1. Clone the repository and navigate to the root directory
1. Run `skyvern init llm` to generate a `.env` file. This will be copied into the Docker image.
1. Fill in the LLM provider key on the [docker-compose.yml](./docker-compose.yml). *If you want to run Skyvern on a remote server, make sure you set the correct server ip for the UI container in [docker-compose.yml](./docker-compose.yml).*
2. Run the following command via the commandline:
   ```bash
    docker compose up -d
   ```
3. Navigate to `http://localhost:8080` in your browser to start using the UI

> **Important:** Only one Postgres container can run on port 5432 at a time. If you switch from the CLI-managed Postgres to Docker Compose, you must first remove the original container:
> ```bash
> docker rm -f postgresql-container
> ```

If you encounter any database related errors while using Docker to run Skyvern, check which Postgres container is running with `docker ps`.
