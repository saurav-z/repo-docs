## Hardware Requirements

The hardware requirements vary depending on the model and training settings. See each model's section for details.

### General Notes
*   **NVIDIA:** Generally, anything from a 3080 and up should work well.
*   **AMD:** Supports LoRA and full-rank tuning (tested on 7900 XTX 24GB and MI300X). May use more memory due to the lack of `xformers`.
*   **Apple:** Tested on M3 Max with 128GB memory. Requires 24GB+ due to lack of memory-efficient attention.
*   See each model's section for more detailed requirements.

## Toolkit

For more information about the associated toolkit distributed with SimpleTuner, refer to [the toolkit documentation](/toolkit/README.md).

## Setup

Detailed setup instructions are available in the [installation documentation](/INSTALL.md).

## Troubleshooting

Enable debug logs for more details by adding `export SIMPLETUNER_LOG_LEVEL=DEBUG` to your environment (`config/config.env`).
For performance analysis, set `SIMPLETUNER_TRAINING_LOOP_LOG_LEVEL=DEBUG`.
Consult [OPTIONS.md](/OPTIONS.md) for a comprehensive list of available options.
