## Model Support

SimpleTuner supports a variety of cutting-edge models. Here's a quick overview:

*   **HiDream:** Memory-efficient training for NVIDIA GPUs with custom ControlNet implementation, optional MoEGate loss augmentation, and more.  See [hardware requirements](#hidream) or the [quickstart guide](/documentation/quickstart/HIDREAM.md).
*   **Flux.1:** Faster training with new `--fuse_qkv_projections` option, ControlNet support, and Instruct fine-tuning. See [hardware requirements](#flux1-dev-schnell) or the [quickstart guide](/documentation/quickstart/FLUX.md).
*   **Wan Video:** Preliminary text-to-video training integration. See the [Wan Video Quickstart](/documentation/quickstart/WAN.md) guide to start training.
*   **LTX Video:** Efficient training with LyCORIS and full tuning. See the [LTX Video Quickstart](/documentation/quickstart/LTXVIDEO.md) guide to start training.
*   **PixArt Sigma:** Extensive training integration with both 600M & 900M models, including ControlNet support. See the [PixArt Quickstart](/documentation/quickstart/SIGMA.md) guide.
*   **NVLabs Sana:** Lightweight and fast model training. See the [NVLabs Sana Quickstart](/documentation/quickstart/SANA.md) guide.
*   **Stable Diffusion 3:** Supports LoRA, full finetuning and ControlNet training. See the [Stable Diffusion 3 Quickstart](/documentation/quickstart/SD3.md).
*   **Kwai Kolors:** An SDXL-based model with ChatGLM (General Language Model) 6B as its text encoder, almost as deep as SDXL support.
*   **Lumina2:** LoRA, Lycoris, and full finetuning support. A [Lumina2 Quickstart](/documentation/quickstart/LUMINA2.md) is available.
*   **Cosmos2 Predict (Image):** Text-to-image support with Lycoris or full-rank tuning. A [Cosmos2 Predict Quickstart](/documentation/quickstart/COSMOS2IMAGE.md) is available.
*   **Legacy Stable Diffusion Models:** Supports training with SD 1.5 and SD 2.x.

## Hardware Requirements

SimpleTuner is designed to be flexible and efficient.  See the original README for specific hardware recommendations.

## Toolkit

For information about the SimpleTuner toolkit, refer to [the toolkit documentation](/toolkit/README.md).

## Setup

Detailed setup instructions are available in the [installation documentation](/INSTALL.md).

## Troubleshooting

Enable debug logs by adding `export SIMPLETUNER_LOG_LEVEL=DEBUG` to your environment.
For performance analysis, use `SIMPLETUNER_TRAINING_LOOP_LOG_LEVEL=DEBUG`.
Consult [this documentation](/OPTIONS.md) for a comprehensive list of options.
