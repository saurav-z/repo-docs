## Hardware Requirements

### General Requirements

*   **NVIDIA:** RTX 3080+ recommended (tested up to H200)
*   **AMD:** 7900 XTX 24GB and MI300X verified (higher memory usage vs NVIDIA)
*   **Apple:** M3 Max+ with 24GB+ unified memory for LoRA training

### Memory Guidelines by Model Size

*   **Large models (12B+)**: A100-80G for full-rank, 24G+ for LoRA/Lycoris
*   **Medium models (2B-8B)**: 16G+ for LoRA, 40G+ for full-rank training
*   **Small models (<2B)**: 12G+ sufficient for most training types

**Note:** Quantization (int8/fp8/nf4) significantly reduces memory requirements. Refer to individual [quickstart guides](#quickstart-guides) for model-specific requirements.
