*   **[April 2025]** [Seed-Thinking-v1.5](https://github.com/ByteDance-Seed/Seed-Thinking-v1.5/blob/main/seed-thinking-v1.5.pdf) tech report is released! Trained with verl, Seed-Thinking-v1.5 achieves 86.7 on AIME 2024, 55.0 on Codeforces and 77.3 on GPQA, demonstrating excellent reasoning abilities in STEM and coding. Beyond reasoning tasks, the method demonstrates notable generalization across diverse domains.
*   **[March 2025]** [DAPO](https://dapo-sia.github.io/) is the open-sourced SOTA RL algorithm that achieves 50 points on AIME 2024 based on the Qwen2.5-32B pre-trained model, surpassing the previous SOTA achieved by DeepSeek's GRPO (DeepSeek-R1-Zero-Qwen-32B). DAPO's training is fully powered by verl and the reproduction code is available in `recipe/dapo` now.
