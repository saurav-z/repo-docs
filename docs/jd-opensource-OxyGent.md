## Quick Start

1.  **Set up your environment:**

    ```bash
    # Using conda
    conda create -n oxy_env python==3.10
    conda activate oxy_env
    pip install oxygent
    ```
    
    ```bash
    # Using uv
    curl -LsSf https://astral.sh/uv/install.sh | sh
    uv python install 3.10 
    uv venv .venv --python 3.10
    source .venv/bin/activate
    uv pip install oxygent
    ```

2.  **Write and run a sample Python script:**

    ```python
    import os
    from oxygent import MAS, Config, oxy, preset_tools

    Config.set_agent_llm_model("default_llm")

    oxy_space = [
       oxy.HttpLLM(
          name="default_llm",
          api_key=os.getenv("DEFAULT_LLM_API_KEY"),
          base_url=os.getenv("DEFAULT_LLM_BASE_URL"),
          model_name=os.getenv("DEFAULT_LLM_MODEL_NAME"),
          llm_params={"temperature": 0.01},
          semaphore=4,
       ),
       preset_tools.time_tools,
       oxy.ReActAgent(
          name="time_agent",
          desc="A tool that can query the time",
          tools=["time_tools"],
       ),
       preset_tools.file_tools,
       oxy.ReActAgent(
          name="file_agent",
          desc="A tool that can operate the file system",
          tools=["file_tools"],
       ),
       preset_tools.math_tools,
       oxy.ReActAgent(
          name="math_agent",
          desc="A tool that can perform mathematical calculations.",
          tools=["math_tools"],
       ),
       oxy.ReActAgent(
          is_master=True,
          name="master_agent",
          sub_agents=["time_agent", "file_agent", "math_agent"],
       ),
    ]

    async def main():
       async with MAS(oxy_space=oxy_space) as mas:
          await mas.start_web_service(first_query="What time is it now? Please save it into time.txt.")

    if __name__ == "__main__":
       import asyncio
       asyncio.run(main())
    ```

3.  **Configure your LLM settings using environment variables or a `.env` file:**

    ```bash
    export DEFAULT_LLM_API_KEY="your_api_key"
    export DEFAULT_LLM_BASE_URL="your_base_url"  # if you want to use a custom base URL
    export DEFAULT_LLM_MODEL_NAME="your_model_name"
    ```

    ```bash
    # create a .env file
    DEFAULT_LLM_API_KEY="your_api_key"
    DEFAULT_LLM_BASE_URL="your_base_url"
    DEFAULT_LLM_MODEL_NAME="your_model_name"
    ```

4.  **Run the example script:**

    ```bash
    python demo.py
    ```

5.  **View the output.**
