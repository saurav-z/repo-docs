<h1 align="center">OxyGent: Build Production-Ready Intelligent Systems with Ease</h1>

OxyGent is a powerful, open-source Python framework designed to simplify the development of intelligent systems by unifying tools, models, and agents into modular components.  [Explore the OxyGent Repository](https://github.com/jd-opensource/OxyGent)

## Key Features

*   üöÄ **Efficient Multi-Agent Development**: Build, deploy, and evolve AI teams rapidly using modular, reusable Oxy components.
*   ü§ù **Intelligent Collaboration**:  Enable dynamic planning with agents that decompose tasks, negotiate solutions, and adapt in real-time.
*   üï∏Ô∏è **Elastic Architecture**: Support any agent topology, from simple ReAct to complex hybrid patterns.
*   üîÅ **Continuous Improvement**: Leverage built-in evaluation engines for auto-generated training data and continuous agent improvement.
*   üìà **Scalability**:  Benefit from a distributed scheduler for linear cost growth and exponential gains in collaborative intelligence.

## Project Overview

**OxyGent** is an open-source framework that unifies tools, models, and agents into modular Oxy. Empowering developers with transparent, end-to-end pipelines, OxyGent makes building, running, and evolving multi-agent systems seamless and infinitely extensible.

## Performance

The latest version of OxyGent (July 15, 2025) in the [GAIA](https://huggingface.co/spaces/gaia-benchmark/leaderboard) get 59.14 points, and current top opensource system OWL gets 60.8 points.

## Quick Start

Follow these steps to get started with OxyGent:

### Step 1: Create and activate a Python environment

*   **Method 1: Conda**

    ```bash
    conda create -n oxy_env python==3.10
    conda activate oxy_env
    ```

*   **Method 2: uv**

    ```bash
    curl -LsSf https://astral.sh/uv/install.sh | sh
    uv python install 3.10 
    uv venv .venv --python 3.10
    source .venv/bin/activate
    ```

### Step 2: Install the required Python package

*   **Method 1: Conda**

    ```bash
    pip install oxygent
    ```

*   **Method 2: uv**

    ```bash
    uv pip install oxygent
    ```

*   **Method 3: Development Environment**

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/jd-opensource/OxyGent.git
    cd OxyGent
    pip install -r requirements.txt # or in uv
    brew install coreutils # maybe essential
    ```

### Step 3: Node.js Environment (if using MCP)

*   Download and install **[Node.js](https://nodejs.org)**

### Step 4: Write a sample Python script (`demo.py`)

```python
import os
from oxygent import MAS, Config, oxy, preset_tools

Config.set_agent_llm_model("default_llm")

oxy_space = [
    oxy.HttpLLM(
        name="default_llm",
        api_key=os.getenv("DEFAULT_LLM_API_KEY"),
        base_url=os.getenv("DEFAULT_LLM_BASE_URL"),
        model_name=os.getenv("DEFAULT_LLM_MODEL_NAME"),
    ),
    preset_tools.time_tools,
    oxy.ReActAgent(
        name="time_agent",
        desc="A tool that can query the time",
        tools=["time_tools"],
    ),
    preset_tools.file_tools,
    oxy.ReActAgent(
        name="file_agent",
        desc="A tool that can operate the file system",
        tools=["file_tools"],
    ),
    preset_tools.math_tools,
    oxy.ReActAgent(
        name="math_agent",
        desc="A tool that can perform mathematical calculations.",
        tools=["math_tools"],
    ),
    oxy.ReActAgent(
        is_master=True,
        name="master_agent",
        sub_agents=["time_agent", "file_agent", "math_agent"],
    ),
]

async def main():
    async with MAS(oxy_space=oxy_space) as mas:
        await mas.start_web_service(
            first_query="What time is it now? Please save it into time.txt."
        )

if __name__ == "__main__":
    import asyncio
    asyncio.run(main())
```

### Step 5: Set Environment Variables

*   **Method 1: Terminal**

    ```bash
    export DEFAULT_LLM_API_KEY="your_api_key"
    export DEFAULT_LLM_BASE_URL="your_base_url"
    export DEFAULT_LLM_MODEL_NAME="your_model_name"
    ```

*   **Method 2: .env file**

    Create a `.env` file in the project directory with the following content:

    ```
    DEFAULT_LLM_API_KEY="your_api_key"
    DEFAULT_LLM_BASE_URL="your_base_url"
    DEFAULT_LLM_MODEL_NAME="your_model_name"
    ```

### Step 6: Run the Example

```bash
python demo.py
```

### Step 7: View the Output
