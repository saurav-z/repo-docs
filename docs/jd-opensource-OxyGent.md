## Quick Start Guide

Get started with OxyGent in a few simple steps:

### Step 1: Set Up Your Python Environment

Choose your preferred method for managing the Python environment:

*   **Method 1: Conda**

    ```bash
    conda create -n oxy_env python==3.10
    conda activate oxy_env
    ```
*   **Method 2: uv**

    ```bash
    curl -LsSf https://astral.sh/uv/install.sh | sh
    uv python install 3.10
    uv venv .venv --python 3.10
    source .venv/bin/activate
    ```

### Step 2: Install OxyGent

*   **Method 1: pip**

    ```bash
    pip install oxygent
    ```
*   **Method 2: uv**

    ```bash
    uv pip install oxygent
    ```
*   **Method 3: Development Mode**

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/jd-opensource/OxyGent.git
    cd OxyGent
    pip install -r requirements.txt  # or using uv
    brew install coreutils # essential
    ```

### Step 3: Node.js (if using MCP)

*   Download and install **[Node.js](https://nodejs.org)**.

### Step 4: Sample Python Script (demo.py)

Create a demo Python script to get started:

```python
import os
from oxygent import MAS, Config, oxy, preset_tools

Config.set_agent_llm_model("default_llm")

oxy_space = [
    oxy.HttpLLM(
        name="default_llm",
        api_key=os.getenv("DEFAULT_LLM_API_KEY"),
        base_url=os.getenv("DEFAULT_LLM_BASE_URL"),
        model_name=os.getenv("DEFAULT_LLM_MODEL_NAME"),
    ),
    preset_tools.time_tools,
    oxy.ReActAgent(
        name="time_agent",
        desc="A tool that can query the time",
        tools=["time_tools"],
    ),
    preset_tools.file_tools,
    oxy.ReActAgent(
        name="file_agent",
        desc="A tool that can operate the file system",
        tools=["file_tools"],
    ),
    preset_tools.math_tools,
    oxy.ReActAgent(
        name="math_agent",
        desc="A tool that can perform mathematical calculations.",
        tools=["math_tools"],
    ),
    oxy.ReActAgent(
        is_master=True,
        name="master_agent",
        sub_agents=["time_agent", "file_agent", "math_agent"],
    ),
]

async def main():
    async with MAS(oxy_space=oxy_space) as mas:
        await mas.start_web_service(
            first_query="What time is it now? Please save it into time.txt."
        )

if __name__ == "__main__":
    import asyncio
    asyncio.run(main())
```

### Step 5: Configure Environment Variables

*   **Method 1: Terminal**

    ```bash
    export DEFAULT_LLM_API_KEY="your_api_key"
    export DEFAULT_LLM_BASE_URL="your_base_url"
    export DEFAULT_LLM_MODEL_NAME="your_model_name"
    ```

*   **Method 2: .env File**

    Create a `.env` file in the same directory as your Python script with the following content:

    ```
    DEFAULT_LLM_API_KEY="your_api_key"
    DEFAULT_LLM_BASE_URL="your_base_url"
    DEFAULT_LLM_MODEL_NAME="your_model_name"
    ```

### Step 6: Run the Example

```bash
python demo.py
```
