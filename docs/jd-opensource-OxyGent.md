## What is OxyGent?

**OxyGent** is an open-source, advanced Python framework designed to accelerate the development of production-ready intelligent systems. It unifies tools, models, and agents into a modular structure, providing developers with end-to-end pipelines for building, running, and evolving multi-agent systems.

## Key Features

*   üöÄ **Efficient Development:** Build, deploy, and evolve AI teams with unparalleled speed. Standardized components and clean Python interfaces enable rapid agent assembly, hot-swapping, and cross-scenario reuse.
*   ü§ù **Intelligent Collaboration:** Empower agents with dynamic planning, task decomposition, negotiation, and real-time adaptation.  OxyGent agents handle emergent challenges naturally while maintaining full auditability.
*   üï∏Ô∏è **Elastic Architecture:** Supports diverse agent topologies, from simple ReAct to complex hybrid patterns. Benefit from automated dependency mapping and visual debugging tools for performance optimization.
*   üîÅ **Continuous Evolution:** Built-in evaluation engines generate training data, allowing agents to continuously improve through knowledge feedback loops while maintaining full transparency.
*   üìà **Scalability:** Scale your collaborative intelligence linearly with OxyGent's distributed scheduler, which handles domain-wide optimization and real-time decision-making at any scale.

## Performance

The latest version of OxyGent (July 15, 2025) achieved 59.14 points in the [GAIA](https://huggingface.co/spaces/gaia-benchmark/leaderboard) benchmark.

### 3.2 Architecture Components

*   üì¶ **Repository:** Stores agents, tools, LLMs, data, and system files.
*   üõ† **Production Framework:** Manages the complete production chain, including registration, building, running, evaluation, and evolution.
*   üñ• **Service Framework:** Provides a complete business system server with storage and monitoring support.
*   ‚öôÔ∏è **Engineering Base:** Includes integrated modules such as databases and inference engines.

## Benefits

*   **For Developers:** Focus on business logic without reinventing the wheel.
*   **For Enterprises:** Replace siloed AI systems with a unified framework, reducing communication overhead.
*   **For Users:** Experience seamless teamwork from an intelligent agent ecosystem.

## Quick Start

Get up and running with OxyGent in minutes:

1.  **Set up your environment:**
    ```bash
    conda create -n oxy_env python==3.10
    conda activate oxy_env
    ```
    or
    ```bash
    curl -LsSf https://astral.sh/uv/install.sh | sh
    uv python install 3.10
    uv venv .venv --python 3.10
    source .venv/bin/activate
    ```

2.  **Install OxyGent:**
    ```bash
    pip install oxygent
    ```
    or
    ```bash
    uv pip install oxygent
    ```

3.  **Alternatively, for development:**
    *   Download **[Node.js](https://nodejs.org)**
    *   Install requirements:
        ```bash
        pip install -r requirements.txt
        brew install coreutils # maybe essential
        ```

4.  **Write and run a sample script (demo.py):**

```python
import os
from oxygent import MAS, Config, oxy, preset_tools

Config.set_agent_llm_model("default_llm")

oxy_space = [
   oxy.HttpLLM(
      name="default_llm",
      api_key=os.getenv("DEFAULT_LLM_API_KEY"),
      base_url=os.getenv("DEFAULT_LLM_BASE_URL"),
      model_name=os.getenv("DEFAULT_LLM_MODEL_NAME"),
      llm_params={"temperature": 0.01},
      semaphore=4,
   ),
   preset_tools.time_tools,
   oxy.ReActAgent(
      name="time_agent",
      desc="A tool that can query the time",
      tools=["time_tools"],
   ),
   preset_tools.file_tools,
   oxy.ReActAgent(
      name="file_agent",
      desc="A tool that can operate the file system",
      tools=["file_tools"],
   ),
   preset_tools.math_tools,
   oxy.ReActAgent(
      name="math_agent",
      desc="A tool that can perform mathematical calculations.",
      tools=["math_tools"],
   ),
   oxy.ReActAgent(
      is_master=True,
      name="master_agent",
      sub_agents=["time_agent", "file_agent", "math_agent"],
   ),
]

async def main():
   async with MAS(oxy_space=oxy_space) as mas:
      await mas.start_web_service(first_query="What time is it now? Please save it into time.txt.")

if __name__ == "__main__":
   import asyncio
   asyncio.run(main())
```

5.  **Configure your LLM settings:**
    ```bash
    export DEFAULT_LLM_API_KEY="your_api_key"
    export DEFAULT_LLM_BASE_URL="your_base_url"  # if you want to use a custom base URL
    export DEFAULT_LLM_MODEL_NAME="your_model_name"
    ```
    or create a `.env` file:
    ```
    DEFAULT_LLM_API_KEY="your_api_key"
    DEFAULT_LLM_BASE_URL="your_base_url"
    DEFAULT_LLM_MODEL_NAME="your_model_name"
    ```

6.  **Run the example:**

    ```bash
    python demo.py
    ```

7.  **View the output:**
