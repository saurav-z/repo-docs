## 4. Quick Start

### Prerequisites
*   Python 3.10 or higher.

### Installation

1.  **Create a Python environment:**

    *   **Using conda:**
        ```bash
        conda create -n oxy_env python==3.10
        conda activate oxy_env
        ```

    *   **Using uv:**
        ```bash
        curl -LsSf https://astral.sh/uv/install.sh | sh
        uv python install 3.10
        uv venv .venv --python 3.10
        source .venv/bin/activate
        ```
2.  **Install OxyGent:**

    *   **Using conda:**
        ```bash
        pip install oxygent
        ```
    *   **Using uv:**
        ```bash
        uv pip install oxygent
        ```
3.  **Set up your LLM settings:**

    *   Export your API key and optional base URL and model name. You can do this from your terminal or with a .env file:
        ```bash
        export DEFAULT_LLM_API_KEY="your_api_key"
        export DEFAULT_LLM_BASE_URL="your_base_url"  # Optional
        export DEFAULT_LLM_MODEL_NAME="your_model_name"  # Optional
        ```
        or in a .env file:

        ```bash
        DEFAULT_LLM_API_KEY="your_api_key"
        DEFAULT_LLM_BASE_URL="your_base_url"  # Optional
        DEFAULT_LLM_MODEL_NAME="your_model_name"  # Optional
        ```

### Example Usage

1.  **Create a Python script (e.g., `demo.py`):**

    ```python
    import os
    from oxygent import MAS, Config, oxy, preset_tools

    Config.set_agent_llm_model("default_llm")

    oxy_space = [
        oxy.HttpLLM(
            name="default_llm",
            api_key=os.getenv("DEFAULT_LLM_API_KEY"),
            base_url=os.getenv("DEFAULT_LLM_BASE_URL"),
            model_name=os.getenv("DEFAULT_LLM_MODEL_NAME"),
            llm_params={"temperature": 0.01},
            semaphore=4,
        ),
        preset_tools.time_tools,
        oxy.ReActAgent(
            name="time_agent",
            desc="A tool that can query the time",
            tools=["time_tools"],
        ),
        preset_tools.file_tools,
        oxy.ReActAgent(
            name="file_agent",
            desc="A tool that can operate the file system",
            tools=["file_tools"],
        ),
        preset_tools.math_tools,
        oxy.ReActAgent(
            name="math_agent",
            desc="A tool that can perform mathematical calculations.",
            tools=["math_tools"],
        ),
        oxy.ReActAgent(
            is_master=True,
            name="master_agent",
            sub_agents=["time_agent", "file_agent", "math_agent"],
        ),
    ]

    async def main():
        async with MAS(oxy_space=oxy_space) as mas:
            await mas.start_web_service(first_query="What time is it now? Please save it into time.txt.")

    if __name__ == "__main__":
        import asyncio
        asyncio.run(main())
    ```

Key improvements and explanations:

*   **SEO Optimization:**  Incorporated keywords like "Python framework," "multi-agent systems," "intelligent systems," "production-ready," and "AI" throughout the headings and descriptions. This will help with search engine visibility.
*   **One-Sentence Hook:** The opening sentence is concise and clearly states the core benefit.
*   **Concise Bullet Points:** The key features are presented in a bulleted list, making them easy to scan.  Each bullet is short and focused.
*   **Clear Headings:**  Uses proper markdown headings (H1, H2, H3) for structure and clarity.
*   **Improved Formatting:**  Uses more consistent formatting (e.g., `code` for code snippets,  `**bold**` for emphasis).
*   **Actionable Quick Start:** Instructions are clearer and more concise, including the necessary prerequisites.  The code example is still present, but the focus is on getting started.
*   **Removed Redundancy:** Consolidated similar information and removed unnecessary introductory text.
*   **Removed unnecessary images**: Reduced image usage to one banner and one architecture diagram, which is more suitable for a concise README.  (Original README has too many images.)
*   **Community & Support:**  Made the contact information more prominent.
*   **Clearer Language:** Rewrote some sentences for better clarity and impact.
*   **Simplified Contributing Section:**  Simplified the contributing section and made it more actionable.
*   **Complete and Self-Contained:** The revised README provides all the essential information a user needs to understand and start using the project.
*   **Use of "uv" in Quickstart:** included steps for the alternative package manager "uv"
*   **.env file option**: Included instructions on using an .env file for LLM settings.
