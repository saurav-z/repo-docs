## Key Features of OxyGent

*   **Modular Multi-Agent Framework:** Build, deploy, and evolve AI teams with unparalleled efficiency using modular components.
*   **Intelligent Collaboration:** Facilitates dynamic planning, task decomposition, and negotiation among agents for robust solutions.
*   **Elastic Architecture:** Supports diverse agent topologies, providing flexibility and scalability.
*   **Continuous Evolution:** Leverages built-in evaluation engines and feedback loops to continuously improve agent performance.
*   **Scalability:** Employs a distributed scheduler for linear cost growth and exponential gains in collaborative intelligence.

## 1. Project Overview

**OxyGent** is an open-source framework designed to unify tools, models, and agents into modular "Oxy" components. This framework empowers developers to create end-to-end AI pipelines with ease, facilitating the seamless building, running, and evolution of multi-agent systems.

## 2. Core Features - Deep Dive

*   **Efficient Development:** Assemble agents quickly with standardized Oxy components. Supports hot-swapping and cross-scenario reuse through clean Python interfaces.
*   **Intelligent Collaboration:** Agents intelligently decompose tasks, negotiate, and adapt in real-time, ensuring full auditability.
*   **Elastic Architecture:** Supports a variety of agent topologies (e.g., ReAct, hybrid planning). Automated dependency mapping and debugging tools streamline performance optimization.
*   **Continuous Evolution:** Evaluation engines auto-generate training data, allowing agents to learn from interactions.
*   **Scalability:**  The distributed scheduler enables domain-wide optimization and real-time decision-making at any scale.

**Performance:** In the July 15, 2025, GAIA benchmark, OxyGent achieved 59.14 points, closely approaching the top open-source system, OWL, which scored 60.8 points.

4.  **Evolve** systems automatically.

## 5. Quick Start

Get started with OxyGent in these easy steps:

1.  **Set Up Your Environment:**

    *   **Conda:**
        ```bash
        conda create -n oxy_env python==3.10
        conda activate oxy_env
        ```

    *   **UV:**
        ```bash
        curl -LsSf https://astral.sh/uv/install.sh | sh
        uv python install 3.10
        uv venv .venv --python 3.10
        source .venv/bin/activate
        ```

2.  **Install OxyGent:**

    *   **Conda:**
        ```bash
        pip install oxygent
        ```
    *   **UV:**
        ```bash
        uv pip install oxygent
        ```

3.  **Configure the Development Environment (Optional):**

    *   Install **[Node.js](https://nodejs.org)**.
    *   Install required dependencies:
        ```bash
        pip install -r requirements.txt # or in uv
        brew install coreutils # maybe essential
        ```

4.  **Write a Sample Python Script:**
    ```python
    import os
    from oxygent import MAS, Config, oxy, preset_tools

    Config.set_agent_llm_model("default_llm")

    oxy_space = [
        oxy.HttpLLM(
            name="default_llm",
            api_key=os.getenv("DEFAULT_LLM_API_KEY"),
            base_url=os.getenv("DEFAULT_LLM_BASE_URL"),
            model_name=os.getenv("DEFAULT_LLM_MODEL_NAME"),
            llm_params={"temperature": 0.01},
            semaphore=4,
        ),
        preset_tools.time_tools,
        oxy.ReActAgent(
            name="time_agent",
            desc="A tool that can query the time",
            tools=["time_tools"],
        ),
        preset_tools.file_tools,
        oxy.ReActAgent(
            name="file_agent",
            desc="A tool that can operate the file system",
            tools=["file_tools"],
        ),
        preset_tools.math_tools,
        oxy.ReActAgent(
            name="math_agent",
            desc="A tool that can perform mathematical calculations.",
            tools=["math_tools"],
        ),
        oxy.ReActAgent(
            is_master=True,
            name="master_agent",
            sub_agents=["time_agent", "file_agent", "math_agent"],
        ),
    ]

    async def main():
        async with MAS(oxy_space=oxy_space) as mas:
            await mas.start_web_service(first_query="What time is it now? Please save it into time.txt.")

    if __name__ == "__main__":
        import asyncio
        asyncio.run(main())
    ```

5.  **Configure LLM Settings:**

    ```bash
    export DEFAULT_LLM_API_KEY="your_api_key"
    export DEFAULT_LLM_BASE_URL="your_base_url"  # if you want to use a custom base URL
    export DEFAULT_LLM_MODEL_NAME="your_model_name"
    ```
    Or create a `.env` file:
    ```bash
    DEFAULT_LLM_API_KEY="your_api_key"
    DEFAULT_LLM_BASE_URL="your_base_url"
    DEFAULT_LLM_MODEL_NAME="your_model_name"
    ```
