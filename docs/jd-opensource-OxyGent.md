## 1. Project Overview

OxyGent is an open-source framework designed to unify tools, models, and agents into modular components. It provides developers with end-to-end pipelines for building, running, and evolving multi-agent systems seamlessly and with limitless extensibility.

## 2. Core Features - Detailed

*   **Efficient Development:** OxyGent's modular multi-agent framework allows for the efficient building, deployment, and evolution of AI teams. Its standardized components enable rapid agent assembly, hot-swapping, and cross-scenario reuse via clean Python interfaces, eliminating the need for complex configurations.
*   **Intelligent Collaboration:** This framework enhances collaboration through dynamic planning, task decomposition, and intelligent solution negotiation. Agents can adapt in real-time to changing conditions, maintaining full auditability of all decisions.
*   **Elastic Architecture:** The underlying architecture supports any agent topology, from simple ReAct agents to complex hybrid planning models. Automated dependency mapping and visual debugging tools facilitate performance optimization across distributed systems.
*   **Continuous Evolution:**  Built-in evaluation engines generate training data automatically. Your agents continuously improve through knowledge feedback loops while maintaining full transparency.
*   **Scalability:** OxyGent's distributed scheduler delivers exponential gains in collaborative intelligence with linear cost growth, effortlessly handling domain-wide optimization and real-time decision-making at scale.

2.  **Deploy** with a single command.
3.  **Monitor** every decision with full transparency.
4.  **Evolve** automatically, enabling self-improving systems.

## 5. Quick Start

**Prerequisites:** Python 3.10 or higher, pip, and an environment to install OxyGent.

**Installation (using conda or uv):**

```bash
# Using conda
conda create -n oxy_env python==3.10
conda activate oxy_env
pip install oxygent

# or (uv)
curl -LsSf https://astral.sh/uv/install.sh | sh
uv python install 3.10 
uv venv .venv --python 3.10
source .venv/bin/activate
uv pip install oxygent
```

**Development Environment Setup (optional):**

1.  Download **[Node.js](https://nodejs.org)**
2.  Install required dependencies:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt # or in uv
brew install coreutils # maybe essential
```

**Example Python Script:**

```python
import os
from oxygent import MAS, Config, oxy, preset_tools

Config.set_agent_llm_model("default_llm")

oxy_space = [
   oxy.HttpLLM(
      name="default_llm",
      api_key=os.getenv("DEFAULT_LLM_API_KEY"),
      base_url=os.getenv("DEFAULT_LLM_BASE_URL"),
      model_name=os.getenv("DEFAULT_LLM_MODEL_NAME"),
      llm_params={"temperature": 0.01},
      semaphore=4,
   ),
   preset_tools.time_tools,
   oxy.ReActAgent(
      name="time_agent",
      desc="A tool that can query the time",
      tools=["time_tools"],
   ),
   preset_tools.file_tools,
   oxy.ReActAgent(
      name="file_agent",
      desc="A tool that can operate the file system",
      tools=["file_tools"],
   ),
   preset_tools.math_tools,
   oxy.ReActAgent(
      name="math_agent",
      desc="A tool that can perform mathematical calculations.",
      tools=["math_tools"],
   ),
   oxy.ReActAgent(
      is_master=True,
      name="master_agent",
      sub_agents=["time_agent", "file_agent", "math_agent"],
   ),
]

async def main():
   async with MAS(oxy_space=oxy_space) as mas:
      await mas.start_web_service(first_query="What time is it now? Please save it into time.txt.")

if __name__ == "__main__":
   import asyncio
   asyncio.run(main())
```

**LLM Configuration:**

```bash
export DEFAULT_LLM_API_KEY="your_api_key"
export DEFAULT_LLM_BASE_URL="your_base_url"  # if you want to use a custom base URL
export DEFAULT_LLM_MODEL_NAME="your_model_name"  
```

or, create a `.env` file:

```
DEFAULT_LLM_API_KEY="your_api_key"
DEFAULT_LLM_BASE_URL="your_base_url"
DEFAULT_LLM_MODEL_NAME="your_model_name"
```

**Run the Example:**

```bash
python demo.py
```
