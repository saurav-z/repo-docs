## Key Features

*   **Efficient Development:** Build, deploy, and evolve AI teams rapidly with modular, reusable components that snap together seamlessly.  Avoid complex configurations with clean Python interfaces.
*   **Intelligent Collaboration:** Enables dynamic planning where agents decompose tasks, negotiate, and adapt in real-time.  Maintains full auditability of all decisions.
*   **Elastic Architecture:** Supports diverse agent topologies, from simple to complex, with automated dependency mapping and visual debugging.
*   **Continuous Evolution:** Agents continuously improve via built-in evaluation engines and knowledge feedback loops, with complete transparency.
*   **Scalability:**  Utilizes a distributed scheduler for linear cost growth and exponential gains in collaborative intelligence.

**OxyGent is at the forefront of open-source AI, achieving impressive results in the GAIA benchmark, demonstrating its capacity for advanced AI system development.**

4.  **Evolve** automatically.

## Quick Start

1.  **Set up Python Environment:**

    *   **Conda:**

        ```bash
        conda create -n oxy_env python==3.10
        conda activate oxy_env
        ```

    *   **uv:**

        ```bash
        curl -LsSf https://astral.sh/uv/install.sh | sh
        uv python install 3.10 
        uv venv .venv --python 3.10
        source .venv/bin/activate
        ```
2.  **Install OxyGent:**

    *   **Conda:**

        ```bash
        pip install oxygent
        ```

    *   **uv:**

        ```bash
        uv pip install oxygent
        ```

3.  **Development Environment Setup (Optional):**

    *   Download [Node.js](https://nodejs.org)
    *   Install Requirements:

        ```bash
        pip install -r requirements.txt # or in uv
        brew install coreutils # maybe essential
        ```

4.  **Create a Sample Python Script (demo.py):**

    ```python
    import os
    from oxygent import MAS, Config, oxy, preset_tools

    Config.set_agent_llm_model("default_llm")

    oxy_space = [
        oxy.HttpLLM(
            name="default_llm",
            api_key=os.getenv("DEFAULT_LLM_API_KEY"),
            base_url=os.getenv("DEFAULT_LLM_BASE_URL"),
            model_name=os.getenv("DEFAULT_LLM_MODEL_NAME"),
            llm_params={"temperature": 0.01},
            semaphore=4,
        ),
        preset_tools.time_tools,
        oxy.ReActAgent(
            name="time_agent",
            desc="A tool that can query the time",
            tools=["time_tools"],
        ),
        preset_tools.file_tools,
        oxy.ReActAgent(
            name="file_agent",
            desc="A tool that can operate the file system",
            tools=["file_tools"],
        ),
        preset_tools.math_tools,
        oxy.ReActAgent(
            name="math_agent",
            desc="A tool that can perform mathematical calculations.",
            tools=["math_tools"],
        ),
        oxy.ReActAgent(
            is_master=True,
            name="master_agent",
            sub_agents=["time_agent", "file_agent", "math_agent"],
        ),
    ]

    async def main():
        async with MAS(oxy_space=oxy_space) as mas:
            await mas.start_web_service(first_query="What time is it now? Please save it into time.txt.")

    if __name__ == "__main__":
        import asyncio
        asyncio.run(main())
    ```

5.  **Configure LLM Settings (e.g., using environment variables or .env file):**

    ```bash
    export DEFAULT_LLM_API_KEY="your_api_key"
    export DEFAULT_LLM_BASE_URL="your_base_url"  # if you want to use a custom base URL
    export DEFAULT_LLM_MODEL_NAME="your_model_name"
    ```

    OR

    ```bash
    # create a .env file
    DEFAULT_LLM_API_KEY="your_api_key"
    DEFAULT_LLM_BASE_URL="your_base_url"
    DEFAULT_LLM_MODEL_NAME="your_model_name"
    ```

6.  **Run the Example:**

    ```bash
    python demo.py
    ```

7.  **View the Output:**
