## Method

FSA reorders the kernel loops in the NSA kernel design to optimize performance, which is achieved by decoupling the computation into three key kernels: the main kernel, the reduction kernel, and the online softmax kernel. This approach reduces unnecessary memory access and computations for padded data, while avoiding `atomic` additions for accumulating attention results.

The concrete computation process comparison between NSA (left) and FSA main kernel (right) can be visualized as follows:

## Advantages

üöÄ FSA significantly lowers kernel-level memory access volume and computations, providing substantial speedups.

Under varied GQA group sizes, NSA hyperparameters block size $B_K=64$ and topk-k value $T=16$, 64K sequence length, 4 KV heads, the execution latency comparisons between NSA and our method are as follows (execution latency of our method is normalized to 1):

## Features

FSA provides an optimized kernel implementation for NSA selected attention module. Without modifying NSA algorithm, FSA provides an efficient Triton-based implementation for GQA group sizes smaller than 8, which is more popular on state-of-the-art large language models (LLMs), on modern high-performance NVIDIA GPUs. For GQA group sizes larger than or equal to 8, FSA usually chooses to fall back to the original NSA implementation for better performance.

FSA is currently well tested with:
- NVIDIA Ampere or Hopper GPUs (e.g., A100 SXM, H20, H100 PCIe, H100 NVL, H100 SXM, H200 SXM);
- Datatype of fp16 and bf16;
- The same head dimension (less than or equal to 256) across query, key, and value;
- Varied GQA group sizes, ranging from 1 to 16;
- Training and inference (prefill).

## Usage

### Instantiate FSA Module

Use the `FlashSparseAttention` class:

```python
import torch
from fsa.module.fsa import FlashSparseAttention, RopeConfig

FSA = (
    FlashSparseAttention(
        hidden_size=4096,
        num_q_heads=4,
        num_kv_heads=4,
        head_dim=128,
        kernel_size=32,
        kernel_stride=16,
        block_size=64,
        topk=16,
        init_blocks=1,
        local_blocks=2,
        window_size=512,
        rope_config=RopeConfig(
            max_position_embeddings=131072,
            head_dim=128,
            rope_theta=500000,
            rope_scaling={
                "factor": 8.0,
                "high_freq_factor": 4.0,
                "low_freq_factor": 1.0,
                "original_max_position_embeddings": 8192,
                "rope_type": "llama3",
            },
        )
    )
    .cuda()
    .to(torch.bfloat16)
)
# random input
seqlens = torch.LongTensor([65536, 32768]).int().cuda()

cu_seqlens = torch.cat(
    [
        torch.zeros(1, dtype=torch.int32, device="cuda"),
        torch.cumsum(seqlens, dim=0),
    ],
    dim=0,
).to(torch.int32)
x = torch.randn(cu_seqlens[-1], 4096, device="cuda", dtype=torch.bfloat16)

y = FSA(x, cu_seqlens)
loss = (y * torch.randn_like(y)).sum(-1).mean()
loss.backward()
```

Under the hood, the [``FSATopkSparseAttention``](fsa/ops/FSA_topk_sparse_attention.py) class is called, provding the optimized kernels that accelerate the NSA selected attention module.

### Train with FSA

Replace the attention module with `FlashSparseAttention` and compute `cu_seqlens`.  See [`SparseLlamaAttention`](test/train.py) for an example.

## Evaluation

### Benchmark FSA Module

Run benchmarking with:

```bash
scripts/run_unit_test.sh
```

### Benchmark FSA Selected Attention Module

Run benchmarking with:

```bash
scripts/run_unit_test_sel_attn.sh
```

> [!Tip]
>  Adjust `gqa`, `seqlen`, `block_size`, and `topk` in the scripts for comprehensive benchmarking. Benchmarking the FSA selected attention module often yields higher speedups.

## Performance

### Kernel Performance

> Performance comparison of Triton-based FSA, NSA, and Full Attention (enabled by Flash Attention) kernels under various configurations. The tuple ($64$, $16$) / ($128$, $8$) represents the block size $BK$ and top-k value $Topk$, respectively. For FSA and NSA, the execution latency is composed of compressed, selected, and sliding attention; for Full Attention, the execution latency is the Flash Attention kernel execution latency.

### End-to-end Performance
