**TL;DR: ViPE is a useful open-source spatial AI tool for annotating camera poses and dense depth maps from raw videos!**

**Contributors**: NVIDIA (Spatial Intelligence Lab, Dynamic Vision Lab, NVIDIA Issac, NVIDIA Research).

**Full Abstract**: Accurate 3D geometric perception is an important prerequisite for a wide range of spatial AI systems. While state-of-the-art methods depend on large-scale training data, acquiring consistent and precise 3D annotations from in-the-wild videos remains a key challenge. In this work, we introduce ViPE, a handy and versatile video processing engine designed to bridge this gap. ViPE efficiently estimates camera intrinsics, camera motion, and dense, near-metric depth maps from unconstrained raw videos. It is robust to diverse scenarios, including dynamic selfie videos, cinematic shots, or dashcams, and supports various camera models such as pinhole, wide-angle, and 360° panoramas. 
We use ViPE to annotate a large-scale collection of videos. This collection includes around 100K real-world internet videos, 1M high-quality AI-generated videos, and 2K panoramic videos, totaling approximately 96M frames -- all annotated with accurate camera poses and dense depth maps. We open source ViPE and the annotated dataset with the hope to accelerate the development of spatial AI systems.

## Installation

To ensure the reproducibility, we recommend creating the runtime environment using [conda](https://docs.conda.io/projects/conda/en/latest/user-guide/getting-started.html).

```bash
# Create a new conda environment and install 3rd-party dependencies
conda env create -f envs/base.yml
conda activate vipe
pip install -r envs/requirements.txt

# Build the project and install it into the current environment
# Omit the -e flag to install the project as a regular package
pip install --no-build-isolation -e .
```

## Usage

### Using the ViPE CLI

Once the python package is installed, you can use the `vipe` CLI to process raw videos in mp4 format.

```bash
# Replace YOUR_VIDEO.mp4 with the path to your video. We provide sample videos in assets/examples.
vipe infer YOUR_VIDEO.mp4
# Additional options:
#   --output: Output directory (default: vipe_results)
#   --visualize: Enable visualization of intermediate and final results (default: false)
#   --pipeline: Pipeline configuration to use (default: default)
```

One can visualize the results that ViPE produces by running (supported by `viser`):
```bash
vipe visualize vipe_results/
# Please modify the above vipe_results/ path to the output directory of your choice.
```

> We found that running [video-depth-anything](https://github.com/DepthAnything/Video-Depth-Anything) might eat up too much of GPU memory. To that end we provide a `no_vda` config that produces less temporally-stable depth (but empirically more 3D consistent) maps. This can be triggered by adding `--pipeline no_vda` to the `vipe infer` command.

### Using the `run.py` script

The `run.py` script is a more flexible way to run ViPE. Compared to the CLI, the script supports running on multiple videos at once and allows more fine-grained control over the pipeline with `hydra` configs. It also provides an example of using `vipe` as a library in your own project.

Example usages:

```bash
# Running the full pipeline.
python run.py pipeline=default streams=raw_mp4_stream streams.base_path=YOUR_VIDEO_OR_DIR_PATH

# Running the pose-only pipeline without depth estimation.
python run.py pipeline=default streams=raw_mp4_stream streams.base_path=YOUR_VIDEO_OR_DIR_PATH pipeline.post.depth_align_model=null
```

### Converting to COLMAP format

You can use the following script to convert the ViPE results to COLMAP format. For example:
```bash
python scripts/vipe_to_colmap.py vipe_results/ --sequence dog_example
```
This will unproject the dense depth maps to create the 3D point cloud. 
Alternatively for a more lightweight and 3D consistent point cloud, you can add the `--use_slam_map` flag to the above command. This requires you to run the full pipeline with `pipeline.output.save_slam_map=true` to save the additional information.

## Downloading the Dataset

**This section is still under construction pending the final legal approval. We will make the HF link available as soon as possible.**

![dataset](assets/dataset.gif)

Together with ViPE we release a large-scale dataset containing ~1M high-quality videos with accurate camera poses and dense depth maps. Specifications of the datasets are listed below:

| Dataset Name   | # Videos | # Frames | Hugging Face Link                                            | License      | Prefix |
| -------------- | -------- | -------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ | ------------ | ------ |
| Dynpose-100K++ | 99,501   | 15.8M    | [Link](https://huggingface.co/datasets/nvidia/vipe-dynpose-100kpp) | CC-BY-NC 4.0 | `dpsp` |
| Wild-SDG-1M    | 966,448  | 78.2M    | [Link](https://huggingface.co/datasets/nvidia/vipe-wild-sdg-1m) | CC-BY-NC 4.0 | `wsdg` |
| Web360         | 2,114    | 212K     | [Link](https://huggingface.co/datasets/nvidia/vipe-web360)   | CC-BY 4.0    | `w360` |

You can download the datasets using the following utility script:

```bash
# Replace YOUR_PREFIX with the prefix of the dataset to be downloaded (see prefix column in the table above)
# You can also use more specific prefixes, e.g. wsdg-003e2c86 to download a specific shard of the dataset.
python scripts/download_dataset.py --prefix YOUR_PREFIX --output_base YOUR_OUTPUT_DIR --rgb --depth
```

> Note that the depth component is very large and you might expect a long downloading time. For `rgb` component of the Dynpose-100K++ dataset, we directly retrieve the RGB frames from YouTube. You have to `pip install yt_dlp ffmpeg-python` to use this feature. Please refer to the original [Dynpose-100K dataset](https://huggingface.co/datasets/nvidia/dynpose-100k) for alternative approaches to retrieve the videos.

The dataset itself can be visualized using the same visualization script:
```bash
vipe visualize YOUR_OUTPUT_DIR
```
