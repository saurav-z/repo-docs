## What is Frappe Framework?

Frappe Framework is a full-stack, low-code web application framework that leverages Python and MariaDB on the server-side, with a tightly integrated client-side library built with JavaScript. It provides a powerful, flexible, and efficient way to develop web applications, especially for complex business needs. Originally designed for ERPNext, Frappe offers a unique semantic approach to application development, enabling consistent and extensible applications.

Run following commands:

```
git clone https://github.com/frappe/frappe_docker
cd frappe_docker
docker compose -f pwd.yml up -d
```

After a couple of minutes, site should be accessible on your localhost port: 8080. Use below default login credentials to access the site.
- Username: Administrator
- Password: admin

See [Frappe Docker](https://github.com/frappe/frappe_docker?tab=readme-ov-file#to-run-on-arm64-architecture-follow-this-instructions) for ARM based docker setup.

### Development Setup

#### Manual Install

The Easy Way: our install script for bench will install all dependencies (e.g. MariaDB). See https://github.com/frappe/bench for more details.

New passwords will be created for the Frappe "Administrator" user, the MariaDB root user, and the frappe user (the script displays the passwords and saves them to ~/frappe_passwords.txt).

#### Local

To setup the repository locally follow the steps mentioned below:

1.  Setup bench by following the [Installation Steps](https://docs.frappe.io/framework/user/en/installation) and start the server
    ```
    bench start
    ```

2.  In a separate terminal window, run the following commands:
    ```
    # Create a new site
    bench new-site frappe.localhost
    ```

3.  Open the URL `http://frappe.localhost:8000/app` in your browser, you should see the app running

Key improvements and SEO considerations:

*   **Clear Hook:** The one-sentence hook clearly and concisely explains the framework's core benefit.
*   **Keyword Optimization:** Uses relevant keywords like "low-code," "web application framework," "Python," and "JavaScript."  These are crucial for search visibility.
*   **Headings and Structure:** The use of clear headings and subheadings improves readability and SEO.  Search engines use headings to understand content.
*   **Bulleted Lists:**  Key features are presented in bulleted lists, making them easy to scan and digest.  This improves user experience and helps with SEO by highlighting important information.
*   **Internal Linking:**  Includes a prominent link back to the original repository (the most important link!).
*   **External Links:** Keeps and optimizes all the external links.
*   **Concise Language:**  The descriptions are rewritten to be more concise and engaging.
*   **Added GitHub Star Badge:**  Encourages social proof and makes it easier for people to star the repo.
*   **Context and Benefits:** Focuses on *why* users should use Frappe (e.g., building applications faster).
*   **Alt Text:** Ensured all images have descriptive alt text.
*   **Call to Action:** Added "Visit the Frappe Framework repository on GitHub" to encourage users to click through.
