## Core Functionality

### Data Access & Retrieval

*   Get historical stock data (e.g., `ak.stock_zh_a_hist`)
*   Retrieve US stock data (e.g., `ak.stock_us_daily`)

### Example: Fetching Historical Stock Data

```python
import akshare as ak

stock_zh_a_hist_df = ak.stock_zh_a_hist(symbol="000001", period="daily", start_date="20230101", end_date='20231101', adjust="")
print(stock_zh_a_hist_df.head())
```

### Example: Data Visualization

```python
import akshare as ak
import mplfinance as mpf  # Install using: pip install mplfinance

stock_us_daily_df = ak.stock_us_daily(symbol="AAPL", adjust="qfq")
stock_us_daily_df = stock_us_daily_df.set_index(["date"])
stock_us_daily_df = stock_us_daily_df["2020-04-01": "2020-04-29"]
mpf.plot(stock_us_daily_df, type="candle", mav=(3, 6, 9), volume=True, show_nontrading=False)
```
