## Getting Started

### Installation

```bash

```

For China-specific data:

```bash
pip install akshare -i http://mirrors.aliyun.com/pypi/simple/ --trusted-host=mirrors.aliyun.com  --upgrade
```

### Usage Example

Fetch historical stock data:

```python
import akshare as ak

stock_zh_a_hist_df = ak.stock_zh_a_hist(symbol="000001", period="daily", start_date="20170301", end_date='20231022', adjust="")
print(stock_zh_a_hist_df)
```

### Plotting Example

Visualize US stock data using `mplfinance`:

```python
import akshare as ak
import mplfinance as mpf  # Please install mplfinance: pip install mplfinance

stock_us_daily_df = ak.stock_us_daily(symbol="AAPL", adjust="qfq")
stock_us_daily_df = stock_us_daily_df.set_index(["date"])
stock_us_daily_df = stock_us_daily_df["2020-04-01": "2020-04-29"]
mpf.plot(stock_us_daily_df, type="candle", mav=(3, 6, 9), volume=True, show_nontrading=False)
```
