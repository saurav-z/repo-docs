# PyGMT: Create stunning maps and figures with a Pythonic interface to the Generic Mapping Tools

**PyGMT provides a user-friendly Python interface for the powerful Generic Mapping Tools (GMT), empowering you to create publication-quality maps and figures with ease.** [Visit the PyGMT Repository](https://github.com/GenericMappingTools/pygmt).

## Key Features

*   **Pythonic Interface:** Access the full power of GMT through an intuitive and Python-friendly API.
*   **Geospatial Data Processing:** Process and visualize geospatial and geophysical data.
*   **Publication-Quality Output:** Generate high-resolution maps and figures suitable for scientific publications.
*   **Integration with the Scientific Python Ecosystem:** Works seamlessly with `NumPy`, `Pandas`, `xarray`, and `GeoPandas` for data input and manipulation.
*   **Interactive Visualization:** Create rich, interactive visualizations in Jupyter notebooks.
*   **Direct GMT C API Access:** Efficiently interacts with the GMT C API using `ctypes`, avoiding system calls.
*   **Rich Documentation and Examples:** Access comprehensive documentation, tutorials, and a gallery of examples to get you started quickly.

## What is PyGMT?

PyGMT is a Python library that serves as a bridge between the versatile command-line GMT and the Python environment. It enables users to harness the full potential of GMT for geospatial data processing and visualization while leveraging the convenience and power of Python.

## Project Goals

*   Make GMT more accessible to both new and experienced users.
*   Offer a Pythonic API for easy interaction with GMT.
*   Use the GMT C API directly using ctypes for maximum efficiency.
*   Provide strong integration with the scientific Python ecosystem.

## Getting Started

### Installation

Install PyGMT using `mamba` or `conda`:

```bash
mamba install --channel conda-forge pygmt
# or
conda install --channel conda-forge pygmt
```

For detailed installation instructions, see the [full installation instructions](https://www.pygmt.org/latest/install.html).

### Basic Example

Create a global map with a simple example:

```python
import pygmt
fig = pygmt.Figure()
fig.coast(projection="N15c", region="g", frame=True, land="tan", water="lightblue")
fig.text(position="MC", text="PyGMT", font="80p,Helvetica-Bold,red@75")
fig.show()
```
