## What is PyGMT?

PyGMT is a Python library that serves as an interface for the Generic Mapping Tools (GMT), offering a streamlined approach to geospatial and geophysical data processing and visualization. It is an essential tool for scientists and researchers in Earth sciences, oceanography, and related fields.

## Project Goals:

*   Enhance GMT accessibility for new users.
*   Develop a Pythonic API for GMT.
*   Directly interface with the GMT C API, ensuring efficient data processing.
*   Provide rich display capabilities within the Jupyter notebook environment.
*   Integrate smoothly with the core scientific Python ecosystem (NumPy, Pandas, xarray, GeoPandas).

## Getting Started

### Installation

Install PyGMT easily using `mamba` or `conda`:

```bash
mamba install --channel conda-forge pygmt
```

Or with `conda`:

```bash
conda install --channel conda-forge pygmt
```

For detailed installation instructions, please refer to the [full installation instructions](https://www.pygmt.org/latest/install.html).

### Example

Start by importing the `pygmt` library and create your first map:

```python
import pygmt
fig = pygmt.Figure()
fig.coast(projection="N15c", region="g", frame=True, land="tan", water="lightblue")
fig.text(position="MC", text="PyGMT", font="80p,Helvetica-Bold,red@75")
fig.show()
```
