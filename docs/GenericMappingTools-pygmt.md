*   **Geospatial Data Processing:** Process and visualize a wide range of geospatial and geophysical data.
*   **Publication-Quality Maps:** Create stunning maps and figures ready for scientific publications.
*   **Integration with the Scientific Python Ecosystem:** Seamlessly works with NumPy, Pandas, Xarray, and GeoPandas for data input.
*   **Direct C API Interface:** Utilizes a direct interface with the GMT C API using ctypes for performance.
*   **Jupyter Notebook Support:** Provides rich display capabilities within Jupyter notebooks.
*   **Versatile Data Handling:** Supports `numpy.ndarray`, `pandas.DataFrame`, `xarray.DataArray`, and `geopandas.GeoDataFrame`.

## About PyGMT

PyGMT is a powerful Python library built to empower scientists and researchers in creating high-quality maps and processing geospatial data. It offers a user-friendly Python interface for the widely-used Generic Mapping Tools (GMT), known for its command-line tools. PyGMT brings the power of GMT to the Python world, allowing you to visualize, analyze, and manipulate your data with ease.

## Project Goals

*   **Improved Accessibility:** Make GMT more accessible to both new and experienced users.
*   **Pythonic API:** Design a Pythonic API to ensure intuitive and efficient interactions.
*   **Direct C API Integration:** Interface directly with the GMT C API, enhancing performance through the use of ctypes.
*   **Enhanced Jupyter Support:** Offer rich display support within Jupyter notebooks.
*   **Ecosystem Integration:** Seamless integration with the scientific Python ecosystem, supporting data formats like `numpy.ndarray`, `pandas.DataFrame`, `xarray.DataArray`, and `geopandas.GeoDataFrame`.

## Quickstart

### Installation

Install PyGMT with [mamba](https://mamba.readthedocs.org/):

```bash
mamba install --channel conda-forge pygmt
```

Alternatively, use [conda](https://docs.conda.io/projects/conda/en/latest/user-guide/index.html):

```bash
conda install --channel conda-forge pygmt
```

For more installation options, consult the [full installation instructions](https://www.pygmt.org/latest/install.html).

### Getting Started

Get started by running a [Python interpreter](https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/interpreter.html) or [Jupyter notebook](https://docs.jupyter.org/en/latest/running.html) and executing the following example:

```python
import pygmt
fig = pygmt.Figure()
fig.coast(projection="N15c", region="g", frame=True, land="tan", water="lightblue")
fig.text(position="MC", text="PyGMT", font="80p,Helvetica-Bold,red@75")
fig.show()
```

This will create a global map with colored land and water, as well as the text "PyGMT." For more detailed examples, check out the [Gallery](https://www.pygmt.org/latest/gallery/index.html) and [Tutorials](https://www.pygmt.org/latest/tutorials/index.html).
