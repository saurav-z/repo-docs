## ‚òØÔ∏è HunyuanWorld 1.0 Overview

### Abstract

HunyuanWorld 1.0 addresses the challenge of generating immersive 3D worlds from text and images by combining video-based and 3D-based approaches. This framework leverages panoramic images as 360¬∞ world proxies and enables generation of diverse 3D worlds with 360¬∞ immersive experiences, mesh export capabilities, and disentangled object representations.
