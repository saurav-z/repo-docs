**Disclaimer:** This software is designed for ethical and responsible use ONLY.  Do not target systems without explicit permission.

## Key Features

*   **Modular Architecture:** Execute specific tasks with independent modules, giving you granular control.
*   **Multi-Protocol & Multithreaded Scanning:** Supports various protocols (HTTP/HTTPS, FTP, SSH, etc.) and parallel scanning for speed.
*   **Comprehensive Reporting:** Generate reports in HTML, JSON, CSV, and plain text formats.
*   **Database & Drift Detection:**  Store and compare scan results to track changes and identify new vulnerabilities.
*   **CLI, REST API & Web UI:** Choose your preferred interface for defining scans and viewing results.
*   **Evasion Techniques:** Utilize delays, proxies, and user-agent randomization to avoid detection.
*   **Flexible Target Input:** Accept single IPs, ranges, CIDR blocks, domains, and URLs.

## Use Cases

*   **Penetration Testing:** Automate reconnaissance and vulnerability assessments.
*   **Recon & Vulnerability Assessment:** Discover hosts, services, and credentials.
*   **Attack Surface Mapping:** Quickly identify exposed assets and services.
*   **Bug Bounty Recon:** Streamline reconnaissance for bug bounty programs.
*   **Network Vulnerability Scanning:** Efficiently scan large network ranges.
*   **Shadow IT & Asset Discovery:** Uncover unmanaged and forgotten assets.
*   **CI/CD & Compliance Monitoring:** Integrate into pipelines for continuous security checks.

## Quick Start (Docker)

### CLI

```bash
# Basic port scan on a single IP address:
$ docker run owasp/nettacker -i 192.168.0.1 -m port_scan
# Scan the entire Class C network for any devices with port 22 open:
$ docker run owasp/nettacker -i 192.168.0.0/24 -m port_scan -g 22
# Scan all subdomains of 'owasp.org' for http/https services and return HTTP status code
$ docker run owasp/nettacker -i owasp.org -d -s -m http_status_scan
# Display Help
$ docker run owasp/nettacker --help
```

### Web UI

```bash
$ docker-compose up
```
* Use the API Key displayed in the CLI to login to the Web GUI
* Web GUI is accessible from your (https://localhost:5000) or https://nettacker-api.z3r0d4y.com:5000/ (pointed to your localhost)
* The local database is `.nettacker/data/nettacker.db` (sqlite).
* Default results path is `.nettacker/data/results`
* `docker-compose` will share your nettacker folder, so you will not lose any data after `docker-compose down`
* To see the API key in you can also run `docker logs nettacker_nettacker`.
* More details and install without docker https://nettacker.readthedocs.io/en/latest/Installation
