**DISCLAIMER: This software is designed for ethical and responsible use.  Always obtain permission before conducting any security assessments.**

## Key Features

*   **Modular Architecture:** Easily customize your scans with a modular design, allowing you to select specific tasks like port scanning, vulnerability checks, or credential brute-forcing.
*   **Multi-Protocol & Multithreaded Scanning:** Scan rapidly using multiple protocols (HTTP/HTTPS, FTP, SSH, SMB, SMTP, ICMP, TELNET, XML-RPC) and multithreading.
*   **Comprehensive Output:** Generate detailed reports in HTML, JSON, CSV, and plain text formats.
*   **Built-in Database & Drift Detection:** Track changes and identify new vulnerabilities with a built-in database that stores historical scan data.
*   **CLI, REST API & Web UI:** Choose your preferred interface: command-line, REST API for automation, or user-friendly web interface.
*   **Evasion Techniques:**  Use configurable delays, proxy support, and randomized user-agents to reduce detection.
*   **Flexible Target Support:**  Scan single IPs, IP ranges, CIDR blocks, domain names, and URLs.

## Use Cases

*   **Penetration Testing:** Automate reconnaissance, vulnerability assessments, and service discovery.
*   **Recon & Vulnerability Assessment:** Map hosts, ports, services, and perform brute-forcing with ease.
*   **Attack Surface Mapping:** Quickly discover exposed assets, subdomains, and services.
*   **Bug Bounty Recon:** Automate and scale common reconnaissance tasks.
*   **Network Vulnerability Scanning:** Perform efficient network assessments.
*   **Shadow IT & Asset Discovery:** Uncover unmanaged assets with historical data and drift detection.
*   **CI/CD & Compliance Monitoring:** Integrate Nettacker into pipelines to track infrastructure changes.

## Quick Start (Docker)

### CLI

```bash
# Basic port scan on a single IP address:
$ docker run owasp/nettacker -i 192.168.0.1 -m port_scan
# Scan the entire Class C network for any devices with port 22 open:
$ docker run owasp/nettacker -i 192.168.0.0/24 -m port_scan -g 22
# Scan all subdomains of 'owasp.org' for http/https services and return HTTP status code
$ docker run owasp/nettacker -i owasp.org -d -s -m http_status_scan
# Display Help
$ docker run owasp/nettacker --help
```

### Web UI

```bash
$ docker-compose up 
```

*   Access the Web GUI at `https://localhost:5000` or `https://nettacker-api.z3r0d4y.com:5000/`.
*   Use the API Key from the CLI output to log in.
*   Database is located at `.nettacker/data/nettacker.db` (SQLite).
*   Results are saved in `.nettacker/data/results`.
*   `docker-compose` shares your nettacker folder.
*   To see the API key, run `docker logs nettacker_nettacker`.
*   For more details and installation without docker, visit the [documentation](https://nettacker.readthedocs.io/en/latest/Installation).
