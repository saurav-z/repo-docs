## Key Features

*   **Modular Architecture:** Easily customize your scans with a modular design that lets you choose which tests to run, including port scanning, service detection, and credential brute-forcing.
*   **Multi-Protocol & Multithreaded Scanning:** Supports a wide range of protocols like HTTP/HTTPS, FTP, SSH, SMB, SMTP, and more, with parallel scanning for speed.
*   **Comprehensive Output:** Generate detailed reports in multiple formats (HTML, JSON, CSV, TXT) to share findings effectively.
*   **Built-in Database & Drift Detection:** Track scan history and identify changes in your infrastructure over time for improved security posture.
*   **CLI, REST API & Web UI:** Choose your preferred interface (command-line, API, or web-based) for maximum flexibility.
*   **Evasion Techniques:** Utilize proxy support, user-agent randomization, and delays to bypass detection mechanisms.
*   **Flexible Target Specification:** Scan individual IPs, ranges, CIDR blocks, domain names, and URLs, or import targets from a list.

## Use Cases

*   **Penetration Testing:** Automate reconnaissance, vulnerability assessments, and service discovery to streamline your penetration testing workflow.
*   **Recon & Vulnerability Assessment:** Identify live hosts, open ports, potential vulnerabilities, and default credentials.
*   **Attack Surface Mapping:** Quickly discover exposed assets, open ports, and subdomains for both internal and external assets.
*   **Bug Bounty Recon:** Automate common reconnaissance tasks to find bugs faster.
*   **Network Vulnerability Scanning:** Perform efficient network assessments across IPs, ranges, or entire CIDR blocks.
*   **Shadow IT & Asset Discovery:** Uncover unmanaged or forgotten hosts and services.
*   **CI/CD & Compliance Monitoring:** Integrate with your CI/CD pipeline to detect new vulnerabilities and track changes.

## Quick Start (Docker)

### CLI

```bash
# Basic port scan on a single IP address:
$ docker run owasp/nettacker -i 192.168.0.1 -m port_scan
# Scan the entire Class C network for any devices with port 22 open:
$ docker run owasp/nettacker -i 192.168.0.0/24 -m port_scan -g 22
# Scan all subdomains of 'owasp.org' for http/https services and return HTTP status code
$ docker run owasp/nettacker -i owasp.org -d -s -m http_status_scan
# Display Help
$ docker run owasp/nettacker --help
```

### Web UI

```bash
$ docker-compose up 
```

*   Access the Web GUI at `https://localhost:5000` (or the address provided by your docker setup).
*   Use the API Key displayed in the CLI output for login.
*   The local database is located at `.nettacker/data/nettacker.db` (sqlite).
*   Default results are saved in `.nettacker/data/results`.
*   Your nettacker folder is shared so your data won't be lost when using `docker-compose down`
*   View the API key by running `docker logs nettacker_nettacker`.
*   More details and install without docker: [Installation](https://nettacker.readthedocs.io/en/latest/Installation)
