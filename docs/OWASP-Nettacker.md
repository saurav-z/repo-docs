## Key Features

*   **Modular Architecture:** Perform specific tasks (port scanning, vulnerability checks, credential brute-forcing) through independent modules.
*   **Multi-Protocol Support:** Scan a wide range of protocols including HTTP/HTTPS, FTP, SSH, SMB, SMTP, ICMP, TELNET, and XML-RPC.
*   **Multithreaded Scanning:** Speed up assessments with parallel scanning capabilities.
*   **Comprehensive Reporting:** Generate reports in HTML, JSON, CSV, and plain text formats.
*   **Built-in Database & Drift Detection:** Track scan history and detect changes in infrastructure, ideal for CI/CD.
*   **Flexible Interface:** Utilize CLI, REST API, and a web UI for control and analysis.
*   **Evasion Techniques:** Employ configurable delays, proxy support, and user-agent randomization to evade detection.
*   **Target Flexibility:** Supports single IPs, IP ranges, CIDR blocks, domain names, and URLs.

## Use Cases

*   **Penetration Testing:** Automate reconnaissance, service discovery, and vulnerability scanning for efficient testing.
*   **Reconnaissance & Vulnerability Assessment:** Discover live hosts, open ports, services, and vulnerabilities.
*   **Attack Surface Mapping:** Quickly identify exposed assets, services, and subdomains.
*   **Bug Bounty Recon:** Automate subdomain enumeration, directory brute-forcing, and credential checks.
*   **Network Vulnerability Scanning:** Efficiently scan networks and detect vulnerabilities.
*   **Shadow IT & Asset Discovery:** Uncover unmanaged assets using historical scan data.
*   **CI/CD & Compliance Monitoring:** Integrate Nettacker into pipelines to track infrastructure changes and vulnerabilities.

## Quick Setup & Run (Docker)

### CLI

```bash
# Basic port scan on a single IP address:
docker run owasp/nettacker -i 192.168.0.1 -m port_scan
# Scan the entire Class C network for any devices with port 22 open:
docker run owasp/nettacker -i 192.168.0.0/24 -m port_scan -g 22
# Scan all subdomains of 'owasp.org' for http/https services and return HTTP status code
docker run owasp/nettacker -i owasp.org -d -s -m http_status_scan
# Display Help
docker run owasp/nettacker --help
```

### Web UI

```bash
docker-compose up
```

*   Access the Web GUI at https://localhost:5000.
*   Login using the API Key displayed in the CLI.
*   The local database is `.nettacker/data/nettacker.db` (sqlite).
*   Default results path is `.nettacker/data/results`
*   `docker-compose` shares your nettacker folder, so you won't lose data after `docker-compose down`.
*   To view the API key, run `docker logs nettacker_nettacker`.
*   For more installation details without Docker: [Installation](https://nettacker.readthedocs.io/en/latest/Installation)
