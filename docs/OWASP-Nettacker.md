## Key Features

*   **Modular Architecture:** Perform tasks like port scanning, directory discovery, and credential brute-forcing using individual modules, giving you control over each step of your assessment.
*   **Multi-Protocol & Multithreaded Scanning:** Supports HTTP/HTTPS, FTP, SSH, SMB, SMTP, ICMP, TELNET, XML-RPC, and more, with parallel scanning for faster results.
*   **Comprehensive Output:** Export reports in various formats, including HTML, JSON, CSV, and plain text.
*   **Built-in Database & Drift Detection:** Store scan data for easy comparison and identification of changes, such as new hosts or vulnerabilities.
*   **CLI, REST API & Web UI:** Integrate Nettacker into your workflow using CLI, REST API, or the user-friendly web interface.
*   **Evasion Techniques:** Utilize configurable delays, proxy support, and randomized user-agents to avoid detection.
*   **Flexible Target Input:** Scan single IPs, IP ranges, CIDR blocks, domain names, and URLs, with the option to load targets from a file.

## Use Cases

*   **Penetration Testing:** Automate reconnaissance, misconfiguration checks, service discovery, and vulnerability scanning to streamline your testing.
*   **Reconnaissance & Vulnerability Assessment:** Map live hosts, identify open ports, and perform credential brute-forcing or fuzzing.
*   **Attack Surface Mapping:** Discover exposed hosts, ports, subdomains, and services for both internal and external assets.
*   **Bug Bounty Reconnaissance:** Automate subdomain enumeration, directory brute-forcing, and default credential checks.
*   **Network Vulnerability Scanning:** Efficiently scan IPs, IP ranges, or entire CIDR blocks.
*   **Shadow IT & Asset Discovery:** Identify unmanaged hosts, services, and subdomains.
*   **CI/CD & Compliance Monitoring:** Track infrastructure changes and detect new vulnerabilities.

## Getting Started

### CLI (Docker)

```bash
# Basic port scan on a single IP address:
$ docker run owasp/nettacker -i 192.168.0.1 -m port_scan
# Scan the entire Class C network for any devices with port 22 open:
$ docker run owasp/nettacker -i 192.168.0.0/24 -m port_scan -g 22
# Scan all subdomains of 'owasp.org' for http/https services and return HTTP status code
$ docker run owasp/nettacker -i owasp.org -d -s -m http_status_scan
# Display Help
$ docker run owasp/nettacker --help
```

### Web UI (Docker)

```bash
$ docker-compose up
```

*   Use the API Key displayed in the CLI to login to the Web GUI
*   Web GUI is accessible from your (https://localhost:5000) or https://nettacker-api.z3r0d4y.com:5000/ (pointed to your localhost)
*   The local database is `.nettacker/data/nettacker.db` (sqlite).
*   Default results path is `.nettacker/data/results`
*   `docker-compose` will share your nettacker folder, so you will not lose any data after `docker-compose down`
*   To see the API key in you can also run `docker logs nettacker_nettacker`.
*   More details and install without docker [here](https://nettacker.readthedocs.io/en/latest/Installation).
