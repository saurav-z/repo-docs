## Key Features

*   **Modular Architecture:** Execute specific tasks independently, providing granular control over your scans.
*   **Multi-Protocol & Multithreaded Scanning:**  Supports HTTP/HTTPS, FTP, SSH, SMB, SMTP, ICMP, TELNET, XML-RPC and more, with parallel scanning capabilities for speed.
*   **Comprehensive Reporting:** Export results in HTML, JSON, CSV, and plain text formats.
*   **Built-in Database & Drift Detection:**  Store scan data for historical analysis and identify changes.
*   **CLI, REST API & Web UI:**  Choose your preferred interface for managing and viewing scan results.
*   **Evasion Techniques:**  Utilize proxy support, configurable delays, and randomized user-agents to minimize detection.
*   **Flexible Target Input:**  Accept single IPs, IP ranges, CIDR blocks, domains, and URLs, or load targets from a file.

## Use Cases

*   **Penetration Testing:** Automate reconnaissance, vulnerability assessments, and service discovery.
*   **Reconnaissance & Vulnerability Assessment:** Map live hosts, open ports, services, and directories, and perform brute-force testing.
*   **Attack Surface Mapping:** Quickly discover exposed hosts, ports, subdomains, and services.
*   **Bug Bounty Recon:** Automate subdomain enumeration, directory brute-forcing, and credential checks.
*   **Network Vulnerability Scanning:**  Assess IPs, IP ranges, CIDR blocks, or subdomains using a modular approach.
*   **Shadow IT & Asset Discovery:** Uncover unmanaged assets using historical data and drift detection.
*   **CI/CD & Compliance Monitoring:** Integrate Nettacker to track infrastructure changes and detect new vulnerabilities.

## Quick Start (Docker)

### CLI

```bash
# Basic port scan on a single IP address:
$ docker run owasp/nettacker -i 192.168.0.1 -m port_scan
# Scan the entire Class C network for any devices with port 22 open:
$ docker run owasp/nettacker -i 192.168.0.0/24 -m port_scan -g 22
# Scan all subdomains of 'owasp.org' for http/https services and return HTTP status code
$ docker run owasp/nettacker -i owasp.org -d -s -m http_status_scan
# Display Help
$ docker run owasp/nettacker --help
```

### Web UI

```bash
$ docker-compose up 
```

*   Use the API Key displayed in the CLI to log in to the Web GUI.
*   Web GUI accessible from your (https://localhost:5000) or https://nettacker-api.z3r0d4y.com:5000/ (pointed to your localhost)
*   The local database is `.nettacker/data/nettacker.db` (sqlite).
*   Default results path is `.nettacker/data/results`
*   `docker-compose` will share your nettacker folder, so you will not lose any data after `docker-compose down`
*   To see the API key in you can also run `docker logs nettacker_nettacker`.
*   More details and install without docker https://nettacker.readthedocs.io/en/latest/Installation
