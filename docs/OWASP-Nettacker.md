*   **CLI, REST API & Web UI:**  Access the framework via command-line interface, REST API for integration, and a user-friendly web interface.
*   **Evasion Techniques:** Utilize delays, proxy support, and randomized user-agents to avoid detection.
*   **Flexible Target Input:** Scan single IPs, IP ranges, CIDR blocks, domain names, or URLs.

## **Use Cases:**

*   **Penetration Testing:** Automate reconnaissance and vulnerability scanning.
*   **Reconnaissance & Vulnerability Assessment:** Discover hosts, ports, services, and vulnerabilities.
*   **Attack Surface Mapping:** Quickly identify exposed assets.
*   **Bug Bounty Recon:** Automate reconnaissance tasks.
*   **Network Vulnerability Scanning:** Perform efficient assessments of networks.

## Quick Start with Docker

### CLI

```bash
# Basic port scan on a single IP address:
$ docker run owasp/nettacker -i 192.168.0.1 -m port_scan
# Scan the entire Class C network for any devices with port 22 open:
$ docker run owasp/nettacker -i 192.168.0.0/24 -m port_scan -g 22
# Scan all subdomains of 'owasp.org' for http/https services and return HTTP status code
$ docker run owasp/nettacker -i owasp.org -d -s -m http_status_scan
# Display Help
$ docker run owasp/nettacker --help
```

### Web UI

```bash
$ docker-compose up 
```
* Use the API Key displayed in the CLI to login to the Web GUI
* Web GUI is accessible from your (https://localhost:5000) or https://nettacker-api.z3r0d4y.com:5000/ (pointed to your localhost)
* The local database is `.nettacker/data/nettacker.db` (sqlite).
* Default results path is `.nettacker/data/results`
* `docker-compose` will share your nettacker folder, so you will not lose any data after `docker-compose down`
* To see the API key in you can also run `docker logs nettacker_nettacker`.
* More details and install without docker https://nettacker.readthedocs.io/en/latest/Installation
