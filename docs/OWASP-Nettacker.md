## Key Features of OWASP Nettacker

*   **Modular Architecture:** Utilize independent modules for various tasks like port scanning, vulnerability checks, and more, providing granular control over your scans.
*   **Multi-Protocol Support:** Scan a wide range of protocols, including HTTP/HTTPS, FTP, SSH, SMB, SMTP, and more.
*   **Multithreaded Scanning:** Achieve faster results with parallel scanning capabilities.
*   **Comprehensive Reporting:** Generate detailed reports in multiple formats, including HTML, JSON, CSV, and plain text.
*   **Database Integration:** Store scan results in a database for easy tracking and comparison.
*   **CLI, REST API & Web UI:** Choose your preferred interface ‚Äì command-line, REST API, or a user-friendly web UI.
*   **Evasion Techniques:** Implement delays, proxy support, and user-agent randomization to bypass detection.
*   **Flexible Target Input:** Specify targets using single IPs, IP ranges, CIDR blocks, domain names, or URLs.

## Use Cases

*   **Penetration Testing:** Automate reconnaissance, vulnerability scanning, and exploit attempts.
*   **Reconnaissance & Vulnerability Assessment:** Discover live hosts, open ports, services, default credentials, and directories.
*   **Attack Surface Mapping:** Quickly identify exposed assets and services.
*   **Bug Bounty Recon:** Automate subdomain enumeration and credential checks.
*   **Network Vulnerability Scanning:** Conduct efficient assessments of networks.
*   **Shadow IT & Asset Discovery:** Uncover forgotten or unmanaged assets.
*   **CI/CD & Compliance Monitoring:** Integrate Nettacker into your pipelines to track changes and vulnerabilities.

## Getting Started

### CLI (Docker)

```bash
# Basic port scan on a single IP address:
$ docker run owasp/nettacker -i 192.168.0.1 -m port_scan
# Scan the entire Class C network for any devices with port 22 open:
$ docker run owasp/nettacker -i 192.168.0.0/24 -m port_scan -g 22
# Scan all subdomains of 'owasp.org' for http/https services and return HTTP status code
$ docker run owasp/nettacker -i owasp.org -d -s -m http_status_scan
# Display Help
$ docker run owasp/nettacker --help
```

### Web UI (Docker)

```bash
$ docker-compose up 
```

*   Access the Web GUI using the API Key displayed in the CLI.
*   Web GUI is accessible from your (https://localhost:5000) or https://nettacker-api.z3r0d4y.com:5000/ (pointed to your localhost)
*   The local database is `.nettacker/data/nettacker.db` (sqlite).
*   Default results path is `.nettacker/data/results`
*   `docker-compose` will share your nettacker folder, so you will not lose any data after `docker-compose down`
*   To see the API key in you can also run `docker logs nettacker_nettacker`.
*   More details and install without docker https://nettacker.readthedocs.io/en/latest/Installation
