## Key Features

*   **Modular Architecture:** Execute specific tasks like port scanning, vulnerability checks, and credential brute-forcing via modular components, allowing for highly-customized scans.
*   **Multi-Protocol & Multithreaded Scanning:**  Supports HTTP/HTTPS, FTP, SSH, SMB, SMTP, ICMP, TELNET, and XML-RPC, with parallel scanning capabilities for increased speed.
*   **Comprehensive Reporting:**  Generate reports in HTML, JSON, CSV, and plain text formats to easily analyze and share results.
*   **Built-in Database & Drift Detection:** Store scan results in a database for historical analysis, comparison, and detecting changes in the target environment.
*   **CLI, REST API & Web UI:** Offers a flexible choice of command-line, REST API, and user-friendly web interfaces for seamless integration into different workflows.
*   **Evasion Techniques:** Utilize configurable delays, proxy support, and randomized user-agents to help avoid detection by security systems.
*   **Flexible Target Input:**  Accepts single IPv4s, IP ranges, CIDR blocks, domain names, and full HTTP/HTTPS URLs.
*   **Docker Support:** Easy deployment using Docker, allowing for a simple setup to get you started.

## Use Cases

*   **Penetration Testing:** Automate reconnaissance, misconfiguration checks, service discovery, and vulnerability scanning.
*   **Recon & Vulnerability Assessment:** Map hosts, identify open ports, services, default credentials, and directories, then use brute-force attacks or fuzzing.
*   **Attack Surface Mapping:** Quickly discover exposed hosts, ports, subdomains, and services.
*   **Bug Bounty Recon:** Automate and scale subdomain enumeration, directory brute-forcing, and default credential checks.
*   **Network Vulnerability Scanning:** Scan IPs, IP ranges, CIDR blocks, or subdomains efficiently.
*   **Shadow IT & Asset Discovery:** Uncover unmanaged hosts, open ports/services, and subdomains.
*   **CI/CD & Compliance Monitoring:** Integrate Nettacker to detect infrastructure changes and new vulnerabilities.

## Quick Start with Docker

### CLI (Docker)

```bash
# Basic port scan on a single IP address:
$ docker run owasp/nettacker -i 192.168.0.1 -m port_scan
# Scan the entire Class C network for any devices with port 22 open:
$ docker run owasp/nettacker -i 192.168.0.0/24 -m port_scan -g 22
# Scan all subdomains of 'owasp.org' for http/https services and return HTTP status code
$ docker run owasp/nettacker -i owasp.org -d -s -m http_status_scan
# Display Help
$ docker run owasp/nettacker --help
```

### Web UI (Docker)

```bash
$ docker-compose up 
```
*   Use the API Key displayed in the CLI to login to the Web GUI
*   Web GUI is accessible from your (https://localhost:5000) or https://nettacker-api.z3r0d4y.com:5000/ (pointed to your localhost)
*   The local database is `.nettacker/data/nettacker.db` (sqlite).
*   Default results path is `.nettacker/data/results`
*   `docker-compose` will share your nettacker folder, so you will not lose any data after `docker-compose down`
*   To see the API key in you can also run `docker logs nettacker_nettacker`.
*   More details and install without docker https://nettacker.readthedocs.io/en/latest/Installation
