## Key Features

*   **Modular Architecture:** Easily customize your scans with modules for port scanning, vulnerability checks, and more.
*   **Multi-Protocol & Multithreaded Scanning:** Supports HTTP/HTTPS, FTP, SSH, and other protocols, with parallel scanning for speed.
*   **Comprehensive Output:** Generate reports in HTML, JSON, CSV, and plain text formats.
*   **Built-in Database & Drift Detection:** Track scan history and detect changes in your infrastructure.
*   **CLI, REST API & Web UI:** Offers multiple interfaces for flexibility and ease of use.
*   **Evasion Techniques:** Utilize proxies, delays, and randomized user agents to avoid detection.
*   **Flexible Targeting:** Target single IPs, ranges, CIDR blocks, domains, and URLs.

## Use Cases

*   **Penetration Testing:** Streamline reconnaissance, service discovery, and vulnerability assessments.
*   **Recon & Vulnerability Assessment:** Map hosts, ports, and services, and perform credential brute-forcing.
*   **Attack Surface Mapping:** Quickly identify exposed hosts, ports, and services for internal and external assets.
*   **Bug Bounty Recon:** Automate common reconnaissance tasks to find targets quickly.
*   **Network Vulnerability Scanning:** Efficiently scan large networks and subdomains.
*   **Shadow IT & Asset Discovery:** Uncover unmanaged or forgotten assets.
*   **CI/CD & Compliance Monitoring:** Track infrastructure changes and detect new vulnerabilities.

## Quick Start with Docker

**CLI:**

```bash
# Basic port scan
docker run owasp/nettacker -i 192.168.0.1 -m port_scan

# Scan a network for open port 22
docker run owasp/nettacker -i 192.168.0.0/24 -m port_scan -g 22

# Scan subdomain for http/https
docker run owasp/nettacker -i owasp.org -d -s -m http_status_scan

# See all the options
docker run owasp/nettacker --help
```

**Web UI:**

```bash
docker-compose up 
```

*   Access the Web GUI at `https://localhost:5000` (or your Docker host's IP).
*   Use the API Key displayed in the CLI to login.
*   Data is stored in the local database: `.nettacker/data/nettacker.db` (sqlite).
*   Results are saved in `.nettacker/data/results`.
