# ContestTrade: AI-Powered Multi-Agent Trading Framework

**ContestTrade** is a cutting-edge multi-agent trading framework that leverages AI to automatically identify and capitalize on event-driven investment opportunities, offering a powerful solution for building your own AI trading team.  [Explore the original repo on GitHub](https://github.com/FinStep-AI/ContestTrade)

## Key Features

*   **Automated Stock Selection:**  Scans the entire market and generates tradable stock lists without manual screening.
*   **Event-Driven Focus:**  Identifies opportunities triggered by catalysts like news, announcements, and policy changes.
*   **Customizable Agents:** Supports user-defined research preferences and strategies for flexible adaptation.
*   **Multi-Stage Contest Mechanism:** Employs a two-stage pipeline to ensure robust and reliable investment insights.
*   **Market Coverage:** Supports both US and other markets.

## Introduction

ContestTrade is a multi-agent trading framework designed for event-driven stock selection, aiming to autonomously discover, evaluate, and track valuable investment opportunities. It provides executable asset allocation recommendations without human intervention.

## Framework Overview

ContestTrade's workflow mirrors an investment firm's decision-making process through a structured two-stage pipeline:

1.  **Data Processing Stage:** The **Data Team** receives market data from various sources. Data Analysis Agents transform raw data into structured "textual factors," evaluated through an internal contest to build an optimal "factor portfolio."
2.  **Research and Decision-Making Stage:**  The **Research Team** receives the optimal factor portfolio. Research Agents, each with their "Trading Beliefs" and financial tools, conduct in-depth analyses and submit trading proposals. Another internal contest synthesizes these proposals into a unified asset allocation strategy.

## Preference Configuration

Customize Research Agent "trading beliefs" in the `contest_trade/config/belief_list.json` file.  Each agent can generate up to 5 signals.

**Example 1: Short-Term Event-Driven (Aggressive)**

```json
[
  "Focus on short-term event-driven opportunities: prioritize company announcements, M&A and restructuring, sudden order increases, technological breakthroughs and other catalysts; prefer mid/small-cap, high-volatility thematic stocks, suitable for aggressive arbitrage strategies."
]
```

**Example 2: Stable Events (Conservative)**

```json
[
  "Focus on stable, high-certainty events: pay attention to dividends, buybacks, earnings forecast confirmations, major contract signings and policy tailwinds; prefer large-cap blue-chips with low volatility and high certainty, suitable for conservative allocation."
]
```

**Default Configuration:**

```json
[
  "Based on the provided information, comprehensively consider each company's business dynamics, industry trends and potential market impact. Recommend stock portfolios with short-term investment potential for two groups: Group 1 â€” risk-seekers (prefer high volatility, high returns, mid/low market cap stocks); Group 2 â€” conservative investors (prefer low volatility, stable returns, large-cap stocks).",
  "Based on recent sudden events, policy adjustments and company announcements as catalysts, combined with market sentiment transmission paths and capital game features. Screen event-driven opportunities for two different styles: Group 1 â€” aggressive arbitrage (prefer restructuring expectation, sudden order increases, technical breakthroughs in small-cap stocks); Group 2 â€” defensive arbitrage (prefer dividend increases, large buybacks, acquisition of franchise rights in blue-chip stocks). Pay attention to northbound capital movement and institutional seat trends on the trading leaderboard for resonance effects."
]
```

## Usage

Run ContestTrade using the Command Line Interface (CLI):

```bash
python -m cli.main run
