# ContestTrade: Revolutionizing AI-Driven Trading

**ContestTrade is a cutting-edge, multi-agent trading framework designed to autonomously identify and capitalize on event-driven investment opportunities.**  For the original source code, please visit the [ContestTrade GitHub Repository](https://github.com/FinStep-AI/ContestTrade).

## Key Features

*   **Automated Stock Selection:** Scans the entire market to generate tradable stock lists, eliminating manual screening.
*   **Event-Driven Strategy:** Focuses on opportunities triggered by catalysts like news, announcements, and policy changes.
*   **Personalized Configuration:** Enables user-defined agent research preferences and strategies, adapting to various investment styles.
*   **Multi-Agent Architecture:**  Employs a two-stage pipeline with data and research teams to simulate investment firm decision-making.
*   **Open-Source & Community Driven:** Encourages contributions for infrastructure, agent variety, and financial trading exploration.

## Introduction

ContestTrade is a sophisticated, multi-agent trading framework engineered for event-driven stock selection. It's designed to automatically discover, evaluate, and track investment opportunities without human intervention, ultimately providing actionable asset allocation recommendations.

## Framework Overview

<p align="center">
  <img src="assets/architecture.jpg" style="width: 90%; height: auto;">
</p>

The ContestTrade framework operates through a two-stage pipeline, mirroring the investment decision-making process of a financial firm.

1.  **Data Processing Stage:** Raw market data is processed by the **Data Team**, consisting of Data Analysis Agents that convert data into "textual factors." An internal contest mechanism evaluates these factors to construct an optimal "factor portfolio."

2.  **Research and Decision-Making Stage:** The factor portfolio is passed to the **Research Team**, comprising Research Agents with unique "Trading Beliefs." These agents conduct in-depth analysis and submit trading proposals. A second internal contest then synthesizes these proposals into a unified asset allocation strategy.

## Installation

Follow these steps to install and set up ContestTrade:

```bash
# 1. Clone the project repository
git clone https://github.com/FinStep-AI/ContestTrade.git
cd ContestTrade

# 2. (Recommended) Create and activate a virtual environment
conda create -n contesttrade python=3.10
conda activate contesttrade

# 3. Install project dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Or, deploy with [Docker](https://docs.n8n.io/hosting/installation/docker/):

```
docker run -it --rm --name contest_trade -v $(pwd)/config.yaml:/ContestTrade/config.yaml finstep/contesttrade:v1.1
```

> **Note:**  You will need to obtain your own LLM and VLM API keys and populate the corresponding URLs, API keys, and model names.

## Preference Configuration

Each Research Agent operates according to a defined "trading belief."  These beliefs guide the system's generation of investment signals, based on data and tools (each belief yields up to 5 signals). The configuration file, located at `contest_trade/config/belief_list.json`, uses a JSON array of strings.

**Example Preferences:**

*   **Short-term event-driven (Aggressive):**
    ```json
    [
      "Focus on short-term event-driven opportunities: prioritize company announcements, M&A and restructuring, sudden order increases, technological breakthroughs and other catalysts; prefer mid/small-cap, high-volatility thematic stocks, suitable for aggressive arbitrage strategies."
    ]
    ```

*   **Stable events (Conservative):**
    ```json
    [
      "Focus on stable, high-certainty events: pay attention to dividends, buybacks, earnings forecast confirmations, major contract signings and policy tailwinds; prefer large-cap blue-chips with low volatility and high certainty, suitable for conservative allocation."
    ]
    ```

**Default Configuration:**

```json
[
  "Based on the provided information, comprehensively consider each company's business dynamics, industry trends and potential market impact. Recommend stock portfolios with short-term investment potential for two groups: Group 1 â€” risk-seekers (prefer high volatility, high returns, mid/low market cap stocks); Group 2 â€” conservative investors (prefer low volatility, stable returns, large-cap stocks).",
  "Based on recent sudden events, policy adjustments and company announcements as catalysts, combined with market sentiment transmission paths and capital game features. Screen event-driven opportunities for two different styles: Group 1 â€” aggressive arbitrage (prefer restructuring expectation, sudden order increases, technical breakthroughs in small-cap stocks); Group 2 â€” defensive arbitrage (prefer dividend increases, large buybacks, acquisition of franchise rights in blue-chip stocks). Pay attention to northbound capital movement and institutional seat trends on the trading leaderboard for resonance effects."
]
```

## Usage
