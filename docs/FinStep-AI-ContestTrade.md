# ContestTrade: AI-Powered Multi-Agent Trading Framework

**ContestTrade** is a cutting-edge, open-source multi-agent trading framework designed to build autonomous AI trading teams for event-driven investment strategies.

## Key Features

*   **Automated Stock Selection:**  Scans the entire market to automatically identify and generate tradable stock lists, eliminating manual screening.
*   **Event-Driven Strategy:** Focuses on opportunities triggered by catalysts like news, announcements, capital flows, and policy changes, capitalizing on significant information impact.
*   **Personalized Configuration:** Offers flexible customization with user-defined agent research preferences and strategies to suit diverse investment styles.
*   **Multi-Agent Architecture:** Employs a two-stage contest mechanism to refine data and strategies, ensuring robust and effective trading signals.
*   **Multi-Market Support:** Supports the US stock market and plans for expansion to include other markets (e.g., Hong Kong).

## Introduction

ContestTrade is an innovative multi-agent (Multi-Agent) trading framework, specifically designed for event-driven stock selection. The system automatically discovers, evaluates, and tracks event-driven opportunities with investment potential, delivering executable asset allocation recommendations without human intervention.

## Framework Overview

<p align="center">
  <img src="assets/architecture.jpg" style="width: 90%; height: auto;">
</p>

The ContestTrade workflow operates through a two-stage pipeline, mimicking the dynamic decision-making process of an investment firm. This dual-contest framework ensures decisions are based on the most reliable insights, maintaining adaptability and resilience in complex markets:

1.  **Data Processing Stage:**  Raw market data from multiple sources is processed by the **Data Team**, where multiple Data Analysis Agents convert data into structured "textual factors".  An internal contest mechanism evaluates these factors to construct an optimal "factor portfolio."
2.  **Research and Decision-Making Stage:** The factor portfolio is then passed to the **Research Team**. Research Agents, each with unique "Trading Beliefs" and access to financial tools, analyze the factors and submit trading proposals. A second contest evaluates these proposals, synthesizing a unified asset allocation strategy.

## Installation

Get started with ContestTrade by following these steps:

```bash
# 1. Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/FinStep-AI/ContestTrade.git
cd ContestTrade

# 2. Create and activate a virtual environment (recommended)
conda create -n contesttrade python=3.10
conda activate contesttrade

# 3. Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Alternatively, deploy with Docker:

```bash
docker run -it --rm --name contest_trade -v $(pwd)/config.yaml:/ContestTrade/config.yaml finstep/contesttrade:v2.0
```

## Preference Customization

Customize Research Agents by modifying their "trading beliefs" in `contest_trade/config/belief_list.json`.  Each agent's belief generates up to five signals.

**Example 1: Short-Term Event-Driven (Aggressive)**

```json
[
  "Focus on short-term event-driven opportunities: prioritize company announcements, M&A and restructuring, sudden order increases, technological breakthroughs and other catalysts; prefer mid/small-cap, high-volatility thematic stocks, suitable for aggressive arbitrage strategies."
]
```

**Example 2: Stable Events (Conservative)**

```json
[
  "Focus on stable, high-certainty events: pay attention to dividends, buybacks, earnings forecast confirmations, major contract signings and policy tailwinds; prefer large-cap blue-chips with low volatility and high certainty, suitable for conservative allocation."
]
```

**Default Configuration:**

```json
[
  "Based on the provided information, comprehensively consider each company's business dynamics, industry trends and potential market impact. Recommend stock portfolios with short-term investment potential for two groups: Group 1 â€” risk-seekers (prefer high volatility, high returns, mid/low market cap stocks); Group 2 â€” conservative investors (prefer low volatility, stable returns, large-cap stocks).",
  "Based on recent sudden events, policy adjustments and company announcements as catalysts, combined with market sentiment transmission paths and capital game features. Screen event-driven opportunities for two different styles: Group 1 â€” aggressive arbitrage (prefer restructuring expectation, sudden order increases, technical breakthroughs in small-cap stocks); Group 2 â€” defensive arbitrage (prefer dividend increases, large buybacks, acquisition of franchise rights in blue-chip stocks). Pay attention to northbound capital movement and institutional seat trends on the trading leaderboard for resonance effects."
]
```
