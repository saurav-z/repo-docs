# ContestTrade: An AI-Powered Multi-Agent Trading System

**ContestTrade** is a cutting-edge multi-agent trading framework that harnesses the power of AI to autonomously identify and capitalize on event-driven investment opportunities, providing data-driven insights without human intervention.  [Explore the original repo on GitHub!](https://github.com/FinStep-AI/ContestTrade)

## Key Features

*   **Automated Stock Selection:** Scans the entire market and generates tradable stock lists automatically.
*   **Event-Driven Strategy:** Focuses on opportunities triggered by catalysts like news, announcements, and policy changes.
*   **Multi-Agent Architecture:** Employs a two-stage pipeline with data and research teams for robust decision-making.
*   **Personalized Configuration:** Supports user-defined preferences and strategies to adapt to various investment styles.

## Introduction

ContestTrade is designed to automatically discover, evaluate, and track event-driven opportunities, generating actionable asset allocation recommendations. It utilizes a multi-agent system to simulate the decision-making process of an investment firm. This framework allows for automated market analysis and strategic investment choices.

## Framework Overview

The ContestTrade workflow operates in two main stages:

1.  **Data Processing Stage:**  Raw market data from various sources is processed by the **Data Team**, which comprises multiple Data Analysis Agents.  These agents refine the raw data into structured "textual factors," and an internal contest mechanism identifies the most valuable factors.

2.  **Research and Decision-Making Stage:**  The optimal factor portfolio from the Data Team is then passed to the **Research Team**. Multiple Research Agents, each with unique "Trading Beliefs" and access to financial tools, conduct in-depth analyses.  A second internal contest evaluates these proposals, resulting in a consolidated asset allocation strategy.

## Preference Settings

Customize the trading behavior of each Research Agent through "trading beliefs," defined in the `contest_trade/config/belief_list.json` file.

*Example preferences for short-term event-driven strategies:*

```json
[
  "Focus on short-term event-driven opportunities: prioritize company announcements, M&A and restructuring, sudden order increases, technological breakthroughs and other catalysts; prefer mid/small-cap, high-volatility thematic stocks, suitable for aggressive arbitrage strategies."
]
```

*Example preferences for stable events:*

```json
[
  "Focus on stable, high-certainty events: pay attention to dividends, buybacks, earnings forecast confirmations, major contract signings and policy tailwinds; prefer large-cap blue-chips with low volatility and high certainty, suitable for conservative allocation."
]
```

*Default configuration:*

```json
[
  "Based on the provided information, comprehensively consider each company's business dynamics, industry trends and potential market impact. Recommend stock portfolios with short-term investment potential for two groups: Group 1 â€” risk-seekers (prefer high volatility, high returns, mid/low market cap stocks); Group 2 â€” conservative investors (prefer low volatility, stable returns, large-cap stocks).",
  "Based on recent sudden events, policy adjustments and company announcements as catalysts, combined with market sentiment transmission paths and capital game features. Screen event-driven opportunities for two different styles: Group 1 â€” aggressive arbitrage (prefer restructuring expectation, sudden order increases, technical breakthroughs in small-cap stocks); Group 2 â€” defensive arbitrage (prefer dividend increases, large buybacks, acquisition of franchise rights in blue-chip stocks). Pay attention to northbound capital movement and institutional seat trends on the trading leaderboard for resonance effects."
]
