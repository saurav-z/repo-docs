# ContestTrade: AI-Powered Multi-Agent Trading Framework

**Unleash the power of AI in your trading strategy with ContestTrade, an innovative multi-agent framework designed to automate event-driven stock selection.** [Explore the original repository](https://github.com/FinStep-AI/ContestTrade)

## Key Features

*   **Automated Stock Selection:** Scan the entire market and generate tradable stock lists automatically, eliminating manual screening.
*   **Event-Driven Analysis:** Focus on opportunities triggered by news, announcements, capital flows, and policy changes.
*   **Customizable Configuration:** Tailor agent research preferences and strategies to align with diverse investment styles.
*   **Multi-Agent Architecture:** Simulate a dynamic investment firm with data processing and research teams working in parallel, with an internal contest mechanism.
*   **Multi-Market Support:** Access US stock market data.

## Introduction

ContestTrade is a multi-agent trading framework meticulously designed for event-driven stock selection. Its primary objective is to autonomously identify, evaluate, and track event-driven investment opportunities, ultimately delivering actionable asset allocation recommendations without human intervention. The system's architecture simulates the workflows of an investment firm, fostering adaptability and resilience in complex market environments.

## Framework Overview

<p align="center">
  <img src="assets/architecture.jpg" style="width: 90%; height: auto;">
</p>

ContestTrade operates through a structured two-stage pipeline, mirroring the decision-making processes of an investment firm. This dual-contest framework ensures that final decisions are driven by the most robust and effective insights.

1.  **Data Processing Stage:** Raw market data is processed by the **Data Team**. Multiple Data Analysis Agents transform raw data into structured "textual factors". An internal contest mechanism evaluates the potential value of each factor, creating an optimal "factor portfolio."

2.  **Research and Decision-Making Stage:** The factor portfolio is passed to the **Research Team**. Research Agents, each with unique "Trading Beliefs" and access to financial tools, conduct in-depth analyses and propose trading strategies. A second contest evaluates the proposals, culminating in a unified asset allocation strategy.

## Installation

1.  **Clone the Repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/FinStep-AI/ContestTrade.git
    cd ContestTrade
    ```

2.  **(Recommended) Create and Activate a Virtual Environment:**
    ```bash
    conda create -n contesttrade python=3.10
    conda activate contesttrade
    ```

3.  **Install Dependencies:**
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

**Alternative Installation with Docker:**

## Preference Configuration

Customize Research Agent behavior using "trading beliefs" in `contest_trade/config/belief_list.json`.

*   **Example 1 (Aggressive):**
    ```json
    [
      "Focus on short-term event-driven opportunities: prioritize company announcements, M&A and restructuring, sudden order increases, technological breakthroughs and other catalysts; prefer mid/small-cap, high-volatility thematic stocks, suitable for aggressive arbitrage strategies."
    ]
    ```

*   **Example 2 (Conservative):**
    ```json
    [
      "Focus on stable, high-certainty events: pay attention to dividends, buybacks, earnings forecast confirmations, major contract signings and policy tailwinds; prefer large-cap blue-chips with low volatility and high certainty, suitable for conservative allocation."
    ]
    ```

*   **Default Configuration:**
    ```json
    [
      "Based on the provided information, comprehensively consider each company's business dynamics, industry trends and potential market impact. Recommend stock portfolios with short-term investment potential for two groups: Group 1 â€” risk-seekers (prefer high volatility, high returns, mid/low market cap stocks); Group 2 â€” conservative investors (prefer low volatility, stable returns, large-cap stocks).",
      "Based on recent sudden events, policy adjustments and company announcements as catalysts, combined with market sentiment transmission paths and capital game features. Screen event-driven opportunities for two different styles: Group 1 â€” aggressive arbitrage (prefer restructuring expectation, sudden order increases, technical breakthroughs in small-cap stocks); Group 2 â€” defensive arbitrage (prefer dividend increases, large buybacks, acquisition of franchise rights in blue-chip stocks). Pay attention to northbound capital movement and institutional seat trends on the trading leaderboard for resonance effects."
    ]
    ```

## Usage

Run ContestTrade using the Command Line Interface (CLI):

```bash
python -m cli.main run
```

The CLI allows interactive market selection and provides results summaries, detailed research reports, and data analysis reports in the `contest_trade/agents_workspace/results` directory.
