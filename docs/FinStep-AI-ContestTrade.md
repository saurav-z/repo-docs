## Key Features

*   **Autonomous Stock Selection:** Automatically scans the entire market to generate tradable stock lists, eliminating the need for manual screening.
*   **Event-Driven Strategy:** Focuses on investment opportunities triggered by catalysts such as news, announcements, capital flows, and policy changes.
*   **Customizable Configuration:** Supports user-defined agent research preferences and strategies to adapt to diverse investment styles.
*   **Multi-Agent Framework:** Employs a dual-contest framework to refine decisions based on robust insights.
*   **Multi-Market Support:** Including support for US stock market data.

## Framework Overview

ContestTrade operates through a two-stage pipeline, mirroring the decision-making process of an investment firm.

1.  **Data Processing Stage:** The **Data Team** processes raw market data from multiple sources. Multiple Data Analysis Agents work in parallel to refine this raw data into structured "textual factors." An internal contest mechanism then constructs an optimal "factor portfolio."

2.  **Research and Decision-Making Stage:** The optimal factor portfolio is passed to the **Research Team**. Multiple Research Agents, each with unique "Trading Beliefs," conduct parallel analyses and submit trading proposals. A second internal contest synthesizes a reliable asset allocation strategy.

## Preference - Trading Belief Configuration

Customize agent behavior via the `contest_trade/config/belief_list.json` file. This allows you to tailor the system to your specific investment style.

*   **Example 1 (Aggressive):**

    ```json
    [
      "Focus on short-term event-driven opportunities: prioritize company announcements, M&A and restructuring, sudden order increases, technological breakthroughs and other catalysts; prefer mid/small-cap, high-volatility thematic stocks, suitable for aggressive arbitrage strategies."
    ]
    ```

*   **Example 2 (Conservative):**

    ```json
    [
      "Focus on stable, high-certainty events: pay attention to dividends, buybacks, earnings forecast confirmations, major contract signings and policy tailwinds; prefer large-cap blue-chips with low volatility and high certainty, suitable for conservative allocation."
    ]
    ```

*   **Default Configuration:**

    ```json
    [
      "Based on the provided information, comprehensively consider each company's business dynamics, industry trends and potential market impact. Recommend stock portfolios with short-term investment potential for two groups: Group 1 â€” risk-seekers (prefer high volatility, high returns, mid/low market cap stocks); Group 2 â€” conservative investors (prefer low volatility, stable returns, large-cap stocks).",
      "Based on recent sudden events, policy adjustments and company announcements as catalysts, combined with market sentiment transmission paths and capital game features. Screen event-driven opportunities for two different styles: Group 1 â€” aggressive arbitrage (prefer restructuring expectation, sudden order increases, technical breakthroughs in small-cap stocks); Group 2 â€” defensive arbitrage (prefer dividend increases, large buybacks, acquisition of franchise rights in blue-chip stocks). Pay attention to northbound capital movement and institutional seat trends on the trading leaderboard for resonance effects."
    ]
    ```
