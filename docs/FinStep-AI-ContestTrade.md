# ContestTrade: Automated AI-Driven Multi-Agent Trading Framework

**ContestTrade** is a cutting-edge, open-source framework that utilizes a multi-agent system and internal contest mechanisms to automatically identify and capitalize on event-driven trading opportunities. Explore the original repository: [https://github.com/FinStep-AI/ContestTrade](https://github.com/FinStep-AI/ContestTrade).

## Key Features

*   **Automated Stock Selection:**  Automatically scans the entire market to identify potential investment opportunities, eliminating the need for manual screening.
*   **Event-Driven Strategy:** Focuses on catalysts like news, announcements, capital flows, and policy changes to pinpoint high-impact investment events.
*   **Multi-Agent Architecture:** Leverages a team of specialized agents for data processing, research, and decision-making, mimicking a professional investment firm.
*   **Customizable Configuration:** Allows users to tailor agent strategies and preferences to align with specific investment styles and risk profiles.
*   **Multi-Market Support:** Supports US stock market data (with plans for Hong Kong and other markets).
*   **CLI Interface:** Provides a user-friendly command-line interface for easy operation and result visualization.

## Introduction

ContestTrade is a sophisticated multi-agent trading framework designed to automate the discovery, evaluation, and tracking of event-driven opportunities in the stock market. The system aims to provide actionable asset allocation recommendations without human intervention. It achieves this through a two-stage pipeline, the Data Processing Stage and Research and Decision-Making Stage.

## Framework Overview

<p align="center">
  <img src="assets/architecture.jpg" style="width: 90%; height: auto;">
</p>

ContestTrade's workflow operates in two primary stages:

1.  **Data Processing Stage:** Raw market data is fed to the **Data Team**. Data Analysis Agents work in parallel to create structured "textual factors." The internal contest mechanism evaluates these factors, building an optimal "factor portfolio."
2.  **Research and Decision-Making Stage:** The factor portfolio is passed to the **Research Team**. Research Agents analyze factors and submit trading proposals. A second contest evaluates the proposals, producing a unified asset allocation strategy.

## Installation

To get started with ContestTrade, follow these steps:

```bash
# 1. Clone the project repository
git clone https://github.com/FinStep-AI/ContestTrade.git
cd ContestTrade

# 2. (Recommended) Create and activate a virtual environment
conda create -n contesttrade python=3.10
conda activate contesttrade

# 3. Install project dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Alternatively, deploy with [Docker](https://docs.n8n.io/hosting/installation/docker/):

```
docker run -it --rm --name contest_trade -v $(pwd)/config.yaml:/ContestTrade/config.yaml finstep/contesttrade:v2.0
```

## Configuration

Configure API keys and LLM parameters by editing the `config_us.yaml` file. Here's a table of required and optional keys:

| Key                      | Description                                | Required |
| :----------------------- | :----------------------------------------- | :------- |
| `TUSHARE_KEY`            | Tushare data interface key                 | No       |
| `BOCHA_KEY`              | Bocha search engine key                    | No       |
| `SERP_KEY`               | SerpAPI search engine key                  | No       |
| `FMP_KEY`                | FMP API key                                | **Yes**  |
| `FINNHUB_KEY`            | Finnhub API key                            | No       |
| `ALPHA_VANTAGE_KEY`      | Alpha Vantage API key                      | **Yes** |
| `POLYGON_KEY`            | Polygon API key                            | **Yes** |
| `LLM_API_KEY`            | LLM API key for general tasks              | **Yes** |
| `LLM_BASE_URL`           | LLM API base URL for general tasks         | **Yes** |
| `LLM_THINKING_API_KEY`   | LLM API key for complex reasoning          | No       |
| `LLM_THINKING_BASE_URL`  | LLM API base URL for complex reasoning     | No       |
| `VLM_API_KEY`            | VLM API key for visual analysis            | No       |
| `VLM_BASE_URL`           | VLM API base URL for visual analysis       | No       |

> Note:  LLM and VLM API keys and URLs need to be applied for separately.

## Preference

Each Research Agent corresponds to a "trading belief," determining its investment signals. Configure these beliefs in `contest_trade/config/belief_list.json`.

Example short-term event-driven preference:

```json
[
  "Focus on short-term event-driven opportunities: prioritize company announcements, M&A and restructuring, sudden order increases, technological breakthroughs and other catalysts; prefer mid/small-cap, high-volatility thematic stocks, suitable for aggressive arbitrage strategies."
]
```

Example conservative preference:

```json
[
  "Focus on stable, high-certainty events: pay attention to dividends, buybacks, earnings forecast confirmations, major contract signings and policy tailwinds; prefer large-cap blue-chips with low volatility and high certainty, suitable for conservative allocation."
]
```

## Usage

Run ContestTrade using the Command Line Interface (CLI):

```bash
python -m cli.main run
```

Follow the prompts to select the market and view the results, including detailed research and data analysis reports, which are saved in the `contest_trade/agents_workspace/results` directory.

## ðŸŒŸ Vision & Roadmap

The project aims to explore new quantitative trading paradigms in the AGI era.

### Roadmap

**V1.1 (Finished): Framework Stability Enhancement & Core Experience Optimization**
- [âœ“] The core data source module is decoupled to achieve adaptors for multiple data sources. (`data-provider` refactor)
- [âœ“] Optimized CLI logging and interaction experience.

**V2.0 (Finished): Market and Function Expansion**
- [âœ“] Access to **US stock** market data.
- [âœ“] Introduced richer factors and signal sources.

**Future Plans:**
- [ ] Support for Hong Kong stocks and other markets
- [ ] Visual backtesting and analysis interface
