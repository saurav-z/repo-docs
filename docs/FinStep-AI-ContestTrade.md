# ContestTrade: Revolutionizing AI-Driven Trading with a Multi-Agent Framework

**ContestTrade** is an innovative, open-source, multi-agent trading framework designed to automate event-driven stock selection, empowering you to build a dedicated AI trading team.  Access the original repository [here](https://github.com/FinStep-AI/ContestTrade).

## Key Features

*   **Automated Stock Selection:**  The system performs whole-market scanning and signal generation, automatically producing tradable stock lists without manual intervention.
*   **Event-Driven Strategy:**  Focuses on opportunities triggered by catalysts like news, announcements, capital flows, and policy changes, targeting high-impact information events.
*   **Personalized Configuration:** Supports user-defined agent research preferences and strategies, enabling flexible adaptation to different investment styles.
*   **Multi-Agent Architecture:** Employs a two-stage pipeline with data and research teams, simulating the decision-making process of an investment firm.
*   **Open Source:**  A community-driven project welcoming contributions from developers and users.

## Introduction

ContestTrade is a cutting-edge, multi-agent trading framework specifically focused on event-driven stock selection. The primary objective of this system is to automatically identify, assess, and monitor event-driven opportunities with investment potential. The ultimate goal is to provide executable asset allocation recommendations without requiring any human intervention.

## Framework Overview

<p align="center">
  <img src="assets/architecture.jpg" style="width: 90%; height: auto;">
</p>

The ContestTrade framework operates through a structured two-stage pipeline, emulating the dynamic decision-making process of an investment firm. This dual-contest architecture guarantees that the final decisions are based solely on the most robust and effective insights, thus ensuring strong adaptability and resilience within the complex market environment.

1.  **Data Processing Stage:** The process commences with feeding raw market data from multiple sources into the **Data Team**. Numerous Data Analysis Agents work in parallel to refine this raw data into structured "textual factors." During this stage, the internal contest mechanism evaluates the potential value of the factors generated by each data agent, constructing an optimal "factor portfolio."

2.  **Research and Decision-Making Stage:** The refined factor portfolio is then passed to the **Research Team**. Multiple Research Agents, each with unique "Trading Beliefs" and access to a powerful set of financial tools, conduct in-depth, parallel analyses of these factors. Subsequently, they submit their respective trading proposals. A second round of internal contests then evaluates these proposals, resulting in a unified and dependable asset allocation strategy as the final output.

## Installation

Get started with ContestTrade in a few simple steps:

```bash
# 1. Clone the project repository
git clone https://github.com/FinStep-AI/ContestTrade.git
cd ContestTrade

# 2. (Recommended) Create and activate a virtual environment
conda create -n contesttrade python=3.10
conda activate contesttrade

# 3. Install project dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Alternatively, deploy using Docker:

```
docker run -it --rm --name contest_trade -v $(pwd)/config.yaml:/ContestTrade/config.yaml finstep/contesttrade:v2.0
```

## Preference

Customize your trading strategy by configuring Research Agent "trading beliefs".  The configuration file is located at `contest_trade/config/belief_list.json`.

Example:

*   **Short-term Event-Driven (Aggressive):**
    ```json
    [
      "Focus on short-term event-driven opportunities: prioritize company announcements, M&A and restructuring, sudden order increases, technological breakthroughs and other catalysts; prefer mid/small-cap, high-volatility thematic stocks, suitable for aggressive arbitrage strategies."
    ]
    ```

*   **Stable Events (Conservative):**
    ```json
    [
      "Focus on stable, high-certainty events: pay attention to dividends, buybacks, earnings forecast confirmations, major contract signings and policy tailwinds; prefer large-cap blue-chips with low volatility and high certainty, suitable for conservative allocation."
    ]
    ```

## Usage

Run ContestTrade using the Command Line Interface (CLI).

```bash
python -m cli.main run
```

After starting, you can choose the market to analyze via the terminal interface.  The default analysis time is the current time.
