# ContestTrade: Your AI-Powered Advantage in Event-Driven Trading

**ContestTrade** is a cutting-edge, multi-agent trading framework designed to autonomously identify and capitalize on event-driven investment opportunities, all without human intervention. ([View the source code on GitHub](https://github.com/FinStep-AI/ContestTrade))

## Key Features

*   **Automated Stock Selection:**  Scans the entire market and generates tradable stock lists based on potential events.
*   **Event-Driven Focus:** Prioritizes opportunities triggered by catalysts like news, announcements, and policy changes.
*   **Customizable Strategy:** Supports user-defined agent preferences and strategies for flexible adaptation to different investment styles.
*   **Multi-Agent Architecture:** Utilizes a two-stage contest framework, mimicking investment firm workflows, for robust decision-making.
*   **Market Expansion:** Includes support for US stock market data (V2.0).

## Overview: The ContestTrade Framework

<p align="center">
  <img src="assets/architecture.jpg" style="width: 90%; height: auto;">
</p>

ContestTrade's workflow is a structured two-stage pipeline, mimicking the dynamic decision-making process of an investment firm. This dual-contest framework ensures that final decisions are driven only by the most robust and effective insights, maintaining strong adaptability and resilience in complex markets.

1.  **Data Processing Stage:**  The **Data Team** receives raw market data from various sources. Multiple Data Analysis Agents process this data into structured "textual factors." An internal contest mechanism then evaluates the factors, resulting in an optimal "factor portfolio."

2.  **Research and Decision-Making Stage:** The factor portfolio is passed to the **Research Team**. Research Agents, each with their "Trading Beliefs," conduct analyses and submit trading proposals. A second contest evaluates these proposals, generating a unified asset allocation strategy.

## Installation

Get started with ContestTrade by following these steps:

```bash
# 1. Clone the project repository
git clone https://github.com/FinStep-AI/ContestTrade.git
cd ContestTrade

# 2. (Recommended) Create and activate a virtual environment
conda create -n contesttrade python=3.10
conda activate contesttrade

# 3. Install project dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Alternatively, deploy with [Docker](https://docs.n8n.io/hosting/installation/docker/):

```bash
docker run -it --rm --name contest_trade -v $(pwd)/config.yaml:/ContestTrade/config.yaml finstep/contesttrade:v2.0
```

## Preference: Defining Your Trading Beliefs

Customize agent behavior through the `contest_trade/config/belief_list.json` file. This file uses a JSON array of strings to define trading preferences.

**Example 1: Short-Term, Aggressive Approach**

```json
[
  "Focus on short-term event-driven opportunities: prioritize company announcements, M&A and restructuring, sudden order increases, technological breakthroughs and other catalysts; prefer mid/small-cap, high-volatility thematic stocks, suitable for aggressive arbitrage strategies."
]
```

**Example 2: Stable, Conservative Approach**

```json
[
  "Focus on stable, high-certainty events: pay attention to dividends, buybacks, earnings forecast confirmations, major contract signings and policy tailwinds; prefer large-cap blue-chips with low volatility and high certainty, suitable for conservative allocation."
]
```

**Default Configuration:**

```json
[
  "Based on the provided information, comprehensively consider each company's business dynamics, industry trends and potential market impact. Recommend stock portfolios with short-term investment potential for two groups: Group 1 â€” risk-seekers (prefer high volatility, high returns, mid/low market cap stocks); Group 2 â€” conservative investors (prefer low volatility, stable returns, large-cap stocks).",
  "Based on recent sudden events, policy adjustments and company announcements as catalysts, combined with market sentiment transmission paths and capital game features. Screen event-driven opportunities for two different styles: Group 1 â€” aggressive arbitrage (prefer restructuring expectation, sudden order increases, technical breakthroughs in small-cap stocks); Group 2 â€” defensive arbitrage (prefer dividend increases, large buybacks, acquisition of franchise rights in blue-chip stocks). Pay attention to northbound capital movement and institutional seat trends on the trading leaderboard for resonance effects."
]
```
