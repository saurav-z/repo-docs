## Key Features

*   **Automated Stock Selection:**  Scans the entire market to generate tradable stock lists, eliminating the need for manual screening.
*   **Event-Driven Strategy:** Focuses on catalysts such as news, announcements, capital flows, and policy changes to identify high-impact opportunities.
*   **Customizable Configuration:**  Allows users to define agent research preferences and strategies, adapting to various investment styles.
*   **Multi-Agent Architecture:** Employs a two-stage pipeline with a dual-contest mechanism to ensure robust and reliable decision-making.

## Introduction

ContestTrade is a powerful multi-agent trading framework centered around event-driven stock selection. The system autonomously discovers, evaluates, and tracks event-driven opportunities to provide actionable asset allocation recommendations without human intervention.

## Architecture

<p align="center">
  <img src="assets/architecture.jpg" style="width: 90%; height: auto;">
</p>

ContestTrade operates in a two-stage process, simulating a financial firm's decision-making. This design utilizes a dual-contest framework to ensure final decisions are driven by the most reliable insights.

1.  **Data Processing Stage:** Raw market data from multiple sources is processed by the **Data Team**. Data Analysis Agents transform the raw data into structured textual factors, which are then evaluated by an internal contest mechanism. The mechanism constructs an optimal "factor portfolio".

2.  **Research and Decision-Making Stage:**  The optimal factor portfolio is then passed to the **Research Team**. Research Agents analyze these factors, submit trading proposals, and undergo a second round of internal contests.  The output is a unified and reliable asset allocation strategy.

## Installation

```bash
# 1. Clone the project repository
git clone https://github.com/FinStep-AI/ContestTrade.git
cd ContestTrade

# 2. (Recommended) Create and activate a virtual environment
conda create -n contesttrade python=3.10
conda activate contesttrade

# 3. Install project dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Alternatively, deploy with [Docker](https://docs.n8n.io/hosting/installation/docker/):

## Preference Configuration

Customize each Research Agent's "trading belief" by modifying the `contest_trade/config/belief_list.json` file.

*Example 1: Short-Term, Aggressive*
```json
[
  "Focus on short-term event-driven opportunities: prioritize company announcements, M&A and restructuring, sudden order increases, technological breakthroughs and other catalysts; prefer mid/small-cap, high-volatility thematic stocks, suitable for aggressive arbitrage strategies."
]
```

*Example 2: Stable, Conservative*
```json
[
  "Focus on stable, high-certainty events: pay attention to dividends, buybacks, earnings forecast confirmations, major contract signings and policy tailwinds; prefer large-cap blue-chips with low volatility and high certainty, suitable for conservative allocation."
]
```

*Default Configuration*
```json
[
  "Based on the provided information, comprehensively consider each company's business dynamics, industry trends and potential market impact. Recommend stock portfolios with short-term investment potential for two groups: Group 1 â€” risk-seekers (prefer high volatility, high returns, mid/low market cap stocks); Group 2 â€” conservative investors (prefer low volatility, stable returns, large-cap stocks).",
  "Based on recent sudden events, policy adjustments and company announcements as catalysts, combined with market sentiment transmission paths and capital game features. Screen event-driven opportunities for two different styles: Group 1 â€” aggressive arbitrage (prefer restructuring expectation, sudden order increases, technical breakthroughs in small-cap stocks); Group 2 â€” defensive arbitrage (prefer dividend increases, large buybacks, acquisition of franchise rights in blue-chip stocks). Pay attention to northbound capital movement and institutional seat trends on the trading leaderboard for resonance effects."
]
```
