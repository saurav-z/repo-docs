# ContestTrade: An AI-Powered Multi-Agent Trading Framework

**ContestTrade** is an innovative multi-agent system designed to automate and optimize event-driven trading strategies.  [Explore the code on GitHub](https://github.com/FinStep-AI/ContestTrade).

## Key Features

*   **Automated Stock Selection:** Scans the entire market and generates tradable stock lists without manual intervention.
*   **Event-Driven Strategy:**  Focuses on opportunities triggered by news, announcements, capital flows, and policy changes.
*   **Customizable Agents:** Supports user-defined research preferences and trading strategies.
*   **Multi-Agent Framework:** Employs a two-stage pipeline with internal contests to ensure robust and effective trading decisions.
*   **US Stock Market Support:** Provides access to US stock market data.
*   **CLI Interface:** Offers a command-line interface for easy use and report viewing.

## Introduction

ContestTrade is a pioneering multi-agent trading framework that leverages AI to identify and capitalize on event-driven investment opportunities.  The system autonomously discovers, evaluates, and tracks event-driven opportunities, providing actionable asset allocation recommendations.

## Framework Overview

<p align="center">
  <img src="assets/architecture.jpg" style="width: 90%; height: auto;">
</p>

ContestTrade operates through a two-stage pipeline, simulating the decision-making process of an investment firm:

1.  **Data Processing Stage:**  Raw market data is processed by the **Data Team**, with multiple Data Analysis Agents generating "textual factors." An internal contest mechanism then constructs an optimal "factor portfolio."
2.  **Research and Decision-Making Stage:** This optimal factor portfolio is analyzed by the **Research Team**. Research Agents, each with unique "Trading Beliefs," conduct in-depth analyses and propose trading strategies. A second round of internal contests synthesizes these proposals into a unified asset allocation strategy.

## Installation

1.  **Clone the Repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/FinStep-AI/ContestTrade.git
    cd ContestTrade
    ```
2.  **(Recommended) Create and Activate a Virtual Environment:**
    ```bash
    conda create -n contesttrade python=3.10
    conda activate contesttrade
    ```
3.  **Install Dependencies:**
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

**Or, deploy with Docker:**

```bash
docker run -it --rm --name contest_trade -v $(pwd)/config.yaml:/ContestTrade/config.yaml finstep/contesttrade:v1.1
```

## Preference: Trading Beliefs Configuration

Customize agent behavior by configuring "trading beliefs" in `contest_trade/config/belief_list.json`.  This file is a JSON array of strings.

**Example: Short-term Event-Driven (Aggressive)**

```json
[
  "Focus on short-term event-driven opportunities: prioritize company announcements, M&A and restructuring, sudden order increases, technological breakthroughs and other catalysts; prefer mid/small-cap, high-volatility thematic stocks, suitable for aggressive arbitrage strategies."
]
```

**Example: Stable Events (Conservative)**

```json
[
  "Focus on stable, high-certainty events: pay attention to dividends, buybacks, earnings forecast confirmations, major contract signings and policy tailwinds; prefer large-cap blue-chips with low volatility and high certainty, suitable for conservative allocation."
]
```

**Default Configuration:**  (Included in original README)

## Usage

Run ContestTrade using the CLI:

```bash
python -m cli.main run
```

Follow the interactive terminal prompts to select a market and analyze.  Reports are saved in the `contest_trade/agents_workspace/results` directory in Markdown format.  (Images of CLI interaction, results, and reports included).
