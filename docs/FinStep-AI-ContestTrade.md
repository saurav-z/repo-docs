# ContestTrade: AI-Powered Multi-Agent Trading Framework

**ContestTrade** is an innovative, open-source framework empowering you to build and deploy an autonomous AI trading team that identifies and capitalizes on event-driven investment opportunities.  ([View on GitHub](https://github.com/FinStep-AI/ContestTrade))

## Key Features

*   **Automated Stock Selection:** Scans the entire market to generate tradable stock lists without manual intervention.
*   **Event-Driven Strategy:** Focuses on market catalysts like news, announcements, and policy changes to identify impactful opportunities.
*   **Customizable Agents:** Supports user-defined trading strategies and preferences to tailor the framework to different investment styles.
*   **Multi-Agent Architecture:**  Employs a dual-contest framework for robust decision-making, simulating an investment firm's workflow.
*   **Modular Design:** Easy to install and configure, with support for various data sources.
*   **Cross-Platform Support:** Run ContestTrade from the command line, or utilize Docker for easy deployment.
*   **Detailed Reporting:**  Generates comprehensive reports in Markdown format for analysis and sharing.

## Project Overview

ContestTrade is a multi-agent trading framework designed to automatically discover and evaluate event-driven investment opportunities, ultimately providing actionable asset allocation recommendations.  The system simulates an investment firm's workflow in two key stages:

1.  **Data Processing Stage:** The **Data Team** refines raw market data using multiple Data Analysis Agents, generating textual factors. An internal contest mechanism then evaluates these factors to create an optimal "factor portfolio."
2.  **Research and Decision-Making Stage:** The optimal factor portfolio is passed to the **Research Team**. Multiple Research Agents, each with unique "Trading Beliefs," analyze the factors and propose trading strategies. A second internal contest synthesizes these proposals for a final, reliable asset allocation strategy.

## Installation

Follow these steps to get started:

```bash
# 1. Clone the project repository
git clone https://github.com/FinStep-AI/ContestTrade.git
cd ContestTrade

# 2. (Recommended) Create and activate a virtual environment
conda create -n contesttrade python=3.10
conda activate contesttrade

# 3. Install project dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Alternatively, deploy using Docker:

```bash
docker run -it --rm --name contest_trade -v $(pwd)/config.yaml:/ContestTrade/config.yaml finstep/contesttrade:v1.1
```

## Configuration

Before running ContestTrade, configure your API keys and LLM parameters in `config_us.yaml`.

## Preferences

Customize each Research Agent's "trading belief" by editing the `contest_trade/config/belief_list.json` file.  The file contains a JSON array of strings defining the agent's investment style.

**Examples:**

*   **Short-term event-driven (Aggressive):**
    ```json
    [
      "Focus on short-term event-driven opportunities: prioritize company announcements, M&A and restructuring, sudden order increases, technological breakthroughs and other catalysts; prefer mid/small-cap, high-volatility thematic stocks, suitable for aggressive arbitrage strategies."
    ]
    ```

*   **Stable events (Conservative):**
    ```json
    [
      "Focus on stable, high-certainty events: pay attention to dividends, buybacks, earnings forecast confirmations, major contract signings and policy tailwinds; prefer large-cap blue-chips with low volatility and high certainty, suitable for conservative allocation."
    ]
    ```

**Default Configuration:**
```json
[
  "Based on the provided information, comprehensively consider each company's business dynamics, industry trends and potential market impact. Recommend stock portfolios with short-term investment potential for two groups: Group 1 â€” risk-seekers (prefer high volatility, high returns, mid/low market cap stocks); Group 2 â€” conservative investors (prefer low volatility, stable returns, large-cap stocks).",
  "Based on recent sudden events, policy adjustments and company announcements as catalysts, combined with market sentiment transmission paths and capital game features. Screen event-driven opportunities for two different styles: Group 1 â€” aggressive arbitrage (prefer restructuring expectation, sudden order increases, technical breakthroughs in small-cap stocks); Group 2 â€” defensive arbitrage (prefer dividend increases, large buybacks, acquisition of franchise rights in blue-chip stocks). Pay attention to northbound capital movement and institutional seat trends on the trading leaderboard for resonance effects."
]
```

## Usage

Run ContestTrade from the command line using the CLI:

```bash
python -m cli.main run
