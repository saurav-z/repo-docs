## Key Features

*   **Automated Stock Selection:**  Scan the entire market and automatically generate a list of tradable stocks, removing manual screening.
*   **Event-Driven Strategy:** Focuses on market catalysts, such as news, announcements, and policy changes, for high-impact investment opportunities.
*   **Customizable Configuration:**  Allows users to personalize agent research preferences and strategies for diverse investment styles.
*   **Multi-Agent Architecture:** Employs a two-stage pipeline with a data processing and research/decision-making phase to simulate an investment firm's decision-making process.

## Introduction

ContestTrade is a multi-agent trading framework focused on event-driven stock selection. The system's goal is to automatically discover, evaluate, and track event-driven opportunities with investment value without human intervention, and finally output executable asset allocation recommendations.

## Framework Overview

<p align="center">
  <img src="assets/architecture.jpg" style="width: 90%; height: auto;">
</p>

The framework utilizes a two-stage process, designed to replicate an investment firm's dynamic decision-making. This dual-contest system ensures that the most robust insights guide the final decisions, providing strong adaptability and resilience in complex markets.

1.  **Data Processing Stage:** The **Data Team** takes in market data from many sources. The data is refined into "textual factors" using several Data Analysis Agents working in parallel. The internal contest mechanism assesses the worth of each data agent's generated factors to create an optimal "factor portfolio."

2.  **Research and Decision-Making Stage:** The **Research Team** receives this factor portfolio. Each of the Research Agents, which have their own unique "Trading Beliefs" and access to powerful financial tools, analyzes these factors in depth. The trading proposals from each agent are then assessed in a second round of internal contests, resulting in a unified asset allocation strategy as the final output.

## Installation

```bash

## Preference

Each Research Agent uses a "trading belief." The system generates investment signals based on these beliefs combined with data and tools (each belief outputs up to 5 signals).  The configuration file is located at `contest_trade/config/belief_list.json`, and its format is a JSON array of strings.

Example 1 â€” preference for short-term event-driven (more aggressive):
```json
[
  "Focus on short-term event-driven opportunities: prioritize company announcements, M&A and restructuring, sudden order increases, technological breakthroughs and other catalysts; prefer mid/small-cap, high-volatility thematic stocks, suitable for aggressive arbitrage strategies."
]
```

Example 2 â€” preference for stable events (more conservative):
```json
[
  "Focus on stable, high-certainty events: pay attention to dividends, buybacks, earnings forecast confirmations, major contract signings and policy tailwinds; prefer large-cap blue-chips with low volatility and high certainty, suitable for conservative allocation."
]
```

Default configuration:
```json
[
  "Based on the provided information, comprehensively consider each company's business dynamics, industry trends and potential market impact. Recommend stock portfolios with short-term investment potential for two groups: Group 1 â€” risk-seekers (prefer high volatility, high returns, mid/low market cap stocks); Group 2 â€” conservative investors (prefer low volatility, stable returns, large-cap stocks).",
  "Based on recent sudden events, policy adjustments and company announcements as catalysts, combined with market sentiment transmission paths and capital game features. Screen event-driven opportunities for two different styles: Group 1 â€” aggressive arbitrage (prefer restructuring expectation, sudden order increases, technical breakthroughs in small-cap stocks); Group 2 â€” defensive arbitrage (prefer dividend increases, large buybacks, acquisition of franchise rights in blue-chip stocks). Pay attention to northbound capital movement and institutional seat trends on the trading leaderboard for resonance effects."
]
```

## Usage

Use the Command Line Interface (CLI) to run ContestTrade.

```bash
python -m cli.main run
```

The terminal interface launches after starting the program. Here, you can pick which market to analyze. The default analysis time is the present time.

## ðŸŒŸ Vision & Roadmap

We believe that the era of AGI is quickly approaching. We hope to use the open-source community's power to explore new frontiers in quantitative trading during the AGI era.

The project is focused on developing a more robust infrastructure, expanding the number of agents, exploring AI's limits in financial trading, and building a reliable, scalable agent trading framework.

### Roadmap

**V1.1 (Finished): Framework Stability Enhancement & Core Experience Optimization**
- [âœ“] The core data source module is decoupled to achieve adaptors for multiple data sources. (`data-provider` refactor)
- [âœ“] Optimized CLI logging and interaction experience.

**V2.0 (Finished): Market and Function Expansion**
- [âœ“] Access to **US stock** market data.
- [âœ“] Introduced richer factors and signal sources.

**Future Plans:**
- [ ] Support for Hong Kong stocks and other markets
- [ ] Visual backtesting and analysis interface
- [ ] Support for scaling up more agents
