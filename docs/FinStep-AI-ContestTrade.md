# ContestTrade: Revolutionizing AI-Driven Trading with a Multi-Agent Framework

**ContestTrade** is a cutting-edge multi-agent trading framework designed to autonomously identify, evaluate, and capitalize on event-driven investment opportunities.  Explore the original repo on [GitHub](https://github.com/FinStep-AI/ContestTrade) for more details.

## Key Features

*   **Automated Stock Selection:** Scans the entire market to generate tradable stock lists, eliminating the need for manual screening.
*   **Event-Driven Strategy:** Focuses on opportunities triggered by catalysts like news, announcements, and policy changes for significant information impact.
*   **Customizable Configurations:** Enables users to tailor agent research preferences and strategies, adapting to diverse investment styles.
*   **Multi-Agent Architecture:** Leverages a two-stage pipeline with data and research teams, mimicking an investment firm's decision-making process.
*   **US Stock Market Support:** Analyzes data from the US stock market, providing actionable insights.
*   **Open Source & Community Driven:** Built on open-source principles, we welcome and encourage contributions.

## Introduction

ContestTrade offers a unique approach to automated trading, focusing on event-driven stock selection within a multi-agent framework.  The system autonomously discovers, assesses, and tracks event-driven opportunities with the goal of generating actionable asset allocation recommendations without human intervention. The framework is designed to mimic the workflow of a financial firm's investment process.

## Framework Overview

<p align="center">
  <img src="assets/architecture.jpg" style="width: 90%; height: auto;">
</p>

ContestTrade operates through a two-stage pipeline designed to mimic the decision-making process of an investment firm.

1.  **Data Processing Stage:** The Data Team receives raw market data from various sources. Data Analysis Agents process the data into structured "textual factors," and the internal contest mechanism assesses the value of each agent's factors to construct an optimal "factor portfolio."

2.  **Research and Decision-Making Stage:** The Research Team receives the optimal factor portfolio. Research Agents, each with unique "Trading Beliefs" and access to financial tools, analyze the factors and submit trading proposals. A second internal contest evaluates the proposals, resulting in a unified asset allocation strategy.

## Installation

```bash
# 1. Clone the project repository
git clone https://github.com/FinStep-AI/ContestTrade.git
cd ContestTrade

# 2. (Recommended) Create and activate a virtual environment
conda create -n contesttrade python=3.10
conda activate contesttrade

# 3. Install project dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Or deploy with [Docker](https://docs.n8n.io/hosting/installation/docker/):

```
docker run -it --rm --name contest_trade -v $(pwd)/config.yaml:/ContestTrade/config.yaml finstep/contesttrade:v1.1
```

| `LLM_API_KEY`            | LLM API key for general tasks              | **Yes** |
| `LLM_BASE_URL`           | LLM API base URL for general tasks         | **Yes** |
| `LLM_THINKING_API_KEY`   | LLM API key for complex reasoning          | No       |
| `LLM_THINKING_BASE_URL`  | LLM API base URL for complex reasoning     | No       |
| `VLM_API_KEY`            | VLM API key for visual analysis            | No       |
| `VLM_BASE_URL`           | VLM API base URL for visual analysis       | No       |

> Note: You must obtain the LLM and VLM API keys and input the correct model names, base URLs, and API keys.

## Preference

Each Research Agent uses a "trading belief." Investment signals are generated based on these beliefs in combination with data and tools (up to 5 signals per belief). The configuration file, `contest_trade/config/belief_list.json`, is formatted as a JSON array of strings.

Example 1 â€” Preference for Short-Term Event-Driven (More Aggressive):

```json
[
  "Focus on short-term event-driven opportunities: prioritize company announcements, M&A and restructuring, sudden order increases, technological breakthroughs and other catalysts; prefer mid/small-cap, high-volatility thematic stocks, suitable for aggressive arbitrage strategies."
]
```

Example 2 â€” Preference for Stable Events (More Conservative):

```json
[
  "Focus on stable, high-certainty events: pay attention to dividends, buybacks, earnings forecast confirmations, major contract signings and policy tailwinds; prefer large-cap blue-chips with low volatility and high certainty, suitable for conservative allocation."
]
```

Default Configuration:

```json
[
  "Based on the provided information, comprehensively consider each company's business dynamics, industry trends and potential market impact. Recommend stock portfolios with short-term investment potential for two groups: Group 1 â€” risk-seekers (prefer high volatility, high returns, mid/low market cap stocks); Group 2 â€” conservative investors (prefer low volatility, stable returns, large-cap stocks).",
  "Based on recent sudden events, policy adjustments and company announcements as catalysts, combined with market sentiment transmission paths and capital game features. Screen event-driven opportunities for two different styles: Group 1 â€” aggressive arbitrage (prefer restructuring expectation, sudden order increases, technical breakthroughs in small-cap stocks); Group 2 â€” defensive arbitrage (prefer dividend increases, large buybacks, acquisition of franchise rights in blue-chip stocks). Pay attention to northbound capital movement and institutional seat trends on the trading leaderboard for resonance effects."
]
```

## Usage

Start ContestTrade using the Command Line Interface (CLI).

```bash
python -m cli.main run
```

After startup, you can choose the market to analyze via the terminal interface. The default analysis time is the current time.
