# ContestTrade: Unleash AI-Powered Event-Driven Trading 

**ContestTrade** is an innovative, multi-agent trading framework that empowers you to build and deploy your own AI trading team for event-driven investment strategies.  Check out the [original repository](https://github.com/FinStep-AI/ContestTrade) for more details.

## Key Features

*   **Automated Stock Selection:**  Scans the entire market to identify and generate tradable stock lists, eliminating the need for manual screening.
*   **Event-Driven Strategy:** Focuses on opportunities triggered by catalysts like news, announcements, capital flows, and policy changes to capitalize on significant information impacts.
*   **Personalized Configuration:** Allows users to define agent research preferences and trading strategies, adapting to various investment styles.
*   **Multi-Agent Architecture:** Employs a two-stage pipeline with a Data Team and Research Team, using an internal contest mechanism to refine decisions and ensure robustness.

## Overview: How ContestTrade Works

ContestTrade uses a two-stage pipeline mirroring a professional investment firm's decision-making process.

1.  **Data Processing Stage:**  Raw market data is processed by the **Data Team**, where multiple Data Analysis Agents extract textual factors. An internal contest mechanism evaluates these factors to create an optimal "factor portfolio."

2.  **Research and Decision-Making Stage:**  The factor portfolio is analyzed by the **Research Team**. Research Agents, with unique "Trading Beliefs," analyze factors and propose trades. Another internal contest synthesizes these proposals into a unified asset allocation strategy.

## Installation

Get started with ContestTrade quickly:

```bash
# 1. Clone the project repository
git clone https://github.com/FinStep-AI/ContestTrade.git
cd ContestTrade

# 2. (Recommended) Create and activate a virtual environment
conda create -n contesttrade python=3.10
conda activate contesttrade

# 3. Install project dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Alternatively, deploy with Docker:

```bash
docker run -it --rm --name contest_trade -v $(pwd)/config.yaml:/ContestTrade/config.yaml finstep/contesttrade:v1.1
```

## Configuration

Configure API keys and LLM parameters in `config_us.yaml`.

| `VLM_BASE_URL`           | VLM API base URL for visual analysis       | No       |

>  You'll need to obtain your own LLM and VLM API keys.  Fill in the necessary URLs, API Keys, and model names according to the platform and model you choose.

## Customizing Trading Beliefs (Preferences)

Customize each Research Agent's "trading belief" via the `contest_trade/config/belief_list.json` file.  Here are two examples:

**Example 1: Short-Term Event-Driven (Aggressive)**

```json
[
  "Focus on short-term event-driven opportunities: prioritize company announcements, M&A and restructuring, sudden order increases, technological breakthroughs and other catalysts; prefer mid/small-cap, high-volatility thematic stocks, suitable for aggressive arbitrage strategies."
]
```

**Example 2: Stable Events (Conservative)**

```json
[
  "Focus on stable, high-certainty events: pay attention to dividends, buybacks, earnings forecast confirmations, major contract signings and policy tailwinds; prefer large-cap blue-chips with low volatility and high certainty, suitable for conservative allocation."
]
```

## Usage

Run ContestTrade from the CLI:

```bash
python -m cli.main run
```

The CLI provides an interactive interface to select markets and view analysis results, including detailed research and data reports. Reports are saved in Markdown format within the `contest_trade/agents_workspace/results` directory.
