Frappe HR is a comprehensive, open-source Human Resources Management System (HRMS) designed to simplify and automate your HR operations. Built on the robust Frappe Framework, it offers a wide range of modules to manage the entire employee lifecycle, from onboarding to offboarding, payroll, and beyond.  Frappe HR is a separate product built upon modules within ERPNext after the modules matured.

*   **Expense Claims and Advances:** Streamline expense claims, manage employee advances, and implement multi-level approval workflows with seamless integration with ERPNext accounting.
*   **Performance Management:** Set and track goals, align goals with key result areas (KRAs), enable employee self-evaluations, and simplify appraisal cycles.
*   **Payroll & Taxation:**  Create salary structures, configure income tax slabs, run payroll, handle additional payments, and provide detailed salary slips.
