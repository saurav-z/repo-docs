## Installation

### Using uv (Recommended for consistent environments)

Install `uv` and then:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/EvolvingLMMs-Lab/lmms-eval
cd lmms-eval
uv sync  # This creates/updates your environment from uv.lock
```

To run commands:

```bash
uv run python -m lmms_eval --help
```

To add new dependencies:

```bash
uv add <package>
```

### Alternative Installation

For direct usage from Git:

```bash
uv venv eval
uv venv --python 3.12
source eval/bin/activate
uv pip install git+https://github.com/EvolvingLMMs-Lab/lmms-eval.git
```

<summary>Reproduction of LLaVA-1.5's paper results</summary>

See the [environment install script](miscs/repr_scripts.sh) and [torch environment info](miscs/repr_torch_envs.txt) to reproduce LLaVA-1.5's paper results. Variations can occur due to torch/cuda versions, and [results check](miscs/llava_result_check.md) is provided.

</details>

If you need to test on caption datasets like `coco`, `refcoco`, and `nocaps`, you'll need `java==1.8.0`.  Install with conda if needed:

```bash
conda install openjdk=8
```
Check with `java -version`.

python3 -m pip install httpx==0.23.3;
python3 -m pip install protobuf==3.20;
# If you are using numpy==2.x, sometimes may causing errors
python3 -m pip install numpy==1.26;
# Someties sentencepiece are required for tokenizer to work
python3 -m pip install sentencepiece;
```
