# LMMs-Eval: Evaluate and Accelerate Large Multimodal Model Development

**Tired of scattered benchmarks and slow evaluation?** LMMs-Eval provides a unified and efficient framework for evaluating large multimodal models (LMMs), supporting a wide range of tasks across text, image, video, and audio.  [Explore the LMMs-Eval Repository](https://github.com/EvolvingLMMs-Lab/lmms-eval).

---

## Key Features

*   **Comprehensive Task Support:** Evaluate LMMs across a vast array of tasks, including text, image, video, and audio, with over 100 supported tasks.
*   **Model Compatibility:**  Supports over 30 popular LMMs, ensuring flexibility and ease of integration.
*   **Accelerated Evaluation:**  Leverages technologies like vLLM and SGLang for faster and more efficient model evaluation.
*   **OpenAI API Compatibility:**  Supports evaluation of models compatible with the OpenAI API format.
*   **Reproducibility:** Includes scripts and resources to reproduce results from popular LMM papers, ensuring reliable benchmarking.
*   **Active Development:**  Continuously updated with new tasks, models, and features to stay at the forefront of LMM evaluation.
*   **Community Driven:**  Benefit from contributions and feedback from the open-source community.

## Installation

**Installation:**

```bash
curl -LsSf https://astral.sh/uv/install.sh | sh
uv venv eval
uv venv --python 3.12
source eval/bin/activate
uv pip install git+https://github.com/EvolvingLMMs-Lab/lmms-eval.git
```

For development:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/EvolvingLMMs-Lab/lmms-eval
cd lmms-eval
uv venv dev
source dev/bin/activate
uv pip install -e .
```

## Reproducing LLaVA-1.5 Paper Results

Check the [environment install script](miscs/repr_scripts.sh) and [torch environment info](miscs/repr_torch_envs.txt) to **reproduce LLaVA-1.5's paper results**. We found torch/cuda versions difference would cause small variations in the results, we provide the [results check](miscs/llava_result_check.md) with different environments.

## Dataset Results

Comprehensive evaluation results of the LLaVA series models are provided in the following resources:

*   Detailed results are available in a [Google Sheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1a5ImfdKATDI8T7Cwh6eH-bEsnQFzanFraFUgcS9KHWc/edit?usp=sharing).
*   Raw data exported from Weights & Biases is available [here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1AvaEmuG4csSmXaHjgu4ei1KBMmNNW8wflOD_kkTDdv8/edit?usp=sharing).

## Usages

**Evaluation of OpenAI-Compatible Model**

```bash
bash examples/models/openai_compatible.sh
bash examples/models/xai_grok.sh
```

**Evaluation of vLLM**

```bash
bash examples/models/vllm_qwen2vl.sh
```

**Evaluation of LLaVA-OneVision**

```bash
bash examples/models/llava_onevision.sh
```

**Evaluation of LLaMA-3.2-Vision**

```bash
bash examples/models/llama_vision.sh
```

**Evaluation of Qwen2-VL**

```bash
bash examples/models/qwen2_vl.sh
bash examples/models/qwen2_5_vl.sh
```

**Evaluation of LLaVA on MME**

If you want to test LLaVA 1.5, you will have to clone their repo from [LLaVA](https://github.com/haotian-liu/LLaVA) and

```bash
bash examples/models/llava_next.sh
```

**Evaluation with tensor parallel for bigger model (llava-next-72b)**

```bash
bash examples/models/tensor_parallel.sh
```

**Evaluation with SGLang for bigger model (llava-next-72b)**

```bash
bash examples/models/sglang.sh
```

**Evaluation with vLLM for bigger model (llava-next-72b)**

```bash
bash examples/models/vllm_qwen2vl.sh
```

**More Parameters**

```bash
python3 -m lmms_eval --help
```

**Environmental Variables**

Before running experiments and evaluations, we recommend you to export following environment variables to your environment. Some are necessary for certain tasks to run.

```bash
export OPENAI_API_KEY="<YOUR_API_KEY>"
export HF_HOME="<Path to HF cache>" 
export HF_TOKEN="<YOUR_API_KEY>"
export HF_HUB_ENABLE_HF_TRANSFER="1"
export REKA_API_KEY="<YOUR_API_KEY>"
# Other possible environment variables include 
# ANTHROPIC_API_KEY,DASHSCOPE_API_KEY etc.
```

**Common Environment Issues**

Sometimes you might encounter some common issues for example error related to httpx or protobuf. To solve these issues, you can first try

```bash
python3 -m pip install httpx==0.23.3;
python3 -m pip install protobuf==3.20;
# If you are using numpy==2.x, sometimes may causing errors
python3 -m pip install numpy==1.26;
# Someties sentencepiece are required for tokenizer to work
python3 -m pip install sentencepiece;
```

## Add Customized Model and Dataset

Please refer to our [documentation](docs/README.md).
