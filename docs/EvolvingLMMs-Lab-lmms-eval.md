LMMs-Eval provides a robust and efficient platform for evaluating Large Multimodal Models (LMMs) across a wide range of tasks, supporting text, image, video, and audio modalities. It simplifies the complex process of benchmarking LMMs, allowing researchers and developers to focus on innovation.

**Key Features:**

*   **Extensive Task Support:** Evaluate LMMs across **100+ tasks**, including visual question answering, video understanding, and more.
*   **Model Compatibility:** Supports evaluation of **30+ models**, including LLaVA, Qwen-VL, and models compatible with OpenAI API.
*   **Accelerated Evaluation:** Integrates `vllm` for faster inference and supports SGLang Runtime API for optimized performance with larger models.
*   **Flexible Installation:** Offers multiple installation methods, including `uv` for consistent environments, and direct installation from Git.
*   **Comprehensive Documentation:** Provides clear documentation for adding custom models, datasets and reproduction of results.
*   **Community Driven:** Active development with contributions from researchers and developers, fostering collaboration and continuous improvement.

## Installation

### Using `uv` (Recommended)

```bash
curl -LsSf https://astral.sh/uv/install.sh | sh
git clone https://github.com/EvolvingLMMs-Lab/lmms-eval
cd lmms-eval
uv sync
uv run python -m lmms_eval --help
uv add <package>
```

### Alternative Installation

```bash
uv venv eval
uv venv --python 3.12
source eval/bin/activate
uv pip install git+https://github.com/EvolvingLMMs-Lab/lmms-eval.git
```

<summary>Reproducing LLaVA-1.5 Results</summary>
You can check the [environment install script](miscs/repr_scripts.sh) and [torch environment info](miscs/repr_torch_envs.txt) to **reproduce LLaVA-1.5's paper results**. We found torch/cuda versions difference would cause small variations in the results, we provide the [results check](miscs/llava_result_check.md) with different environments.
</details>

If you want to test on caption dataset such as `coco`, `refcoco`, and `nocaps`, you will need to have `java==1.8.0` to let pycocoeval api to work. If you don't have it, you can install by using conda
```
conda install openjdk=8
```
you can then check your java version by `java -version`

<details>
<summary>Comprehensive Evaluation Results of LLaVA Family Models</summary>
<br>

As demonstrated by the extensive table below, we aim to provide detailed information for readers to understand the datasets included in lmms-eval and some specific details about these datasets (we remain grateful for any corrections readers may have during our evaluation process).

We provide a Google Sheet for the detailed results of the LLaVA series models on different datasets. You can access the sheet [here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1a5ImfdKATDI8T7Cwh6eH-bEsnQFzanFraFUgcS9KHWc/edit?usp=sharing). It's a live sheet, and we are updating it with new results.

If you want to test [VILA](https://github.com/NVlabs/VILA), you should install the following dependencies:

```bash
