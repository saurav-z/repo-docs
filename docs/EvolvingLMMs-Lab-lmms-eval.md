## Installation

### Using uv (Recommended for consistent environments)

Install `uv`:

```bash
curl -LsSf https://astral.sh/uv/install.sh | sh
```

Set up your environment with `uv`:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/EvolvingLMMs-Lab/lmms-eval
cd lmms-eval
uv sync  # This creates/updates your environment from uv.lock
```

Run commands using `uv`:

```bash
uv run python -m lmms_eval --help  # Run any command with uv run
```

Add dependencies with `uv`:

```bash
uv add <package>  # Updates both pyproject.toml and uv.lock
```

### Alternative Installation

Install from Git:

```bash
uv venv eval
uv venv --python 3.12
source eval/bin/activate
uv pip install git+https://github.com/EvolvingLMMs-Lab/lmms-eval.git
```

<summary>Reproduction of LLaVA-1.5's paper results</summary>

Check the [environment install script](miscs/repr_scripts.sh) and [torch environment info](miscs/repr_torch_envs.txt) to **reproduce LLaVA-1.5's paper results**. We found torch/cuda versions difference would cause small variations in the results, we provide the [results check](miscs/llava_result_check.md) with different environments.

</details>

If you need to test caption datasets like `coco`, `refcoco`, and `nocaps`, ensure you have `java==1.8.0` for the pycocoeval API to work, install with conda if needed:

```bash
conda install openjdk=8
```
Check your Java version using: `java -version`

```

**Environmental Variables**
Set environment variables before running evaluations.

```bash
export OPENAI_API_KEY="<YOUR_API_KEY>"
export HF_HOME="<Path to HF cache>" 
export HF_TOKEN="<YOUR_API_KEY>"
export HF_HUB_ENABLE_HF_TRANSFER="1"
export REKA_API_KEY="<YOUR_API_KEY>"

# ANTHROPIC_API_KEY,DASHSCOPE_API_KEY etc.
```

**Common Environment Issues**

Troubleshoot common errors, such as `httpx` or `protobuf`, by installing:

```bash
python3 -m pip install httpx==0.23.3;
python3 -m pip install protobuf==3.20;
# If you are using numpy==2.x, sometimes may causing errors
python3 -m pip install numpy==1.26;
# Someties sentencepiece are required for tokenizer to work
python3 -m pip install sentencepiece;
```

## Add Customized Model and Dataset

Key changes to the original API:
- Build context now only pass in idx and process image and doc during the model responding phase. This is due to the fact that dataset now contains lots of images and we can't store them in the doc like the original lm-eval-harness other wise the cpu memory would explode.
- Instance.args (lmms_eval/api/instance.py) now contains a list of images to be inputted to lmms.
- lm-eval-harness supports all HF language models as single model class. Currently this is not possible of lmms because the input/output format of lmms in HF are not yet unified. Thererfore, we have to create a new class for each lmms model. This is not ideal and we will try to unify them in the future.
