## What is FastStream?

FastStream is built upon the foundation of [**FastKafka**](https://github.com/airtai/fastkafka) and [**Propan**](https://github.com/lancetnik/propan), inheriting the best features to provide a unified way to write services that process streamed data regardless of the underlying protocol. It's ideal for modern, data-centric microservices.

---

## Installation

FastStream is compatible with **Linux**, **macOS**, **Windows**, and most **Unix**-style operating systems.

Install FastStream using `pip`:

```bash
pip install 'faststream[kafka]'
# or
pip install 'faststream[rabbit]'
# or
pip install 'faststream[nats]'
# or
pip install 'faststream[redis]'
```

*FastStream uses PydanticV2 written in Rust by default, but it will work correctly with PydanticV1 if needed.*

---

## Getting Started: Writing Application Code

FastStream provides function decorators `@broker.subscriber` and `@broker.publisher` to streamline consuming and producing data from event queues, automatically decoding and encoding JSON-encoded messages.

### Example

```python
from faststream import FastStream
from faststream.kafka import KafkaBroker

broker = KafkaBroker("localhost:9092")
app = FastStream(broker)

@broker.subscriber("in")
@broker.publisher("out")
async def handle_msg(user: str, user_id: int) -> str:
    return f"User: {user_id} - {user} registered"
```

### Utilizing Pydantic Models

FastStream seamlessly integrates with Pydantic's `BaseModel` for declarative message definition:

```python
from pydantic import BaseModel, Field, PositiveInt
from faststream import FastStream
from faststream.kafka import KafkaBroker

broker = KafkaBroker("localhost:9092")
app = FastStream(broker)

class User(BaseModel):
    user: str = Field(..., examples=["John"])
    user_id: PositiveInt = Field(..., examples=["1"])

@broker.subscriber("in")
@broker.publisher("out")
async def handle_msg(data: User) -> str:
    return f"User: {data.user} - {data.user_id} registered"
```

---

## Testing Your Service

FastStream's `TestBroker` context managers facilitate in-memory tests.

### Example (pytest)

```python
import pytest
import pydantic
from faststream.kafka import TestKafkaBroker

@pytest.mark.asyncio
async def test_correct():
    async with TestKafkaBroker(broker) as br:
        await br.publish({
            "user": "John",
            "user_id": 1,
        }, "in")

@pytest.mark.asyncio
async def test_invalid():
    async with TestKafkaBroker(broker) as br:
        with pytest.raises(pydantic.ValidationError):
            await br.publish("wrong message", "in")
```

---

## Running the Application

Use the FastStream CLI to run your application:

1.  **Install the CLI:**

    ```bash
    pip install "faststream[cli]"
    ```

2.  **Run your app:**

    ```bash
    faststream run basic:app
    ```

### Enhancements

*   `--reload` for hot reloading.
*   `--workers` for multiprocessing horizontal scaling.

    Learn more about CLI features [here](https://faststream.ag2.ai/latest/getting-started/cli/)

---

## Project Documentation

FastStream generates documentation based on the [**AsyncAPI**](https://www.asyncapi.com/) specification, making it easy to understand the application's channels and message formats.

![HTML-page](https://github.com/ag2ai/faststream/blob/main/docs/docs/assets/img/AsyncAPI-basic-html-short.png?raw=true)

---

## Dependency Injection

FastStream utilizes a dependency management system similar to `pytest fixtures` and `FastAPI Depends`:

```python
from faststream import Depends, Logger

async def base_dep(user_id: int) -> bool:
    return True

@broker.subscriber("in-test")
async def base_handler(user: str,
                       logger: Logger,
                       dep: bool = Depends(base_dep)):
    assert dep is True
    logger.info(user)
```

---

## HTTP Framework Integrations

### Any Framework

Integrate `MQBrokers` directly into your application's lifecycle:

```python
from aiohttp import web
from faststream.kafka import KafkaBroker

broker = KafkaBroker("localhost:9092")

@broker.subscriber("test")
async def base_handler(body):
    print(body)

async def start_broker(app):
    await broker.start()

async def stop_broker(app):
    await broker.stop()

async def hello(request):
    return web.Response(text="Hello, world")

app = web.Application()
app.add_routes([web.get("/", hello)])
app.on_startup.append(start_broker)
app.on_cleanup.append(stop_broker)

if __name__ == "__main__":
    web.run_app(app)
```

### FastAPI Plugin

Integrate FastStream with FastAPI using a `StreamRouter`:

```python
from fastapi import FastAPI
from pydantic import BaseModel
from faststream.kafka.fastapi import KafkaRouter

router = KafkaRouter("localhost:9092")

class Incoming(BaseModel):
    m: dict

@router.subscriber("test")
@router.publisher("response")
async def hello(m: Incoming):
    return {"response": "Hello, world!"}

app = FastAPI()
app.include_router(router)
```
