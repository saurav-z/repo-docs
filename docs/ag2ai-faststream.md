## Key Features

FastStream simplifies event-driven architectures, enabling you to build scalable and robust microservices with ease.

*   **Multiple Broker Support**: Work seamlessly with Kafka, RabbitMQ, NATS, and Redis.
*   **Pydantic Validation**: Leverage Pydantic for data validation and serialization.
*   **Automatic Docs**: Generate AsyncAPI documentation automatically for easy service integration.
*   **Type-Safe**: Benefit from full-typed editor support, catching errors early.
*   **Dependency Injection**: Utilize a powerful built-in dependency injection system.
*   **Testability**: Test your services efficiently with in-memory testing.
*   **Extensibility**: Customize with extensions for lifespans, serialization, and middleware.
*   **Framework Integrations**: Integrate with any HTTP framework, including FastAPI.

## History

FastStream builds upon the experiences of FastKafka and Propan, providing a unified approach to processing streamed data.  It's the recommended choice for new streaming service development.

---

## Installation

FastStream supports Linux, macOS, Windows, and most Unix-like systems. Install using pip:

```bash
pip install 'faststream[kafka]'  # For Kafka
pip install 'faststream[rabbit]' # For RabbitMQ
pip install 'faststream[nats]'   # For NATS
pip install 'faststream[redis]'  # For Redis
```

FastStream defaults to PydanticV2 (Rust), but gracefully degrades to PydanticV1 if needed.

---

## Writing App Code

Use `@broker.subscriber` and `@broker.publisher` decorators to define message consumers and producers.  FastStream handles parsing, networking, and documentation generation.

Here's a basic example:

```python
from faststream import FastStream
from faststream.kafka import KafkaBroker

broker = KafkaBroker("localhost:9092")
app = FastStream(broker)

@broker.subscriber("in")
@broker.publisher("out")
async def handle_msg(user: str, user_id: int) -> str:
    return f"User: {user_id} - {user} registered"
```

Use Pydantic models for data validation:

```python
from pydantic import BaseModel, Field, PositiveInt
from faststream import FastStream
from faststream.kafka import KafkaBroker

broker = KafkaBroker("localhost:9092")
app = FastStream(broker)

class User(BaseModel):
    user: str = Field(..., examples=["John"])
    user_id: PositiveInt = Field(..., examples=["1"])

@broker.subscriber("in")
@broker.publisher("out")
async def handle_msg(data: User) -> str:
    return f"User: {data.user} - {data.user_id} registered"
```

---

## Testing

Use `TestBroker` for in-memory testing with no external broker needed:

```python
import pytest
import pydantic
from faststream.kafka import TestKafkaBroker

@pytest.mark.asyncio
async def test_correct():
    async with TestKafkaBroker(broker) as br:
        await br.publish({
            "user": "John",
            "user_id": 1,
        }, "in")

@pytest.mark.asyncio
async def test_invalid():
    async with TestKafkaBroker(broker) as br:
        with pytest.raises(pydantic.ValidationError):
            await br.publish("wrong message", "in")
```

---

## Running the Application

Install the CLI:

```bash
pip install "faststream[cli]"
```

Run your app:

```bash
faststream run basic:app
```

Use `--reload` for hot reload and `--workers` for multiprocessing.  See [CLI documentation](https://faststream.ag2.ai/latest/getting-started/cli/) for details.

---

## Project Documentation

FastStream automatically generates AsyncAPI documentation.  This simplifies service integration.

![HTML-page](https://github.com/ag2ai/faststream/blob/main/docs/docs/assets/img/AsyncAPI-basic-html-short.png?raw=true)

---

## Dependencies

FastStream uses a dependency management system similar to pytest fixtures and FastAPI `Depends`.

```python
from faststream import Depends, Logger

async def base_dep(user_id: int) -> bool:
    return True

@broker.subscriber("in-test")
async def base_handler(user: str,
                       logger: Logger,
                       dep: bool = Depends(base_dep)):
    assert dep is True
    logger.info(user)
```

---

## Framework Integrations

### Any Framework

Use `MQBrokers` independently within any framework, starting and stopping them as needed:

```python
from aiohttp import web
from faststream.kafka import KafkaBroker

broker = KafkaBroker("localhost:9092")

@broker.subscriber("test")
async def base_handler(body):
    print(body)

async def start_broker(app):
    await broker.start()

async def stop_broker(app):
    await broker.stop()

async def hello(request):
    return web.Response(text="Hello, world")

app = web.Application()
app.add_routes([web.get("/", hello)])
app.on_startup.append(start_broker)
app.on_cleanup.append(stop_broker)

if __name__ == "__main__":
    web.run_app(app)
```

### FastAPI Plugin

Integrate with FastAPI using `KafkaRouter` and `@router.subscriber` and `@router.publisher`:

```python
from fastapi import FastAPI
from pydantic import BaseModel
from faststream.kafka.fastapi import KafkaRouter

router = KafkaRouter("localhost:9092")

class Incoming(BaseModel):
    m: dict

@router.subscriber("test")
@router.publisher("response")
async def hello(m: Incoming):
    return {"response": "Hello, world!"}

app = FastAPI()
app.include_router(router)
```
