## Background

FastStream builds upon the best ideas from FastKafka and Propan, offering a unified and streamlined approach to building event-driven microservices. It's designed for efficient data streaming regardless of the underlying protocol.  New development efforts are focused on this project.

---

## Installation

FastStream supports **Linux**, **macOS**, **Windows**, and most **Unix**-style operating systems. Install with pip:

```bash
pip install 'faststream[kafka]'  # or [rabbit, nats, redis]
```

FastStream uses **PydanticV2** by default but is also compatible with **PydanticV1**.

---

## Getting Started

FastStream provides decorators like `@broker.subscriber` and `@broker.publisher` for easily defining your message consumers and producers:

```python
from faststream import FastStream
from faststream.kafka import KafkaBroker

broker = KafkaBroker("localhost:9092")
app = FastStream(broker)

@broker.subscriber("in")
@broker.publisher("out")
async def handle_msg(user: str, user_id: int) -> str:
    return f"User: {user_id} - {user} registered"
```

Use Pydantic models for structured data:

```python
from pydantic import BaseModel, Field, PositiveInt
from faststream import FastStream
from faststream.kafka import KafkaBroker

broker = KafkaBroker("localhost:9092")
app = FastStream(broker)

class User(BaseModel):
    user: str = Field(..., examples=["John"])
    user_id: PositiveInt = Field(..., examples=["1"])

@broker.subscriber("in")
@broker.publisher("out")
async def handle_msg(data: User) -> str:
    return f"User: {data.user} - {data.user_id} registered"
```

---

## Testing

Use `TestKafkaBroker` context managers with pytest for testing:

```python
import pytest
import pydantic
from faststream.kafka import TestKafkaBroker

@pytest.mark.asyncio
async def test_correct():
    async with TestKafkaBroker(broker) as br:
        await br.publish({"user": "John", "user_id": 1,}, "in")

@pytest.mark.asyncio
async def test_invalid():
    async with TestKafkaBroker(broker) as br:
        with pytest.raises(pydantic.ValidationError):
            await br.publish("wrong message", "in")
```

---

## Running the Application

Install the FastStream CLI:

```bash
pip install "faststream[cli]"
```

Run your app:

```bash
faststream run basic:app
```

Use `--reload` for hot-reloading and `--workers` for multiprocessing.

---

## Project Documentation

FastStream automatically generates AsyncAPI documentation to ease service integration.

![HTML-page](https://github.com/ag2ai/faststream/blob/main/docs/docs/assets/img/AsyncAPI-basic-html-short.png?raw=true)

---

## Dependencies

FastStream uses a dependency management system (similar to pytest fixtures/FastAPI Depends) via FastDepends.

```python
from typing import Annotated
from faststream import Depends, Logger

async def base_dep(user_id: int) -> bool:
    return True

@broker.subscriber("in-test")
async def base_handler(user: str,
                       logger: Logger,
                       dep: Annotated[bool, Depends(base_dep)]):
    assert dep is True
    logger.info(user)
```

---

## Integration with HTTP Frameworks

### Any Framework

Use `MQBrokers` with your existing application:

```python
from aiohttp import web
from faststream.kafka import KafkaBroker

broker = KafkaBroker("localhost:9092")

@broker.subscriber("test")
async def base_handler(body):
    print(body)

async def start_broker(app):
    await broker.start()

async def stop_broker(app):
    await broker.stop()

async def hello(request):
    return web.Response(text="Hello, world")

app = web.Application()
app.add_routes([web.get("/", hello)])
app.on_startup.append(start_broker)
app.on_cleanup.append(stop_broker)

if __name__ == "__main__":
    web.run_app(app)
```

### FastAPI Plugin

Integrate FastStream with FastAPI using `KafkaRouter`:

```python
from fastapi import FastAPI
from pydantic import BaseModel
from faststream.kafka.fastapi import KafkaRouter

router = KafkaRouter("localhost:9092")

class Incoming(BaseModel):
    m: dict

@router.subscriber("test")
@router.publisher("response")
async def hello(m: Incoming):
    return {"response": "Hello, world!"}

app = FastAPI()
app.include_router(router)
```
