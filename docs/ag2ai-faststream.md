## Key Features of FastStream

*   **Multiple Broker Support:**  Connect seamlessly to various message brokers, including Kafka, RabbitMQ, NATS, and Redis.
*   **Pydantic Validation:** Leverage Pydantic for robust data validation and serialization of incoming messages.
*   **Automatic Documentation:**  Generate comprehensive AsyncAPI documentation to simplify service integration.
*   **Intuitive Development:** Benefit from full-typed editor support, reducing runtime errors and improving developer productivity.
*   **Dependency Injection:**  Manage dependencies efficiently with FastStream's built-in dependency injection system.
*   **Simplified Testing:** Utilize in-memory tests for faster and more reliable CI/CD pipelines.
*   **Extensibility:** Extend functionality with extensions for lifespans, custom serialization, and middleware.
*   **Flexible Integrations:** Integrate with any HTTP framework, especially with a dedicated FastAPI plugin.

## Getting Started

### Installation

Install FastStream using pip, including the desired broker support:

```bash
pip install 'faststream[kafka]'  # For Kafka
pip install 'faststream[rabbit]' # For RabbitMQ
pip install 'faststream[nats]'   # For NATS
pip install 'faststream[redis]'  # For Redis
```

### Basic Usage

FastStream simplifies event stream integration with function decorators for producers and consumers:

```python
from faststream import FastStream
from faststream.kafka import KafkaBroker

broker = KafkaBroker("localhost:9092")
app = FastStream(broker)

@broker.subscriber("in")
@broker.publisher("out")
async def handle_msg(user: str, user_id: int) -> str:
    return f"User: {user_id} - {user} registered"
```

### Message Models with Pydantic

Define message structures using Pydantic models for structured data handling:

```python
from pydantic import BaseModel, Field, PositiveInt
from faststream import FastStream
from faststream.kafka import KafkaBroker

broker = KafkaBroker("localhost:9092")
app = FastStream(broker)

class User(BaseModel):
    user: str = Field(..., examples=["John"])
    user_id: PositiveInt = Field(..., examples=["1"])

@broker.subscriber("in")
@broker.publisher("out")
async def handle_msg(data: User) -> str:
    return f"User: {data.user} - {data.user_id} registered"
```

### Testing

Use `TestBroker` for easy and isolated testing:

```python
import pytest
import pydantic
from faststream.kafka import TestKafkaBroker

@pytest.mark.asyncio
async def test_correct():
    async with TestKafkaBroker(broker) as br:
        await br.publish({
            "user": "John",
            "user_id": 1,
        }, "in")

@pytest.mark.asyncio
async def test_invalid():
    async with TestKafkaBroker(broker) as br:
        with pytest.raises(pydantic.ValidationError):
            await br.publish("wrong message", "in")
```

### Running the Application

Run your FastStream application using the CLI:

```bash
pip install "faststream[cli]"
faststream run basic:app
```

Improve your Development Experience with a hot reload feature:

```bash
faststream run basic:app --reload
```

And multiprocessing horizontal scaling feature as well:

```bash
faststream run basic:app --workers 3
```

## Project Documentation

**FastStream** automatically generates documentation for your project according to the [**AsyncAPI**](https://www.asyncapi.com/) specification. You can work with both generated artifacts and place a web view of your documentation on resources available to related teams.

The availability of such documentation significantly simplifies the integration of services: you can immediately see what channels and message formats the application works with. And most importantly, it won't cost anything - **FastStream** has already created the docs for you!

## Dependencies

**FastStream** (thanks to [**FastDepends**](https://lancetnik.github.io/FastDepends/)) has a dependency management system similar to `pytest fixtures` and `FastAPI Depends` at the same time. Function arguments declare which dependencies you want are needed, and a special decorator delivers them from the global Context object.

```python
from typing import Annotated
from faststream import Depends, Logger

async def base_dep(user_id: int) -> bool:
    return True

@broker.subscriber("in-test")
async def base_handler(user: str,
                       logger: Logger,
                       dep: Annotated[bool, Depends(base_dep)]):
    assert dep is True
    logger.info(user)
```

---

## Integrations

### Any Framework

You can use **FastStream** `MQBrokers` without a `FastStream` application.
Just *start* and *stop* them according to your application's lifespan.

```python
from aiohttp import web

from faststream.kafka import KafkaBroker

broker = KafkaBroker("localhost:9092")

@broker.subscriber("test")
async def base_handler(body):
    print(body)

async def start_broker(app):
    await broker.start()

async def stop_broker(app):
    await broker.stop()

async def hello(request):
    return web.Response(text="Hello, world")

app = web.Application()
app.add_routes([web.get("/", hello)])
app.on_startup.append(start_broker)
app.on_cleanup.append(stop_broker)

if __name__ == "__main__":
    web.run_app(app)
```

### **FastAPI** Plugin

Also, **FastStream** can be used as part of **FastAPI**.

Just import a **StreamRouter** you need and declare the message handler with the same `@router.subscriber(...)` and `@router.publisher(...)` decorators.

```python
from fastapi import FastAPI
from pydantic import BaseModel

from faststream.kafka.fastapi import KafkaRouter

router = KafkaRouter("localhost:9092")

class Incoming(BaseModel):
    m: dict

@router.subscriber("test")
@router.publisher("response")
async def hello(m: Incoming):
    return {"response": "Hello, world!"}

app = FastAPI()
app.include_router(router)
```
