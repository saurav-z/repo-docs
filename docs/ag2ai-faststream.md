## Key Features of FastStream

FastStream is a Python framework designed to simplify the development of microservices that leverage event streaming. It simplifies the process of writing producers and consumers for message queues, handling parsing, networking, and documentation generation automatically. Key features include:

*   **Multiple Broker Support**:  Work with various message brokers, including Kafka, RabbitMQ, NATS, and Redis, through a unified API.
*   **Pydantic Validation**: Utilize Pydantic for data validation, ensuring data integrity.
*   **Automatic Documentation**: Generate AsyncAPI documentation automatically to simplify service integration.
*   **Intuitive Development**: Benefit from full-typed editor support to catch errors early in development.
*   **Powerful Dependency Injection**: Manage service dependencies efficiently with FastStream's built-in DI system.
*   **Testability**: Supports in-memory testing for faster and more reliable CI/CD pipelines.
*   **Extensibility**: Use extensions for lifespans, custom serialization, and middleware.
*   **Framework Agnostic**: Compatible with various HTTP frameworks, with specific plugins for FastAPI.

##  Why Choose FastStream?

FastStream is designed to make building modern, data-centric microservices easier, especially for developers of all experience levels. It streamlines your workflow while still supporting advanced use cases.

---

##  History and Origins

FastStream is the evolution of the ideas and experiences gained from [FastKafka](https://github.com/airtai/fastkafka) and [Propan](https://github.com/lancetnik/propan). This project combines the best aspects of both to offer a unified approach to handling streamed data, regardless of the underlying protocol. If you are starting a new service, this package is the recommended way to do it.

---

## Installation

FastStream is compatible with **Linux**, **macOS**, **Windows**, and most **Unix**-style operating systems. Install using pip:

```bash
pip install 'faststream[kafka]'
# or
pip install 'faststream[rabbit]'
# or
pip install 'faststream[nats]'
# or
pip install 'faststream[redis]'
```

FastStream defaults to **PydanticV2** which is written in **Rust**, but will function correctly with **PydanticV1** if necessary.

---

## Writing App Code

FastStream provides function decorators such as `@broker.subscriber` and `@broker.publisher` for easy interaction with message queues:

*   **Consuming and Producing Data:** Manage data consumption and production via event queues.
*   **JSON Handling:** Automatically decode and encode JSON-encoded messages.

Here's a basic example:

```python
from faststream import FastStream
from faststream.kafka import KafkaBroker
# from faststream.rabbit import RabbitBroker
# from faststream.nats import NatsBroker
# from faststream.redis import RedisBroker

broker = KafkaBroker("localhost:9092")
# broker = RabbitBroker("amqp://guest:guest@localhost:5672/")
# broker = NatsBroker("nats://localhost:4222/")
# broker = RedisBroker("redis://localhost:6379/")

app = FastStream(broker)

@broker.subscriber("in")
@broker.publisher("out")
async def handle_msg(user: str, user_id: int) -> str:
    return f"User: {user_id} - {user} registered"
```

You can also use Pydantic's `BaseModel` for defining messages:

```python
from pydantic import BaseModel, Field, PositiveInt
from faststream import FastStream
from faststream.kafka import KafkaBroker

broker = KafkaBroker("localhost:9092")
app = FastStream(broker)

class User(BaseModel):
    user: str = Field(..., examples=["John"])
    user_id: PositiveInt = Field(..., examples=["1"])

@broker.subscriber("in")
@broker.publisher("out")
async def handle_msg(data: User) -> str:
    return f"User: {data.user} - {data.user_id} registered"
```

---

## Testing Your Service

Use the `TestBroker` context managers for in-memory testing. Example with pytest:

```python
import pytest
import pydantic
from faststream.kafka import TestKafkaBroker

@pytest.mark.asyncio
async def test_correct():
    async with TestKafkaBroker(broker) as br:
        await br.publish({
            "user": "John",
            "user_id": 1,
        }, "in")

@pytest.mark.asyncio
async def test_invalid():
    async with TestKafkaBroker(broker) as br:
        with pytest.raises(pydantic.ValidationError):
            await br.publish("wrong message", "in")
```

---

## Running the Application

Install the FastStream CLI:

```bash
pip install "faststream[cli]"
```

Run your service:

```bash
faststream run basic:app
```

Additional CLI features:

*   Hot Reload: `faststream run basic:app --reload`
*   Multiprocessing: `faststream run basic:app --workers 3`

Learn more about CLI features [here](https://faststream.ag2.ai/latest/getting-started/cli/)

---

## Project Documentation

FastStream generates AsyncAPI documentation for your project automatically. You can work with both generated artifacts and place a web view of your documentation on resources available to related teams.

![HTML-page](https://github.com/ag2ai/faststream/blob/main/docs/docs/assets/img/AsyncAPI-basic-html-short.png?raw=true)

---

## Dependencies

FastStream's dependency management system is similar to `pytest fixtures` and `FastAPI Depends`.

```python
from typing import Annotated
from faststream import Depends, Logger

async def base_dep(user_id: int) -> bool:
    return True

@broker.subscriber("in-test")
async def base_handler(user: str,
                       logger: Logger,
                       dep: Annotated[bool, Depends(base_dep)]):
    assert dep is True
    logger.info(user)
```

---

## Framework Integrations

### Any Framework

Integrate `MQBrokers` into any framework by starting and stopping them as part of your application's lifecycle.

```python
from aiohttp import web

from faststream.kafka import KafkaBroker

broker = KafkaBroker("localhost:9092")

@broker.subscriber("test")
async def base_handler(body):
    print(body)

async def start_broker(app):
    await broker.start()

async def stop_broker(app):
    await broker.stop()

async def hello(request):
    return web.Response(text="Hello, world")

app = web.Application()
app.add_routes([web.get("/", hello)])
app.on_startup.append(start_broker)
app.on_cleanup.append(stop_broker)

if __name__ == "__main__":
    web.run_app(app)
```

### FastAPI Plugin

FastStream integrates seamlessly with FastAPI.

```python
from fastapi import FastAPI
from pydantic import BaseModel

from faststream.kafka.fastapi import KafkaRouter

router = KafkaRouter("localhost:9092")

class Incoming(BaseModel):
    m: dict

@router.subscriber("test")
@router.publisher("response")
async def hello(m: Incoming):
    return {"response": "Hello, world!"}

app = FastAPI()
app.include_router(router)
```
