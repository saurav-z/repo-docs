## Qwen-Image: Unleash Your Creativity with Advanced Image Generation and Editing

**Qwen-Image is a powerful 20B MMDiT image foundation model that excels at generating and editing images with exceptional text rendering capabilities, especially for Chinese.** ([Original Repo](https://github.com/QwenLM/Qwen-Image))

**Key Features:**

*   **Exceptional Text Rendering:** Accurately and seamlessly integrates text into images, supporting both English and Chinese, maintaining typographic details and layout coherence.
*   **Versatile Image Generation:** Create diverse images, from photorealistic scenes to artistic styles like paintings and anime.
*   **Advanced Image Editing:** Perform sophisticated edits such as style transfer, object manipulation, detail enhancement, and even human pose adjustments.
*   **Image Understanding Capabilities:** Supports object detection, semantic segmentation, and more, enabling intelligent image editing.
*   **Multi-GPU API Server:** For local deployment, the server supports multi-GPU parallel processing and queue management.
*   **Community Support:** Extensive support from Hugging Face, ModelScope (DiffSynth-Studio, DiffSynth-Engine, and ModelScope AIGC Central), WaveSpeedAI, and LiblibAI.

### News

*   **2025.08.05:** Qwen-Image is now natively supported in ComfyUI.
*   **2025.08.05:** Qwen-Image is now on Qwen Chat.
*   **2025.08.05:** Technical Report released on Arxiv.
*   **2025.08.04:** Qwen-Image weights released on Hugging Face and Modelscope.
*   **2025.08.04:** Qwen-Image released.

> [!NOTE]
> The editing version of Qwen-Image will be released soon. Stay tuned!

### Quick Start

1.  Ensure you have transformers>=4.51.3 (Supporting Qwen2.5-VL)
2.  Install the latest version of diffusers:
    ```bash
    pip install git+https://github.com/huggingface/diffusers
    ```

**Example Code:**

```python
from diffusers import DiffusionPipeline
import torch

model_name = "Qwen/Qwen-Image"

# Load the pipeline
if torch.cuda.is_available():
    torch_dtype = torch.bfloat16
    device = "cuda"
else:
    torch_dtype = torch.float32
    device = "cpu"

pipe = DiffusionPipeline.from_pretrained(model_name, torch_dtype=torch_dtype)
pipe = pipe.to(device)

positive_magic = {
    "en": "Ultra HD, 4K, cinematic composition.", # for english prompt
    "zh": "Ë∂ÖÊ∏ÖÔºå4KÔºåÁîµÂΩ±Á∫ßÊûÑÂõæ" # for chinese prompt
}

# Generate image
prompt = '''A coffee shop entrance features a chalkboard sign reading "Qwen Coffee üòä $2 per cup," with a neon light beside it displaying "ÈÄö‰πâÂçÉÈóÆ". Next to it hangs a poster showing a beautiful Chinese woman, and beneath the poster is written "œÄ‚âà3.1415926-53589793-23846264-33832795-02384197".'''

negative_prompt = " " # Recommended if you don't use a negative prompt.


# Generate with different aspect ratios
aspect_ratios = {
    "1:1": (1328, 1328),
    "16:9": (1664, 928),
    "9:16": (928, 1664),
    "4:3": (1472, 1104),
    "3:4": (1104, 1472),
    "3:2": (1584, 1056),
    "2:3": (1056, 1584),
}

width, height = aspect_ratios["16:9"]

image = pipe(
    prompt=prompt + positive_magic["en"],
    negative_prompt=negative_prompt,
    width=width,
    height=height,
    num_inference_steps=50,
    true_cfg_scale=4.0,
    generator=torch.Generator(device="cuda").manual_seed(42)
).images[0]

image.save("example.png")
```

### Advanced Usage

#### Prompt Enhance

For enhanced prompt optimization and multi-language support, we recommend using our official Prompt Enhancement Tool powered by Qwen-Plus .

You can integrate it directly into your code:
```python
from tools.prompt_utils import rewrite
prompt = rewrite(prompt)
```

Alternatively, run the example script from the command line:

```bash
cd src
DASHSCOPE_API_KEY=sk-xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx python examples/generate_w_prompt_enhance.py
```

### Deploy Qwen-Image

Qwen-Image supports Multi-GPU API Server for local deployment:

### Multi-GPU API Server Pipeline & Usage

The Multi-GPU API Server will start a Gradio-based web interface with:
- Multi-GPU parallel processing
- Queue management for high concurrency
- Automatic prompt optimization
- Support for multiple aspect ratios

Configuration via environment variables:
```bash
export NUM_GPUS_TO_USE=4          # Number of GPUs to use
export TASK_QUEUE_SIZE=100        # Task queue size
export TASK_TIMEOUT=300           # Task timeout in seconds
```

```bash
# Start the gradio demo server, api key for prompt enhance
cd src
DASHSCOPE_API_KEY=sk-xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx python examples/demo.py 
```

### AI Arena

To comprehensively evaluate the general image generation capabilities of Qwen-Image and objectively compare it with state-of-the-art closed-source APIs, we introduce [AI Arena](https://aiarena.alibaba-inc.com), an open benchmarking platform built on the Elo rating system. AI Arena provides a fair, transparent, and dynamic environment for model evaluation.

In each round, two images‚Äîgenerated by randomly selected models from the same prompt‚Äîare anonymously presented to users for pairwise comparison. Users vote for the better image, and the results are used to update both personal and global leaderboards via the Elo algorithm, enabling developers, researchers, and the public to assess model performance in a robust and data-driven way. AI Arena is now publicly available, welcoming everyone to participate in model evaluations.

The latest leaderboard rankings can be viewed at [AI Arena Learboard](https://aiarena.alibaba-inc.com/corpora/arena/leaderboard?arenaType=text2image)

If you wish to deploy your model on AI Arena and participate in the evaluation, please contact weiyue.wy@alibaba-inc.com.
