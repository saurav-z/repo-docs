## Quick Start

Follow these steps to get started with Qwen-Image.

1.  **Prerequisites:** Make sure your transformers>=4.51.3 (Supporting Qwen2.5-VL)

2.  **Install Dependencies:**

    ```bash
    pip install git+https://github.com/huggingface/diffusers
    ```

### Text to Image

```python
from diffusers import DiffusionPipeline
import torch

model_name = "Qwen/Qwen-Image"

# Load the pipeline
if torch.cuda.is_available():
    torch_dtype = torch.bfloat16
    device = "cuda"
else:
    torch_dtype = torch.float32
    device = "cpu"

pipe = DiffusionPipeline.from_pretrained(model_name, torch_dtype=torch_dtype)
pipe = pipe.to(device)

positive_magic = {
    "en": ", Ultra HD, 4K, cinematic composition.", # for english prompt
    "zh": ", Ë∂ÖÊ∏ÖÔºå4KÔºåÁîµÂΩ±Á∫ßÊûÑÂõæ." # for chinese prompt
}

# Generate image
prompt = '''A coffee shop entrance features a chalkboard sign reading "Qwen Coffee üòä $2 per cup," with a neon light beside it displaying "ÈÄö‰πâÂçÉÈóÆ". Next to it hangs a poster showing a beautiful Chinese woman, and beneath the poster is written "œÄ‚âà3.1415926-53589793-23846264-33832795-02384197".'''

negative_prompt = " " # Recommended if you don't use a negative prompt.


# Generate with different aspect ratios
aspect_ratios = {
    "1:1": (1328, 1328),
    "16:9": (1664, 928),
    "9:16": (928, 1664),
    "4:3": (1472, 1104),
    "3:4": (1104, 1472),
    "3:2": (1584, 1056),
    "2:3": (1056, 1584),
}

width, height = aspect_ratios["16:9"]

image = pipe(
    prompt=prompt + positive_magic["en"],
    negative_prompt=negative_prompt,
    width=width,
    height=height,
    num_inference_steps=50,
    true_cfg_scale=4.0,
    generator=torch.Generator(device="cuda").manual_seed(42)
).images[0]

image.save("example.png")
```

### Image Editing

```python
import os
from PIL import Image
import torch

from diffusers import QwenImageEditPipeline

pipeline = QwenImageEditPipeline.from_pretrained("Qwen/Qwen-Image-Edit")
print("pipeline loaded")
pipeline.to(torch.bfloat16)
pipeline.to("cuda")
pipeline.set_progress_bar_config(disable=None)

image = Image.open("./input.png").convert("RGB")
prompt = "Change the rabbit's color to purple, with a flash light background."


inputs = {
    "image": image,
    "prompt": prompt,
    "generator": torch.manual_seed(0),
    "true_cfg_scale": 4.0,
    "negative_prompt": " ",
    "num_inference_steps": 50,
}

with torch.inference_mode():
    output = pipeline(**inputs)
    output_image = output.images[0]
    output_image.save("output_image_edit.png")
    print("image saved at", os.path.abspath("output_image_edit.png"))
```

## Advanced Usage

### Prompt Enhancement

*   For enhanced prompt optimization and multi-language support, use our official Prompt Enhancement Tool powered by Qwen-Plus. Integrate directly in your code:

    ```python
    from tools.prompt_utils import rewrite
    prompt = rewrite(prompt)
    ```
*   For enhanced stability, use our official Prompt Enhancement Tool powered by Qwen-VL-Max for image editing:

    ```python
    from tools.prompt_utils import polish_edit_prompt
    prompt = polish_edit_prompt(prompt, pil_image)
    ```

## Deploy Qwen-Image

Qwen-Image supports Multi-GPU API Server for local deployment.

### Multi-GPU API Server Pipeline & Usage

The Multi-GPU API Server will start a Gradio-based web interface with:

*   Multi-GPU parallel processing
*   Queue management for high concurrency
*   Automatic prompt optimization
*   Support for multiple aspect ratios

Configuration via environment variables:

```bash
export NUM_GPUS_TO_USE=4          # Number of GPUs to use
export TASK_QUEUE_SIZE=100        # Task queue size
export TASK_TIMEOUT=300           # Task timeout in seconds
```

```bash
# Start the gradio demo server, api key for prompt enhance
cd src
DASHSCOPE_API_KEY=sk-xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx python examples/demo.py
```

## Show Cases

### General Cases

One of its standout capabilities is high-fidelity text rendering across diverse images. Whether it's alphabetic languages like English or logographic scripts like Chinese, Qwen-Image preserves typographic details, layout coherence, and contextual harmony with stunning accuracy. Text isn't just overlaid, it's seamlessly integrated into the visual fabric.

![](https://qianwen-res.oss-cn-beijing.aliyuncs.com/Qwen-Image/s1.jpg#center)

Beyond text, Qwen-Image excels at general image generation with support for a wide range of artistic styles. From photorealistic scenes to impressionist paintings, from anime aesthetics to minimalist design, the model adapts fluidly to creative prompts, making it a versatile tool for artists, designers, and storytellers.

![](https://qianwen-res.oss-cn-beijing.aliyuncs.com/Qwen-Image/s2.jpg#center)

When it comes to image editing, Qwen-Image goes far beyond simple adjustments. It enables advanced operations such as style transfer, object insertion or removal, detail enhancement, text editing within images, and even human pose manipulation‚Äîall with intuitive input and coherent output. This level of control brings professional-grade editing within reach of everyday users.

![](https://qianwen-res.oss-cn-beijing.aliyuncs.com/Qwen-Image/s3.jpg#center)

But Qwen-Image doesn't just create or edit, it understands. It supports a suite of image understanding tasks, including object detection, semantic segmentation, depth and edge (Canny) estimation, novel view synthesis, and super-resolution. These capabilities, while technically distinct, can all be seen as specialized forms of intelligent image editing, powered by deep visual comprehension.

![](https://qianwen-res.oss-cn-beijing.aliyuncs.com/Qwen-Image/s4.jpg#center)

Together, these features make Qwen-Image not just a tool for generating pretty pictures, but a comprehensive foundation model for intelligent visual creation and manipulation‚Äîwhere language, layout, and imagery converge.

### Tutorial for Image Editing

## AI Arena

To comprehensively evaluate the general image generation capabilities of Qwen-Image and objectively compare it with state-of-the-art closed-source APIs, we introduce [AI Arena](https://aiarena.alibaba-inc.com), an open benchmarking platform built on the Elo rating system. AI Arena provides a fair, transparent, and dynamic environment for model evaluation.

In each round, two images‚Äîgenerated by randomly selected models from the same prompt‚Äîare anonymously presented to users for pairwise comparison. Users vote for the better image, and the results are used to update both personal and global leaderboards via the Elo algorithm, enabling developers, researchers, and the public to assess model performance in a robust and data-driven way. AI Arena is now publicly available, welcoming everyone to participate in model evaluations.
