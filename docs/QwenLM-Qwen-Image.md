# Qwen-Image: Unleash the Power of Advanced Text-to-Image Generation and Editing

**Qwen-Image is a cutting-edge 20B MMDiT model that excels at generating stunning images from text prompts and provides powerful image editing capabilities.** ([Original Repository](https://github.com/QwenLM/Qwen-Image))

## Key Features

*   **Exceptional Text Rendering:** Achieve unparalleled accuracy in rendering complex text within images, including support for both English and Chinese.
*   **Versatile Image Generation:** Generate diverse and high-quality images across various artistic styles, including photorealistic, anime, and more.
*   **Advanced Image Editing:** Edit images with precision, including style transfer, object manipulation (insertion, removal), detail enhancement, and text editing.
*   **Image Understanding Capabilities:** Leverage built-in features for object detection, semantic segmentation, and other intelligent image manipulation tasks.
*   **Seamless Integration:** Integrate easily with existing tools and platforms, including ComfyUI and Qwen Chat.
*   **Open Source & Accessible:** Benefit from open-source availability and easy access through Hugging Face and ModelScope.

## Quick Start

### Installation

1.  Ensure you have `transformers>=4.51.3` installed (supports Qwen2.5-VL).
2.  Install the latest version of `diffusers`:
    ```bash
    pip install git+https://github.com/huggingface/diffusers
    ```

### Text-to-Image Example

```python
from diffusers import DiffusionPipeline
import torch

model_name = "Qwen/Qwen-Image"

# Load the pipeline
if torch.cuda.is_available():
    torch_dtype = torch.bfloat16
    device = "cuda"
else:
    torch_dtype = torch.float32
    device = "cpu"

pipe = DiffusionPipeline.from_pretrained(model_name, torch_dtype=torch_dtype)
pipe = pipe.to(device)

positive_magic = {
    "en": ", Ultra HD, 4K, cinematic composition.", # for english prompt
    "zh": ", Ë∂ÖÊ∏ÖÔºå4KÔºåÁîµÂΩ±Á∫ßÊûÑÂõæ." # for chinese prompt
}

# Generate image
prompt = '''A coffee shop entrance features a chalkboard sign reading "Qwen Coffee üòä $2 per cup," with a neon light beside it displaying "ÈÄö‰πâÂçÉÈóÆ". Next to it hangs a poster showing a beautiful Chinese woman, and beneath the poster is written "œÄ‚âà3.1415926-53589793-23846264-33832795-02384197".'''

negative_prompt = " " # Recommended if you don't use a negative prompt.


# Generate with different aspect ratios
aspect_ratios = {
    "1:1": (1328, 1328),
    "16:9": (1664, 928),
    "9:16": (928, 1664),
    "4:3": (1472, 1104),
    "3:4": (1104, 1472),
    "3:2": (1584, 1056),
    "2:3": (1056, 1584),
}

width, height = aspect_ratios["16:9"]

image = pipe(
    prompt=prompt + positive_magic["en"],
    negative_prompt=negative_prompt,
    width=width,
    height=height,
    num_inference_steps=50,
    true_cfg_scale=4.0,
    generator=torch.Generator(device="cuda").manual_seed(42)
).images[0]

image.save("example.png")
```

### Image Editing Example

```python
import os
from PIL import Image
import torch

from diffusers import QwenImageEditPipeline

pipeline = QwenImageEditPipeline.from_pretrained("Qwen/Qwen-Image-Edit")
print("pipeline loaded")
pipeline.to(torch.bfloat16)
pipeline.to("cuda")
pipeline.set_progress_bar_config(disable=None)

image = Image.open("./input.png").convert("RGB")
prompt = "Change the rabbit's color to purple, with a flash light background."


inputs = {
    "image": image,
    "prompt": prompt,
    "generator": torch.manual_seed(0),
    "true_cfg_scale": 4.0,
    "negative_prompt": " ",
    "num_inference_steps": 50,
}

with torch.inference_mode():
    output = pipeline(**inputs)
    output_image = output.images[0]
    output_image.save("output_image_edit.png")
    print("image saved at", os.path.abspath("output_image_edit.png"))
```

## Advanced Usage

### Prompt Enhancement

For enhanced prompt optimization and multi-language support, use our Prompt Enhancement Tool powered by Qwen-Plus:
```python
from tools.prompt_utils import rewrite
prompt = rewrite(prompt)
```

Alternatively, from the command line:
```bash
cd src
DASHSCOPE_API_KEY=sk-xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx python examples/generate_w_prompt_enhance.py
```

## Deploy Qwen-Image

Qwen-Image supports Multi-GPU API Server for local deployment:

### Multi-GPU API Server Pipeline & Usage

The Multi-GPU API Server will start a Gradio-based web interface with:
- Multi-GPU parallel processing
- Queue management for high concurrency
- Automatic prompt optimization
- Support for multiple aspect ratios

Configuration via environment variables:
```bash
export NUM_GPUS_TO_USE=4          # Number of GPUs to use
export TASK_QUEUE_SIZE=100        # Task queue size
export TASK_TIMEOUT=300           # Task timeout in seconds
```

```bash
# Start the gradio demo server, api key for prompt enhance
cd src
DASHSCOPE_API_KEY=sk-xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx python examples/demo.py 
```
