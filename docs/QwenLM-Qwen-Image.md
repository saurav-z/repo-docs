## Quick Start

### Prerequisites

*   `transformers>=4.51.3` (Supporting Qwen2.5-VL)
*   Latest version of `diffusers`

```bash
pip install git+https://github.com/huggingface/diffusers
```

### Text to Image

```python
from diffusers import DiffusionPipeline
import torch

model_name = "Qwen/Qwen-Image"

# Load the pipeline
if torch.cuda.is_available():
    torch_dtype = torch.bfloat16
    device = "cuda"
else:
    torch_dtype = torch.float32
    device = "cpu"

pipe = DiffusionPipeline.from_pretrained(model_name, torch_dtype=torch_dtype)
pipe = pipe.to(device)

positive_magic = {
    "en": ", Ultra HD, 4K, cinematic composition.", # for english prompt
    "zh": ", Ë∂ÖÊ∏ÖÔºå4KÔºåÁîµÂΩ±Á∫ßÊûÑÂõæ." # for chinese prompt
}

# Generate image
prompt = '''A coffee shop entrance features a chalkboard sign reading "Qwen Coffee üòä $2 per cup," with a neon light beside it displaying "ÈÄö‰πâÂçÉÈóÆ". Next to it hangs a poster showing a beautiful Chinese woman, and beneath the poster is written "œÄ‚âà3.1415926-53589793-23846264-33832795-02384197".'''

negative_prompt = " " # Recommended if you don't use a negative prompt.


# Generate with different aspect ratios
aspect_ratios = {
    "1:1": (1328, 1328),
    "16:9": (1664, 928),
    "9:16": (928, 1664),
    "4:3": (1472, 1104),
    "3:4": (1104, 1472),
    "3:2": (1584, 1056),
    "2:3": (1056, 1584),
}

width, height = aspect_ratios["16:9"]

image = pipe(
    prompt=prompt + positive_magic["en"],
    negative_prompt=negative_prompt,
    width=width,
    height=height,
    num_inference_steps=50,
    true_cfg_scale=4.0,
    generator=torch.Generator(device="cuda").manual_seed(42)
).images[0]

image.save("example.png")
```

### Image Editing

```python
import os
from PIL import Image
import torch

from diffusers import QwenImageEditPipeline

pipeline = QwenImageEditPipeline.from_pretrained("Qwen/Qwen-Image-Edit")
print("pipeline loaded")
pipeline.to(torch.bfloat16)
pipeline.to("cuda")
pipeline.set_progress_bar_config(disable=None)

image = Image.open("./input.png").convert("RGB")
prompt = "Change the rabbit's color to purple, with a flash light background."


inputs = {
    "image": image,
    "prompt": prompt,
    "generator": torch.manual_seed(0),
    "true_cfg_scale": 4.0,
    "negative_prompt": " ",
    "num_inference_steps": 50,
}

with torch.inference_mode():
    output = pipeline(**inputs)
    output_image = output.images[0]
    output_image.save("output_image_edit.png")
    print("image saved at", os.path.abspath("output_image_edit.png"))
```

> [!NOTE]
> For stable editing results, we strongly recommend using prompt rewriting. Refer to the [demo script](src/examples/tools/prompt_utils.py) or Advanced Usage.

### Advanced Usage

#### Prompt Enhancement

*   **Text-to-Image:**  Use the prompt enhancement tool powered by Qwen-Plus for improved prompt optimization and multi-language support:
    ```python
    from tools.prompt_utils import rewrite
    prompt = rewrite(prompt)
    ```

    Or, run the example script:
    ```bash
    cd src
    DASHSCOPE_API_KEY=sk-xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx python examples/generate_w_prompt_enhance.py
    ```

*   **Image Edit:** Utilize the prompt enhancement tool powered by Qwen-VL-Max for enhanced stability:

    ```python
    from tools.prompt_utils import polish_edit_prompt
    prompt = polish_edit_prompt(prompt, pil_image)
    ```

## Deploy Qwen-Image

### Multi-GPU API Server

Qwen-Image supports a Multi-GPU API Server with a Gradio-based web interface.

*   **Features:** Multi-GPU parallel processing, queue management, automatic prompt optimization, and multiple aspect ratio support.

*   **Configuration:**

    ```bash
    export NUM_GPUS_TO_USE=4          # Number of GPUs to use
    export TASK_QUEUE_SIZE=100        # Task queue size
    export TASK_TIMEOUT=300           # Task timeout in seconds
    ```

*   **Run the demo server:**

    ```bash
    cd src
    DASHSCOPE_API_KEY=sk-xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx python examples/demo.py
    ```

## Show Cases
