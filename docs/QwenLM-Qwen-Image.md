## Quick Start

1.  Make sure your transformers>=4.51.3 (Supporting Qwen2.5-VL)

2.  Install the latest version of diffusers
    ```
    pip install git+https://github.com/huggingface/diffusers
    ```

### Text to Image

The following contains a code snippet illustrating how to use the model to generate images based on text prompts:

```python
from diffusers import DiffusionPipeline
import torch

model_name = "Qwen/Qwen-Image"

# Load the pipeline
if torch.cuda.is_available():
    torch_dtype = torch.bfloat16
    device = "cuda"
else:
    torch_dtype = torch.float32
    device = "cpu"

pipe = DiffusionPipeline.from_pretrained(model_name, torch_dtype=torch_dtype)
pipe = pipe.to(device)

positive_magic = {
    "en": ", Ultra HD, 4K, cinematic composition.", # for english prompt
    "zh": ", Ë∂ÖÊ∏ÖÔºå4KÔºåÁîµÂΩ±Á∫ßÊûÑÂõæ." # for chinese prompt
}

# Generate image
prompt = '''A coffee shop entrance features a chalkboard sign reading "Qwen Coffee üòä $2 per cup," with a neon light beside it displaying "ÈÄö‰πâÂçÉÈóÆ". Next to it hangs a poster showing a beautiful Chinese woman, and beneath the poster is written "œÄ‚âà3.1415926-53589793-23846264-33832795-02384197".'''

negative_prompt = " " # Recommended if you don't use a negative prompt.


# Generate with different aspect ratios
aspect_ratios = {
    "1:1": (1328, 1328),
    "16:9": (1664, 928),
    "9:16": (928, 1664),
    "4:3": (1472, 1104),
    "3:2": (1584, 1056),
    "2:3": (1056, 1584),
}

width, height = aspect_ratios["16:9"]

image = pipe(
    prompt=prompt + positive_magic["en"],
    negative_prompt=negative_prompt,
    width=width,
    height=height,
    num_inference_steps=50,
    true_cfg_scale=4.0,
    generator=torch.Generator(device="cuda").manual_seed(42)
).images[0]

image.save("example.png")
```

### Image Editing

```python
import os
from PIL import Image
import torch

from diffusers import QwenImageEditPipeline

pipeline = QwenImageEditPipeline.from_pretrained("Qwen/Qwen-Image-Edit")
print("pipeline loaded")
pipeline.to(torch.bfloat16)
pipeline.to("cuda")
pipeline.set_progress_bar_config(disable=None)

image = Image.open("./input.png").convert("RGB")
prompt = "Change the rabbit's color to purple, with a flash light background."


inputs = {
    "image": image,
    "prompt": prompt,
    "generator": torch.manual_seed(0),
    "true_cfg_scale": 4.0,
    "negative_prompt": " ",
    "num_inference_steps": 50,
}

with torch.inference_mode():
    output = pipeline(**inputs)
    output_image = output.images[0]
    output_image.save("output_image_edit.png")
    print("image saved at", os.path.abspath("output_image_edit.png"))
```

> [!NOTE]
> We highly recommend using prompt rewriting to improve the stability of editing cases. For reference, please see our official [demo script](src/examples/edit_demo.py), which includes example system prompts. Qwen-Image-Edit is actively evolving with ongoing development. Stay tuned for future enhancements!

## Show Cases

### General Cases

One of its standout capabilities is high-fidelity text rendering across diverse images. Whether it's alphabetic languages like English or logographic scripts like Chinese, Qwen-Image preserves typographic details, layout coherence, and contextual harmony with stunning accuracy. Text isn't just overlaid, it's seamlessly integrated into the visual fabric.

<p align="center">
    <img src="https://qianwen-res.oss-cn-beijing.aliyuncs.com/Qwen-Image/s1.jpg#center" width="600"/>
</p>

Beyond text, Qwen-Image excels at general image generation with support for a wide range of artistic styles. From photorealistic scenes to impressionist paintings, from anime aesthetics to minimalist design, the model adapts fluidly to creative prompts, making it a versatile tool for artists, designers, and storytellers.

<p align="center">
    <img src="https://qianwen-res.oss-cn-beijing.aliyuncs.com/Qwen-Image/s2.jpg#center" width="600"/>
</p>

When it comes to image editing, Qwen-Image goes far beyond simple adjustments. It enables advanced operations such as style transfer, object insertion or removal, detail enhancement, text editing within images, and even human pose manipulation‚Äîall with intuitive input and coherent output. This level of control brings professional-grade editing within reach of everyday users.

<p align="center">
    <img src="https://qianwen-res.oss-cn-beijing.aliyuncs.com/Qwen-Image/s3.jpg#center" width="600"/>
</p>

But Qwen-Image doesn't just create or edit, it understands. It supports a suite of image understanding tasks, including object detection, semantic segmentation, depth and edge (Canny) estimation, novel view synthesis, and super-resolution. These capabilities, while technically distinct, can all be seen as specialized forms of intelligent image editing, powered by deep visual comprehension.

<p align="center">
    <img src="https://qianwen-res.oss-cn-beijing.aliyuncs.com/Qwen-Image/s4.jpg#center" width="600"/>
</p>

Together, these features make Qwen-Image not just a tool for generating pretty pictures, but a comprehensive foundation model for intelligent visual creation and manipulation‚Äîwhere language, layout, and imagery converge.

### Tutorial for Image Editing

One of the highlights of Qwen-Image-Edit lies in its powerful capabilities for semantic and appearance editing. Semantic editing refers to modifying image content while preserving the original visual semantics. To intuitively demonstrate this capability, let's take Qwen's mascot‚ÄîCapybara‚Äîas an example:
<p align="center">
    <img src="https://qianwen-res.oss-cn-beijing.aliyuncs.com/Qwen-Image/edit_en/ÂπªÁÅØÁâá3.JPG#center" width="400"/>
</p>
As can be seen, although most pixels in the edited image differ from those in the input image (the leftmost image), the character consistency of Capybara is perfectly preserved. Qwen-Image-Edit's powerful semantic editing capability enables effortless and diverse creation of original IP content.
Furthermore, on Qwen Chat, we designed a series of editing prompts centered around the 16 MBTI personality types. Leveraging these prompts, we successfully created a set of MBTI-themed emoji packs based on our mascot Capybara, effortlessly expanding the IP's reach and expression.
<p align="center">
    <img src="https://qianwen-res.oss-cn-beijing.aliyuncs.com/Qwen-Image/edit_en/ÂπªÁÅØÁâá4.JPG#center" width="400"/>
</p>
Moreover, novel view synthesis is another key application scenario in semantic editing. As shown in the two example images below, Qwen-Image-Edit can not only rotate objects by 90 degrees, but also perform a full 180-degree rotation, allowing us to directly see the back side of the object:
<p align="center">
    <img src="https://qianwen-res.oss-cn-beijing.aliyuncs.com/Qwen-Image/edit_en/ÂπªÁÅØÁâá12.JPG#center" width="400"/>
</p>
<p align="center">
    <img src="https://qianwen-res.oss-cn-beijing.aliyuncs.com/Qwen-Image/edit_en/ÂπªÁÅØÁâá13.JPG#center" width="400"/>
</p>
Another typical application of semantic editing is style transfer. For instance, given an input portrait, Qwen-Image-Edit can easily transform it into various artistic styles such as Studio Ghibli. This capability holds significant value in applications like virtual avatar creation:
<p align="center">
    <img src="https://qianwen-res.oss-cn-beijing.aliyuncs.com/Qwen-Image/edit_en/ÂπªÁÅØÁâá1.JPG#center" width="400"/>
</p>
In addition to semantic editing, appearance editing is another common image editing requirement. Appearance editing emphasizes keeping certain regions of the image completely unchanged while adding, removing, or modifying specific elements. The image below illustrates a case where a signboard is added to the scene.
As shown, Qwen-Image-Edit not only successfully inserts the signboard but also generates a corresponding reflection, demonstrating exceptional attention to detail.
<p align="center">
    <img src="https://qianwen-res.oss-cn-beijing.aliyuncs.com/Qwen-Image/edit_en/ÂπªÁÅØÁâá6.JPG#center" width="400"/>
</p>
Below is another interesting example, demonstrating how to remove fine hair strands and other small objects from an image.
<p align="center">
    <img src="https://qianwen-res.oss-cn-beijing.aliyuncs.com/Qwen-Image/edit_en/ÂπªÁÅØÁâá7.JPG#center" width="400"/>
</p>
Additionally, the color of a specific letter "n" in the image can be modified to blue, enabling precise editing of particular elements.
<p align="center">
    <img src="https://qianwen-res.oss-cn-beijing.aliyuncs.com/Qwen-Image/edit_en/ÂπªÁÅØÁâá8.JPG#center" width="400"/>
</p>
Appearance editing also has wide-ranging applications in scenarios such as adjusting a person's background or changing clothing. The three images below demonstrate these practical use cases respectively.
<p align="center">
    <img src="https://qianwen-res.oss-cn-beijing.aliyuncs.com/Qwen-Image/edit_en/ÂπªÁÅØÁâá11.JPG#center" width="400"/>
</p>
<p align="center">
    <img src="https://qianwen-res.oss-cn-beijing.aliyuncs.com/Qwen-Image/edit_en/ÂπªÁÅØÁâá5.JPG#center" width="400"/>
</p>
Another standout feature of Qwen-Image-Edit is its accurate text editing capability, which stems from Qwen-Image's deep expertise in text rendering. As shown below, the following two cases vividly demonstrate Qwen-Image-Edit's powerful performance in editing English text:
<p align="center">
    <img src="https://qianwen-res.oss-cn-beijing.aliyuncs.com/Qwen-Image/edit_en/ÂπªÁÅØÁâá15.JPG#center" width="400"/>
</p>
<p align="center">
    <img src="https://qianwen-res.oss-cn-beijing.aliyuncs.com/Qwen-Image/edit_en/ÂπªÁÅØÁâá16.JPG#center" width="400"/>
</p>
Qwen-Image-Edit can also directly edit Chinese posters, enabling not only modifications to large headline text but also precise adjustments to even small and intricate text elements.
<p align="center">
    <img src="https://qianwen-res.oss-cn-beijing.aliyuncs.com/Qwen-Image/edit_en/ÂπªÁÅØÁâá17.JPG#center" width="400"/>
</p>
Finally, let's walk through a concrete image editing example to demonstrate how to use a chained editing approach to progressively correct errors in a calligraphy artwork generated by Qwen-Image:
<p align="center">
    <img src="https://qianwen-res.oss-cn-beijing.aliyuncs.com/Qwen-Image/edit_en/ÂπªÁÅØÁâá18.JPG#center" width="400"/>
</p>
In this artwork, several Chinese characters contain generation errors. We can leverage Qwen-Image-Edit to correct them step by step. For instance, we can draw bounding boxes on the original image to mark the regions that need correction, instructing Qwen-Image-Edit to fix these specific areas. Here, we want the character "Á®Ω" to be correctly written within the red box, and the character "‰∫≠" to be accurately rendered in the blue region.
<p align="center">
    <img src="https://qianwen-res.oss-cn-beijing.aliyuncs.com/Qwen-Image/edit_en/ÂπªÁÅØÁâá19.JPG#center" width="400"/>
</p>
However, in practice, the character "Á®Ω" is relatively obscure, and the model fails to correct it correctly in one step. The lower-right component of "Á®Ω" should be "Êó®" rather than "Êó•". At this point, we can further highlight the "Êó•" portion with a red box, instructing Qwen-Image-Edit to fine-tune this detail and replace it with "Êó®".
<p align="center">
    <img src="https://qianwen-res.oss-cn-beijing.aliyuncs.com/Qwen-Image/edit_en/ÂπªÁÅØÁâá20.JPG#center" width="400"/>
</p>
Isn't it amazing? With this chained, step-by-step editing approach, we can continuously correct character errors until the desired final result is achieved.
<p align="center">
    <img src="https://qianwen-res.oss-cn-beijing.aliyuncs.com/Qwen-Image/edit_en/ÂπªÁÅØÁâá21.JPG#center" width="400"/>
</p>
<p align="center">
    <img src="https://qianwen-res.oss-cn-beijing.aliyuncs.com/Qwen-Image/edit_en/ÂπªÁÅØÁâá22.JPG#center" width="400"/>
</p>
<p align="center">
    <img src="https://qianwen-res.oss-cn-beijing.aliyuncs.com/Qwen-Image/edit_en/ÂπªÁÅØÁâá23.JPG#center" width="400"/>
</p>
<p align="center">
    <img src="https://qianwen-res.oss-cn-beijing.aliyuncs.com/Qwen-Image/edit_en/ÂπªÁÅØÁâá24.JPG#center" width="400"/>
</p>
<p align="center">
    <img src="https://qianwen-res.oss-cn-beijing.aliyuncs.com/Qwen-Image/edit_en/ÂπªÁÅØÁâá25.JPG#center" width="400"/>
</p>
Finally, we have successfully obtained a completely correct calligraphy version of *Lantingji Xu (Orchid Pavilion Preface)*!
In summary, we hope that Qwen-Image-Edit can further advance the field of image generation, truly lower the technical barriers to visual content creation, and inspire even more innovative applications.
