## Quick Start

1.  Make sure your transformers>=4.51.3 (Supporting Qwen2.5-VL)

2.  Install the latest version of diffusers

    ```bash
    pip install git+https://github.com/huggingface/diffusers
    ```

    The following contains a code snippet illustrating how to use the model to generate images based on text prompts:

    ```python
    from diffusers import DiffusionPipeline
    import torch

    model_name = "Qwen/Qwen-Image"

    # Load the pipeline
    if torch.cuda.is_available():
        torch_dtype = torch.bfloat16
        device = "cuda"
    else:
        torch_dtype = torch.float32
        device = "cpu"

    pipe = DiffusionPipeline.from_pretrained(model_name, torch_dtype=torch_dtype)
    pipe = pipe.to(device)

    positive_magic = {
        "en": "Ultra HD, 4K, cinematic composition.", # for english prompt
        "zh": "Ë∂ÖÊ∏ÖÔºå4KÔºåÁîµÂΩ±Á∫ßÊûÑÂõæ" # for chinese prompt
    }

    # Generate image
    prompt = '''A coffee shop entrance features a chalkboard sign reading "Qwen Coffee üòä $2 per cup," with a neon light beside it displaying "ÈÄö‰πâÂçÉÈóÆ". Next to it hangs a poster showing a beautiful Chinese woman, and beneath the poster is written "œÄ‚âà3.1415926-53589793-23846264-33832795-02384197".'''

    negative_prompt = " " # Recommended if you don't use a negative prompt.


    # Generate with different aspect ratios
    aspect_ratios = {
        "1:1": (1328, 1328),
        "16:9": (1664, 928),
        "9:16": (928, 1664),
        "4:3": (1472, 1104),
        "3:4": (1104, 1472),
        "3:2": (1584, 1056),
        "2:3": (1056, 1584),
    }

    width, height = aspect_ratios["16:9"]

    image = pipe(
        prompt=prompt + positive_magic["en"],
        negative_prompt=negative_prompt,
        width=width,
        height=height,
        num_inference_steps=50,
        true_cfg_scale=4.0,
        generator=torch.Generator(device="cuda").manual_seed(42)
    ).images[0]

    image.save("example.png")
    ```

```python
from tools.prompt_utils import rewrite
prompt = rewrite(prompt)
```

Alternatively, run the example script:

```bash
cd src
DASHSCOPE_API_KEY=sk-xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx python examples/generate_w_prompt_enhance.py
```

## Deploy Qwen-Image

Qwen-Image supports a Multi-GPU API Server for local deployment.

### Multi-GPU API Server Pipeline & Usage

The Multi-GPU API Server offers:

*   Multi-GPU parallel processing
*   Queue management for high concurrency
*   Automatic prompt optimization
*   Support for multiple aspect ratios

Configuration via environment variables:

```bash
export NUM_GPUS_TO_USE=4          # Number of GPUs to use
export TASK_QUEUE_SIZE=100        # Task queue size
export TASK_TIMEOUT=300           # Task timeout in seconds
```

```bash
# Start the gradio demo server, api key for prompt enhance
cd src
DASHSCOPE_API_KEY=sk-xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx python examples/demo.py
```
