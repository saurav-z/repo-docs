## Getting Started

*   **Desktop Application:** The easiest way to get started, available for Windows & macOS: [Download](https://www.comfy.org/download)
*   **Windows Portable Package:** Get the latest commits and enjoy complete portability (Windows only).
*   **Manual Install:** Supports all operating systems and GPU types (NVIDIA, AMD, Intel, Apple Silicon, Ascend).

## Installation

### Windows Portable

Download, extract with [7-Zip](https://7-zip.org), and run. Place Stable Diffusion checkpoints/models in `ComfyUI\models\checkpoints`.

[Direct download link](https://github.com/comfyanonymous/ComfyUI/releases/latest/download/ComfyUI_windows_portable_nvidia.7z)

### comfy-cli
```bash
pip install comfy-cli
comfy install
```
### Manual Install (Windows, Linux)

1.  **Clone the Repository:** `git clone this repo`
2.  **Model Placement:** Place your SD checkpoints (ckpt/safetensors) in `models/checkpoints` and VAEs in `models/vae`.
3.  **Install Dependencies:** `pip install -r requirements.txt` within the ComfyUI directory.
4.  **Run ComfyUI:** `python main.py`

### Platform-Specific Instructions:

*   **AMD GPUs (Linux):** Install ROCm and PyTorch.
    ```bash
    pip install torch torchvision torchaudio --index-url https://download.pytorch.org/whl/rocm6.4
    ```
*   **Intel GPUs:** Instructions for using native PyTorch xpu and Intel Extension for PyTorch (IPEX).
    ```bash
    pip install torch torchvision torchaudio --index-url https://download.pytorch.org/whl/xpu
    ```
*   **NVIDIA GPUs:** Install PyTorch with CUDA support:
    ```bash
    pip install torch torchvision torchaudio --extra-index-url https://download.pytorch.org/whl/cu129
    ```
*   **Apple Mac silicon:** [Apple Developer Guide](https://developer.apple.com/metal/pytorch/) (make sure to install the latest pytorch nightly)
*   **DirectML (AMD Cards on Windows):** Very badly supported and is not recommended.
    ```bash
    pip install torch-directml
    python main.py --directml
    ```
*   **Ascend NPUs** [installation](https://ascend.github.io/docs/sources/ascend/quick_install.html)
*   **Cambricon MLUs** [Installation](https://www.cambricon.com/docs/sdk_1.15.0/cntoolkit_3.7.2/cntoolkit_install_3.7.2/index.html)
*   **Iluvatar Corex** [Installation](https://support.iluvatar.com/#/DocumentCentre?id=1&nameCenter=2&productId=520117912052801536)

### Troubleshooting

*   If you get the "Torch not compiled with CUDA enabled" error, reinstall PyTorch.
*   For AMD cards not officially supported by ROCm and for AMD ROCm tips see the original README.

## Running

Run ComfyUI with the command: `python main.py`

## Essential Shortcuts

A comprehensive list of keyboard shortcuts can be found within the original [README](https://github.com/comfyanonymous/ComfyUI).

## Configuration and Customization

*   **Config File:** Use `extra_model_paths.yaml.example` (renamed to `extra_model_paths.yaml`) to specify custom model search paths.

## How to show high-quality previews?

To enable higher-quality previews with TAESD, download `taesd_decoder.pth, taesdxl_decoder.pth, taesd3_decoder.pth and taef1_decoder.pth` and place them in the `models/vae_approx` folder. Then restart ComfyUI and launch it with `--preview-method taesd`.

## How to use TLS/SSL?

Generate self-signed certificates and use `--tls-keyfile key.pem --tls-certfile cert.pem` to enable TLS/SSL.

## Support and Community

*   **Discord:** Join the community on Discord for help and feedback: [Discord](https://www.comfy.org/discord)
