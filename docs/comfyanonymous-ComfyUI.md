ComfyUI is a powerful and modular visual AI engine and application that allows users to design and execute advanced Stable Diffusion pipelines. It utilizes a graph/nodes/flowchart based interface, providing a flexible and intuitive way to experiment with and create complex AI workflows. It is available on Windows, Linux, and macOS.

## Key Features

*   **Node-Based Workflow:** Design complex Stable Diffusion pipelines without coding using an intuitive node-based interface.
*   **Model Support:** Extensive support for a wide range of image, video, and audio models, including:
    *   **Image Models:** SD1.x, SD2.x, SDXL, SDXL Turbo, Stable Cascade, SD3 and SD3.5, Pixart Alpha and Sigma, AuraFlow, HunyuanDiT, Flux, Lumina Image 2.0, HiDream, Qwen Image, and Hunyuan Image 2.1.
    *   **Image Editing Models:** Omnigen 2, Flux Kontext, HiDream E1.1, Qwen Image Edit.
    *   **Video Models:** Stable Video Diffusion, Mochi, LTX-Video, Hunyuan Video, Wan 2.1, and Wan 2.2.
    *   **Audio Models:** Stable Audio and ACE Step.
    *   **3D Models:** Hunyuan3D 2.0.
*   **Optimized Performance:**  Features asynchronous queue system, memory optimization for low-VRAM GPUs, and only re-executes modified parts of the workflow.
*   **Checkpoint and Model Loading:** Supports loading ckpt and safetensors files, including diffusion models, VAEs, and CLIP models.
*   **Advanced Features:** Includes support for embeddings/textual inversions, LoRAs, Hypernetworks, area composition, inpainting, ControlNet/T2I-Adapter, and upscale models.
*   **Workflow Management:** Load and save workflows as JSON files; load workflows from generated PNG, WebP, and FLAC files.
*   **Offline Functionality:** Works fully offline, ensuring privacy and control over your AI workflows.
*   **API Integration:** Optional API nodes available to use paid models from external providers via the Comfy API.
