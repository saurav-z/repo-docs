**Tired of squinting at blurry comics on your e-reader?** Kindle Comic Converter (KCC) is a powerful, free tool designed to convert and optimize your favorite manga and comics for e-ink devices like Kindle, Kobo, and reMarkable, ensuring a crisp, full-screen reading experience.  [Check out the latest release!](https://github.com/ciromattia/kcc/releases)

## Key Features:

*   **Versatile Input:** Supports JPG, PNG, GIF, and PDF files (including DRM-free PDFs from sources like Kodansha/Humble Bundle).
*   **Multiple Output Formats:** Create optimized files in MOBI/AZW3 (Kindle), EPUB, KEPUB (Kobo), CBZ, and PDF formats.  PDF output is perfect for reMarkable devices!
*   **E-ink Optimization:**  Advanced image processing to enhance contrast and reduce file size, improving readability, battery life, and performance on e-readers.
*   **Fixed Layout Support:**  Ensures proper display of comics and manga with accurate page layouts.

*   **GUI and CLI versions** Both a graphical user interface (GUI) and command-line interface (CLI) are available.

## Why Choose KCC?

KCC goes beyond simple conversion.  It addresses common formatting issues found even in the Kindle Store, such as:

*   Faded black levels, reducing contrast and causing eye strain.
*   Unnecessary margins that shrink the reading area.
*   Incorrect page turn directions for manga.
*   Misaligned two-page spreads.
