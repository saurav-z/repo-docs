KCC addresses common formatting issues found in digital comics, such as faded blacks, unnecessary margins, and incorrect page orientations, leading to a more immersive and enjoyable reading experience.

**NEW:** PDF output is now supported for direct conversion to reMarkable devices! 
When using a reMarkable profile (Rmk1, Rmk2, RmkPP), the format automatically defaults to PDF 
for optimal compatibility with your device's native PDF reader.

*   **Downloads:** Download the latest release from [here](https://github.com/ciromattia/kcc/releases). You'll likely want `KCC_*.exe` for Windows or `kcc_macos_arm_*.dmg` for recent Macs.

*   **Installation:** Download the appropriate installer for your operating system. Follow the on-screen instructions.

*   **Usage:** Simply drag and drop your comic files into the KCC window, adjust settings (tooltips provide detailed explanations), and click convert. The generated files can then be transferred to your e-reader via USB.

*   **FAQ**
    *   **Should I use Calibre?**
      *   No. Calibre doesn't properly support fixed layout EPUB/MOBI, so modifying KCC output in Calibre will break the formatting.
        Viewing KCC output in Calibre will also not work properly.
    *   **What output format should I use?**
      *   MOBI for Kindles. CBZ for Kindle DX. CBZ for Koreader. KEPUB for Kobo.
    *   **All options have additional information in tooltips if you hover over the option.**
    *   **To get the converted book onto your Kindle/Kobo, just drag and drop the mobi/kepub into the documents folder on your Kindle/Kobo via USB**
    *   **Right to left mode not working?**
      *   RTL mode only affects splitting order for CBZ output. Your cbz reader itself sets the page turn direction.
    *   **Colors inverted?**
      *   Disable Kindle dark mode
    *   **Cannot connect Kindle Scribe or 2024+ Kindle to macOS**
      *   Use official MTP [Amazon USB File Transfer app](https://www.amazon.com/gp/help/customer/display.html/ref=hp_Connect_USB_MTP?nodeId=TCUBEdEkbIhK07ysFu)
        (no login required). Works much better than previously recommended Android File Transfer. Cannot run simutaneously with other transfer apps.
    *   **How to make AZW3 instead of MOBI?**
      *   The `.mobi` file generated by KCC is a dual filetype, it's both MOBI and AZW3. The file extension is `.mobi` for compatibility reasons.
    *   **Windows 7 support](https://github.com/ciromattia/kcc/issues/678)**
    *   **Image too dark?**
      *   The default gamma correction of 1.8 makes the image darker, and is useful for faded/gray artwork/text. Disable by setting gamma = 1.0
    *   **Huge margins / slow page turns?**
      *   You likely modified the file during transfer using a 3rd party app. Try simply dragging and dropping the final mobi/kepub file into the Kindle documents folder via USB.

*   **Prerequisites:** You'll need to install various tools to access important but optional features. Close and re-open KCC to get KCC to detect them.
  *   **KindleGen**
      *   On Windows and macOS, install [Kindle Previewer](https://www.amazon.com/Kindle-Previewer/b?ie=UTF8&node=21381691011) and `kindlegen` will be autodetected from it.
      *   If you have issues detecting it, get stuck on the MOBI conversion step, or use Linux AppImage or Flatpak, refer to the wiki: https://github.com/ciromattia/kcc/wiki/Installation#kindlegen
  *   **7-Zip**
      *   This is optional but will make conversions much faster.
      *   This is required for certain files and advanced features. 
      *   KCC will ask you to install if needed.
      *   Refer to the wiki to install: https://github.com/ciromattia/kcc/wiki/Installation#7-zip

*   **Input Formats**
    *   **KCC** can understand and convert, at the moment, the following input types:
      *   Folders containing: PNG, JPG, GIF or WebP files
      *   CBZ, ZIP *(With `7z` executable)*
      *   CBR, RAR *(With `7z` executable)*
      *   CB7, 7Z *(With `7z` executable)*
      *   PDF *(Only extracting JPG images)*
*   **Usage**
    *   Should be pretty self-explanatory. All options have detailed information in tooltips.
      After completed conversion, you should find ready file alongside the original input file (same directory).
    *   Please check [our wiki](https://github.com/ciromattia/kcc/wiki/) for more details.
    *   CLI version of **KCC** is intended for power users. It allows using options that might not be compatible and decrease the quality of output.
    CLI version has reduced dependencies, on Debian based distributions this commands should install all needed dependencies:
    ```
    sudo apt-get install python3 p7zip-full python3-pil python3-psutil python3-slugify
    ```
