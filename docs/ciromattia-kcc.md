## FAQ

*   **Should I use Calibre?** No, Calibre doesn't properly support fixed layout EPUB/MOBI, so modifying KCC output in Calibre will break the formatting.
*   **What output format should I use?** MOBI for Kindles. CBZ for Kindle DX. CBZ for Koreader. KEPUB for Kobo.
*   **How to make AZW3 instead of MOBI?** The `.mobi` file generated by KCC is a dual filetype, it's both MOBI and AZW3. The file extension is `.mobi` for compatibility reasons.
