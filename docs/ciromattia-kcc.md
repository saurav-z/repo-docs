## FAQ

*   **Should I use Calibre?** No. Calibre doesn't properly support fixed layout EPUB/MOBI, so modifying KCC output in Calibre will break the formatting.
*   **What output format should I use?** MOBI for Kindles. CBZ for Kindle DX. CBZ for Koreader. KEPUB for Kobo.
*   **All options have additional information in tooltips if you hover over the option.**
*   **How to transfer files?** Just drag and drop the mobi/kepub into the documents folder on your Kindle/Kobo via USB
*   **Right to left mode not working?** RTL mode only affects splitting order for CBZ output. Your cbz reader itself sets the page turn direction.
*   **Colors inverted?** Disable Kindle dark mode
*   **Cannot connect Kindle Scribe or 2024+ Kindle to macOS?** Use official MTP [Amazon USB File Transfer app](https://www.amazon.com/gp/help/customer/display.html/ref=hp_Connect_USB_MTP?nodeId=TCUBEdEkbIhK07ysFu) (no login required).
*   **How to make AZW3 instead of MOBI?** The `.mobi` file generated by KCC is a dual filetype, it's both MOBI and AZW3. The file extension is `.mobi` for compatibility reasons.
*   [Windows 7 support](https://github.com/ciromattia/kcc/issues/678)
*   **Image too dark?** The default gamma correction of 1.8 makes the image darker, and is useful for faded/gray artwork/text. Disable by setting gamma = 1.0
*   **Huge margins / slow page turns?** You likely modified the file during transfer using a 3rd party app. Try simply dragging and dropping the final mobi/kepub file into the Kindle documents folder via USB.
