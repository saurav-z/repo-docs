## Why Use KCC?

KCC goes beyond simple format conversion. It addresses common formatting issues found even in official Kindle Store comics, such as:

*   Faded black levels, reducing contrast.
*   Unnecessary margins.
*   Incorrect page turn direction for manga.
*   Misaligned two-page spreads.

This results in a superior reading experience, improved battery life, faster page turns, and reduced storage requirements, especially on devices with limited resources.
