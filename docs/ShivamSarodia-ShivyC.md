# ShivyC: A C Compiler Written in Python

**ShivyC** is a hobby C compiler written in Python that allows you to compile a subset of the C11 standard. Check out the original repository [here](https://github.com/ShivamSarodia/ShivyC).

## Key Features

*   **C11 Subset Support:** ShivyC implements a subset of the C11 standard.
*   **Python-Based:** Built entirely in Python 3.
*   **Efficient Binaries:** Generates reasonably efficient x86-64 binaries.
*   **Compile-Time Error Messages:** Provides helpful error messages to aid in debugging.
*   **Optimizations:** Includes some optimizations to improve code performance.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

*   Python 3.6 or later
*   GNU binutils and glibc (typically pre-installed on Linux)

### Installation

```bash
pip3 install shivyc
```

### Example Usage

1.  Create a `hello.c` file:

    ```c
    #include <stdio.h>
    int main() {
      printf("hello, world!\n");
    }
    ```

2.  Compile and run:

    ```bash
    shivyc hello.c
    ./out
    ```

    Output:
    ```
    hello, world!
    ```

### Testing

1.  Clone the repository:

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/ShivamSarodia/ShivyC.git
    cd ShivyC
    ```

2.  Run tests:

    ```bash
    python3 -m unittest discover
    ```

### Docker Quickstart (for other architectures or environments)

1.  Clone the repository:

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/ShivamSarodia/ShivyC.git
    cd ShivyC
    ```

2.  Run the Docker setup:

    ```bash
    docker/shell
    ```

    Within the Docker shell, you can compile and test:

    ```bash
    shivyc any_c_file.c  # compile a C file
    python3 -m unittest discover  # run tests
    ```

    The Docker environment automatically reflects local changes to ShivyC.

## Implementation Overview

*   **Preprocessor:** Handles comments and `#include` directives (implemented in `lexer.py` and `preproc.py`).
*   **Lexer:** Transforms source code into tokens (implemented primarily in `lexer.py`, `tokens.py`, and `token_kinds.py`).
*   **Parser:** Uses recursive descent parsing to create a parse tree (in `parser/*.py` and `tree/*.py`).
*   **IL Generation:** Generates a custom Intermediate Language (IL) from the parse tree (in `il_cmds/*.py`, `il_gen.py`, and `tree/*.py`).
*   **ASM Generation:** Converts IL commands into x86-64 assembly code, including register allocation using George and Appelâ€™s iterated register coalescing algorithm (in `asm_gen.py`, `il_cmds/*.py`).
