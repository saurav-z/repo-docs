## üöÄ Getting Started

Get up and running with Mobile-Use in a few simple steps:

1.  **Set up Environment Variables:**

    *   Copy the example `.env.example` file to `.env` and add your API keys.  An OpenAI key is required.

    ```bash
    cp .env.example .env
    ```

2.  **(Optional) Customize LLM Configuration:**

    *   To use different models or providers, create your own LLM configuration file:

    ```bash
    cp llm-config.override.template.jsonc llm-config.override.jsonc
    ```

    *   Edit `llm-config.override.jsonc` to fit your needs.

### Quick Launch (Docker - Android Only)

> [!NOTE]
> This quickstart is available for Android devices/emulators only and requires Docker.

1.  **Connect your Android device:**  Either plug in your device with USB debugging enabled, or launch an Android emulator.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> The terminal will sometimes hang while Maestro runs.  You will be asked `Maestro CLI would like to collect anonymous usage data to improve the product.` You can accept (Y) or decline (n).

2.  **Run the appropriate command for your OS:**

    *   **Linux/macOS:**

    ```bash
    chmod +x mobile-use.sh
    ./mobile-use.sh \
      "Open Gmail, find first 3 unread emails, and list their sender and subject line" \
      --output-description "A JSON list of objects, each with 'sender' and 'subject' keys"
    ```

    *   **Windows (PowerShell):**

    ```powershell
    powershell.exe -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File mobile-use.ps1 `
      "Open Gmail, find first 3 unread emails, and list their sender and subject line" `
      --output-description "A JSON list of objects, each with 'sender' and 'subject' keys"
    ```

> [!NOTE]
> When using your own device, accept the ADB-related connection requests that will appear on your device. Maestro will also install its APK; accept the installation request.

#### üß∞ Troubleshooting

The script attempts to connect to your device via IP.  Ensure your device is connected to the same Wi-Fi network as your computer.

##### 1. No device IP found

If this error occurs:

```
Could not get device IP. Is a device connected via USB and on the same Wi-Fi network?
```

Determine your phone's WLAN interface via `adb shell ip addr show up`.  Then, add the `--interface <YOUR_INTERFACE_NAME>` option to the script.

##### 2. Failed to connect to <DEVICE_IP>:5555 inside Docker

This is likely a firewall issue. There isn't a single fix.

##### 3. Failed to pull GHCR docker images (unauthorized)

If you've used `ghcr.io` before for private repositories, you may have an expired token.  Try running `docker logout ghcr.io` and re-running the script.

### Manual Launch (Development Mode)

For developers, here's how to set up your environment manually:

#### 1. Device Support

Mobile-Use currently supports:

*   Physical Android Phones (USB debugging enabled)

#### 2. Prerequisites

**Android:**

*   [Android Debug Bridge (ADB)](https://developer.android.com/studio/releases/platform-tools)

**iOS:**

*   [Xcode](https://developer.apple.com/xcode/)

**General:**

*   [uv](https://github.com/astral-sh/uv) (Python package manager)
*   [Maestro](https://maestro.mobile.dev/getting-started/installing-maestro)

#### 3. Installation

1.  **Clone the repository:**

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/minitap-ai/mobile-use.git && cd mobile-use
    ```

2.  [**Setup environment variables**](#-getting-started)

3.  **Create & activate the virtual environment:**

    ```bash
    # This will create a .venv directory using the Python version in .python-version
    uv venv

    # Activate the environment
    # On macOS/Linux:
    source .venv/bin/activate
    # On Windows:
    .venv\Scripts\activate
    ```

4.  **Install dependencies:**

    ```bash
    # Sync with the locked dependencies for a consistent setup
    uv sync
    ```

## üë®‚Äçüíª Usage

To run Mobile-Use, pass your command as an argument:

**Example 1: Basic Command**

```bash
python ./src/mobile_use/main.py "Go to settings and tell me my current battery level"
```

**Example 2: Data Scraping**

```bash
python ./src/mobile_use/main.py \
  "Open Gmail, find all unread emails, and list their sender and subject line" \
