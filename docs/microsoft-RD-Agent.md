## Key Features

*   **Automated R&D:**  R&D-Agent automates key steps in the R&D process, including idea generation, implementation, and evaluation.
*   **Multi-Agent Framework:**  RD-Agent is built on a multi-agent architecture, allowing for collaboration and specialization in various tasks.
*   **Data-Centric Approach:** The framework focuses on data-driven scenarios, enabling more effective model and data development.
*   **Extensible and Flexible:** Designed to easily integrate with various datasets, models, and tools, making it adaptable to diverse R&D challenges.
*   **Top-Performing on MLE-bench:** R&D-Agent achieves state-of-the-art results on the MLE-bench benchmark, demonstrating its ability to excel in real-world ML engineering tasks.

## Quick Start

*   RD-Agent currently supports Linux.
*   **Installation:**
    *   Install Docker.  See the [official Docker page](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/) for installation instructions.
    *   Create and activate a Conda environment.
    *   Install the RD-Agent package using `pip install rdagent`.
*   **Configuration:**  Set up your environment variables, including your LLM provider details (e.g., OpenAI API key, Azure OpenAI API key).  We now fully support **[LiteLLM](https://github.com/BerriAI/litellm)** as our default backend for integration with multiple LLM providers.
*   **Run the Application:** Execute `rdagent health_check` to verify your configuration. Then, run one of the provided demo applications (e.g., `rdagent fin_quant`) to see RD-Agent in action. See the [documentation](https://rdagent.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html) for more details.
