### ü•á Machine Learning Engineering Agent on MLE-Bench

RD-Agent consistently demonstrates high performance, outperforming existing solutions on the [MLE-bench](https://github.com/openai/mle-bench).

**Performance Highlights:**

| Agent                      | Low == Lite (%) | Medium (%) | High (%) | All (%) |
| -------------------------- | --------------- | ----------- | -------- | -------- |
| R&D-Agent o1-preview       | 48.18 ¬± 2.49    | 8.95 ¬± 2.36 | 18.67 ¬± 2.98 | 22.4 ¬± 1.1  |
| R&D-Agent o3(R)+GPT-4.1(D) | 51.52 ¬± 6.21    | 7.89 ¬± 3.33 | 16.67 ¬± 3.65 | 22.45 ¬± 2.45 |
| AIDE o1-preview            | 34.3 ¬± 2.4      | 8.8 ¬± 1.1   | 10.0 ¬± 1.9 | 16.9 ¬± 1.1 |
