## üöÄ Quick Start

Get started with R&D-Agent in just a few steps!

### üõ†Ô∏è Installation

R&D-Agent currently supports Linux.

#### üê≥ Docker Installation
Ensure that Docker is installed on your system by following the [official Docker installation instructions](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/). Then, make sure that the current user has permission to run Docker commands without `sudo` by executing `docker run hello-world`.

#### üêç Conda Environment

1.  Create a Conda environment (Python 3.10 or 3.11 recommended):

    ```bash
    conda create -n rdagent python=3.10
    ```

2.  Activate the environment:

    ```bash
    conda activate rdagent
    ```

#### üì¶ Install R&D-Agent

*   **For Users:** Install from PyPI:

    ```bash
    pip install rdagent
    ```

*   **For Developers:** Install from source (for the latest features or contribution):

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/microsoft/RD-Agent
    cd RD-Agent
    make dev
    ```

### üíä Health Check

Verify your installation:

```bash
rdagent health_check --no-check-env
```

### ‚öôÔ∏è Configuration

1.  Configure Chat and Embedding Models:

    R&D-Agent uses LiteLLM by default. Set your `CHAT_MODEL` and `EMBEDDING_MODEL` in a `.env` file.

    *   **Option 1: Unified API (Recommended):**

        ```bash
        cat << EOF  > .env
        CHAT_MODEL=gpt-4o
        EMBEDDING_MODEL=text-embedding-3-small
        OPENAI_API_BASE=<your_unified_api_base>
        OPENAI_API_KEY=<your_openai_api_key>
        EOF
        ```

    *   **Option 2: Separate API Bases:**

        ```bash
        cat << EOF  > .env
        CHAT_MODEL=gpt-4o
        OPENAI_API_BASE=<your_chat_api_base>
        OPENAI_API_KEY=<your_openai_api_key>

        EMBEDDING_MODEL=litellm_proxy/BAAI/bge-large-en-v1.5
        LITELLM_PROXY_API_KEY=<your_siliconflow_api_key>
        LITELLM_PROXY_API_BASE=https://api.siliconflow.cn/v1
        EOF
        ```

    *   **DeepSeek Setup Example:**

        ```bash
        cat << EOF  > .env
        CHAT_MODEL=deepseek/deepseek-chat
        DEEPSEEK_API_KEY=<your_deepseek_api_key>

        EMBEDDING_MODEL=litellm_proxy/BAAI/bge-m3
        LITELLM_PROXY_API_KEY=<your_siliconflow_api_key>
        LITELLM_PROXY_API_BASE=https://api.siliconflow.cn/v1
        EOF
        ```

    **Important:** If using reasoning models, set: `REASONING_THINK_RM=True`

2.  Verify Configuration:

    ```bash
    rdagent health_check
    ```

### üìä Benchmark
*   [Towards Data-Centric Automatic R&D](https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.11276)

### üîç Research
*   In a data mining expert's daily research and development process, they propose a hypothesis (e.g., a model structure like RNN can capture patterns in time-series data), design experiments (e.g., finance data contains time-series and we can verify the hypothesis in this scenario), implement the experiment as code (e.g., Pytorch model structure), and then execute the code to get feedback (e.g., metrics, loss curve, etc.). The experts learn from the feedback and improve in the next iteration.
