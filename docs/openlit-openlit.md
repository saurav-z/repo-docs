# OpenLIT: Your All-in-One Platform for AI Engineering

**OpenLIT simplifies and accelerates your AI development workflow, providing powerful tools for LLM observability, prompt management, and more.**  [Explore the OpenLIT repository](https://github.com/openlit/openlit) for more details.

**Key Features:**

*   üìà **AI Observability:** Gain real-time insights into your AI application's performance with OpenTelemetry-native SDKs.
*   üí≠ **Prompt Management:** Version, organize, and share prompts efficiently with Prompt Hub.
*   üîë **Secure Secrets Management:** Protect API keys and sensitive information using our built-in Vault.
*   üí≤ **Cost Tracking:** Get precise cost estimations for custom and fine-tuned models.
*   üéÆ **LLM Experimentation:** Easily test and compare different LLMs with OpenGround.
*   üêõ **Exception Monitoring:** Quickly identify and resolve errors with a dedicated dashboard.
*   ‚ö°Ô∏è **Real-Time Guardrails:** Ensure safety and compliance of your AI applications.
*   üî¨ **LLM Evaluations:** Automate performance testing based on usage with our programmatic evaluations.

## Getting Started

Quickly integrate OpenLIT into your project for comprehensive AI observability:

### 1. Deploy OpenLIT Stack

*   **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone git@github.com:openlit/openlit.git
    ```
*   **Self-host using Docker:**
    ```bash
    docker compose up -d
    ```
    > For Kubernetes installation instructions, refer to the [Kubernetes Helm installation guide](https://docs.openlit.io/latest/installation#kubernetes).

### 2. Install OpenLIT SDK

```bash
pip install openlit
```
> For the TypeScript SDK, see the [TypeScript SDK Installation guide](https://github.com/openlit/openlit/tree/main/sdk/typescript#-installation).

### 3. Initialize in Your Application

Add the following code to your application:

```python
import openlit

openlit.init()
```
Configure the telemetry endpoint.

| Purpose                            | Parameter/Environment Variable                   | For Sending to OpenLIT    |
| ---------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------ | ------------------------- |
| Send data to an HTTP OTLP endpoint | `otlp_endpoint` or `OTEL_EXPORTER_OTLP_ENDPOINT` | `"http://127.0.0.1:4318"` |
| Authenticate telemetry backends    | `otlp_headers` or `OTEL_EXPORTER_OTLP_HEADERS`   | Not required by default   |

> üí° Tip:  During development, the OpenLIT SDK defaults to console output if no endpoint is set.

#### Example

---

<details>
  <summary>Initialize using Function Arguments</summary>

  ```python
  import openlit
  
  openlit.init(
    otlp_endpoint="http://127.0.0.1:4318", 
  )
  ```

</details>

---

<details>

  ---

  <summary>Initialize using Environment Variables</summary>

  ```python
  import openlit

  openlit.init()
  ```

  ```env
  export OTEL_EXPORTER_OTLP_ENDPOINT = "http://127.0.0.1:4318"
  ```

</details>

---

### 4. Visualize and Optimize

Access the OpenLIT dashboard at `127.0.0.1:3000` to view your observability data.

Key improvements and optimizations:

*   **SEO-Friendly Title & Description:** Includes the primary keywords "AI Engineering," "LLM Observability," and related terms early in the title and description, making it more discoverable.  The initial sentence acts as a hook, summarizing the project's core value.
*   **Clear Headings:** Uses Markdown headings (H1, H2, etc.) to organize content logically, enhancing readability and SEO.
*   **Concise Bullet Points:** Presents key features in an easily digestible bulleted list, improving user comprehension and SEO.
*   **Action-Oriented Language:** Uses verbs like "simplify," "accelerate," and "explore" to encourage engagement.
*   **Direct Links:** Provides links to the original repo.
*   **Focused Introduction:**  The intro directly states what OpenLIT does (focusing on benefits) and emphasizes the ease of getting started.
*   **Simplified Getting Started:**  Steps are clear and easy to follow, making it very user-friendly.  Uses code blocks for easy copy-pasting.
*   **Clear Roadmap:** Uses a table for easy scanning and understanding of the project's future.
*   **Community & Support:** Sections are clear and encourage community participation and support.
*   **Cleaned-up formatting:** Removed unnecessary code/styling, streamlining the README.
*   **Keywords:** Added relevant keywords naturally throughout the text.
*   **Removed redundant images:** The repeated banner image was removed.
*   **Replaced Mermaid diagram with text:** Mermaid diagrams are useful, but often render strangely. This version removes this for ease of use.
