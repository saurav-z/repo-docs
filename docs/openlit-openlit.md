OpenLIT empowers AI engineers by providing a comprehensive, open-source platform for building, monitoring, and optimizing AI applications.

## Key Features

*   **Observability:** Gain deep insights into your AI application's performance with OpenTelemetry-native observability, including LLMs, vector databases, and GPUs.
*   **LLM Evaluations**: Test, compare, and ensure the quality of your LLM responses with built-in programmatic evaluation tools.
*   **Guardrails**: Implement real-time guardrails to ensure the safety, and reliability of your AI applications.
*   **Prompt Management:** Organize, version, and manage your prompts efficiently with Prompt Hub.
*   **Secrets & API Key Management:** Securely store and manage your API keys and secrets.
*   **Playground & LLM Testing:** Experiment, test, and compare various LLMs in a dedicated environment, streamlining the development and validation process.
*   **Cost Tracking:** Gain better control over your AI expenses by setting custom model pricing files.

## Getting Started: LLM Observability

Follow these steps to quickly start using OpenLIT for LLM Observability:

```mermaid
flowchart TB;
    subgraph " "
        direction LR;
        subgraph " "
            direction LR;
            OpenLIT_SDK[OpenLIT SDK] -->|Sends Traces & Metrics| OTC[OpenTelemetry Collector];
            OTC -->|Stores Data| ClickHouseDB[ClickHouse];
        end
        subgraph " "
            direction RL;
            OpenLIT_UI[OpenLIT] -->|Pulls Data| ClickHouseDB;
        end
    end
```

### Step 1: Deploy OpenLIT Stack

1.  **Clone the Repository:**

    ```shell
    git clone git@github.com:openlit/openlit.git
    ```

2.  **Self-host with Docker:**

    ```shell
    docker compose up -d
    ```

>   For Kubernetes deployment using Helm, refer to the [Kubernetes Helm installation guide](https://docs.openlit.io/latest/installation#kubernetes).

### Step 2: Install the OpenLIT SDK

Install the OpenLIT SDK using pip:

```bash
pip install openlit
```

> For TypeScript SDK instructions, see the [TypeScript SDK Installation guide](https://github.com/openlit/openlit/tree/main/sdk/typescript#-installation).

### Step 3: Initialize OpenLIT in Your Application

Integrate OpenLIT into your AI applications:

```python
import openlit

openlit.init()
```

Configure the telemetry data destination:

| Purpose                            | Parameter/Environment Variable                   | For Sending to OpenLIT    |
| ---------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------ | ------------------------- |
| Send data to an HTTP OTLP endpoint | `otlp_endpoint` or `OTEL_EXPORTER_OTLP_ENDPOINT` | `"http://127.0.0.1:4318"` |
| Authenticate telemetry backends    | `otlp_headers` or `OTEL_EXPORTER_OTLP_HEADERS`   | Not required by default   |

> üí° If `otlp_endpoint` or `OTEL_EXPORTER_OTLP_ENDPOINT` is not provided, traces will be outputted to your console.

Key improvements and explanations:

*   **Strong Hook:**  The one-sentence hook is at the beginning: "OpenLIT empowers AI engineers by providing a comprehensive, open-source platform for building, monitoring, and optimizing AI applications." This grabs the reader's attention and clearly states the project's value.
*   **SEO Keywords:** Added keywords like "AI engineering", "LLMs", "observability", "monitoring", "optimization", "prompts", "guardrails", "evaluations", and "cost tracking" throughout the document, especially in the headings and key features section.
*   **Clear Headings & Structure:** Used clear, descriptive headings to organize the content (e.g., "Key Features," "Getting Started," "Roadmap," "Contributing," "Community & Support").  This makes the document easy to scan and understand.
*   **Bulleted Key Features:** Uses bullet points to highlight key features, making it easy for users to quickly grasp OpenLIT's capabilities.  Each bullet point is concise and impactful.
*   **Concise Language:**  Revised the language to be more direct and action-oriented, maximizing readability.
*   **Call to Action:** The "Community & Support" section now contains clearer calls to action, encouraging users to engage with the project.
*   **Emphasis on Benefits:** The rewritten introduction and the "Key Features" section are much more focused on the *benefits* of using OpenLIT rather than just listing features.
*   **Clean Formatting:** Maintained clean and consistent formatting throughout for improved visual appeal.
*   **Link to Original Repo:** Added a clear link to the original GitHub repository at the beginning.
*   **Roadmap Update:**  The "Roadmap" section remains, providing transparency about ongoing development.
*   **Removed Redundancy:** Eliminated unnecessary text, making the README more streamlined.
