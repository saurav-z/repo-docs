OpenLIT streamlines your AI development, particularly for Generative AI and LLMs. With OpenLIT, you can effortlessly experiment with LLMs, manage prompts effectively, and securely handle API keys. It provides OpenTelemetry-native observability with just one line of code, offering complete monitoring across LLMs, vector databases, and GPUs. Build and deploy AI features with confidence, moving seamlessly from testing to production.  OpenLIT fully supports the [Semantic Conventions](https://github.com/open-telemetry/semantic-conventions/tree/main/docs/gen-ai) with the OpenTelemetry community, staying current with Observability standards.

## Key Features of OpenLIT

*   **üìà Analytics Dashboard:**  Visualize AI application health and performance with dashboards for metrics, costs, and user interactions.
*   **üîå OpenTelemetry-native SDKs:**  Vendor-neutral SDKs to send traces and metrics to your existing observability tools, for unified monitoring.
*   **üí≤ Cost Tracking:**  Optimize budgets with detailed cost estimations for custom and fine-tuned models using customizable pricing files.
*   **üêõ Exceptions Monitoring:**  Quickly identify and resolve issues with a dedicated dashboard for tracking exceptions and errors.
*   **üí≠ Prompt Management:**  Organize and version prompts in a Prompt Hub for consistent, easy access across all applications.
*   **üîë API Key & Secret Management:**  Securely manage API keys and secrets centrally to improve security.
*   **üéÆ Experiment with LLMs:**  Use OpenGround to test and compare various LLMs, for better model selection.

## Getting Started with OpenLIT - LLM Observability

Here's how to easily set up OpenLIT and start gaining observability into your LLM applications:

### Step 1: Deploy OpenLIT Stack

1.  **Clone the Repository:**

    ```shell
    git clone git@github.com:openlit/openlit.git
    ```

2.  **Self-host using Docker:**

    ```shell
    docker compose up -d
    ```
    *For Kubernetes installation, see the [Kubernetes Helm installation guide](https://docs.openlit.io/latest/installation#kubernetes).*

### Step 2: Install OpenLIT SDK

Choose the SDK for your project:

```bash
pip install openlit  # Python SDK
```
*For the TypeScript SDK, please see the [TypeScript SDK Installation guide](https://github.com/openlit/openlit/tree/main/sdk/typescript#-installation).*

### Step 3: Initialize OpenLIT in Your Application

Integrate OpenLIT into your AI applications by adding the necessary initialization code.

```python
import openlit

openlit.init()
```

Configure the telemetry data destination:

| Purpose                            | Parameter/Environment Variable                   | For Sending to OpenLIT    |
| ---------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------ | ------------------------- |
| Send data to an HTTP OTLP endpoint | `otlp_endpoint` or `OTEL_EXPORTER_OTLP_ENDPOINT` | `"http://127.0.0.1:4318"` |
| Authenticate telemetry backends    | `otlp_headers` or `OTEL_EXPORTER_OTLP_HEADERS`   | Not required by default   |

>   **üí° Note:**  If no `otlp_endpoint` is given, the SDK will output traces to your console during development.

#### Example Code

---

<details>
  <summary>Initialize using Function Arguments</summary>

  Add the following two lines to your application code:

  ```python
  import openlit

  openlit.init(
    otlp_endpoint="http://127.0.0.1:4318",
  )
  ```

</details>

---

<details>

  ---

  <summary>Initialize using Environment Variables</summary>

  Add the following two lines to your application code:

  ```python
  import openlit

  openlit.init()
  ```

  Then, configure the your OTLP endpoint using environment variable:

  ```env
  export OTEL_EXPORTER_OTLP_ENDPOINT = "http://127.0.0.1:4318"
  ```

</details>

---

### Step 4: Visualize and Optimize

With OpenLIT collecting your observability data, you can start to visualize and analyze this data to improve your AI application.

*   Access your OpenLIT dashboard by going to `127.0.0.1:3000` in your browser.
*   Log in with the default credentials:  **Email:** `user@openlit.io`, **Password:** `openlituser`
