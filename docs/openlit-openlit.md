## Key Features

OpenLIT provides a comprehensive suite of tools to help you build, monitor, and optimize your AI applications, especially those leveraging Generative AI and LLMs.  Here's a look at what OpenLIT has to offer:

*   **Observability:** Gain deep insights into your AI application's health and performance.  Monitor metrics, costs, and user interactions via detailed dashboards.  OpenTelemetry-native SDKs allow integration with existing observability tools.
*   **Cost Management:** Track and optimize costs for custom and fine-tuned LLM models.  Utilize custom pricing files for accurate budgeting.
*   **Error Monitoring:** Identify and resolve issues quickly with a dedicated dashboard for exception and error tracking.
*   **Prompt Management:** Organize and version prompts with Prompt Hub for consistent access and streamlined application development.
*   **Security:** Securely manage API keys and secrets to prevent vulnerabilities.
*   **Experimentation:** Easily test and compare different LLMs with OpenGround.
*   **Guardrails:** Real-time guardrails implementation.
*   **Evaluations:** Programmatic evaluation for LLM responses.

**[Explore the OpenLIT repository on GitHub](https://github.com/openlit/openlit)**

## Getting Started with OpenLIT

This quickstart guide helps you get started with LLM observability.

### 1. Deploy the OpenLIT Stack

1.  **Clone the Repository:**

    ```bash
    git clone git@github.com:openlit/openlit.git
    ```

2.  **Self-host with Docker:**

    ```bash
    docker compose up -d
    ```

    > For Kubernetes installation using Helm, see the [Kubernetes Helm installation guide](https://docs.openlit.io/latest/installation#kubernetes).

### 2. Install the OpenLIT SDK

```bash
pip install openlit
```

> For the TypeScript SDK, see the [TypeScript SDK Installation guide](https://github.com/openlit/openlit/tree/main/sdk/typescript#-installation).

### 3. Initialize OpenLIT in Your Application

Integrate OpenLIT into your AI applications with the following lines of code.

```python
import openlit

openlit.init()
```

Configure the telemetry data destination:

| Purpose                            | Parameter/Environment Variable                   | For Sending to OpenLIT    |
| ---------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------ | ------------------------- |
| Send data to an HTTP OTLP endpoint | `otlp_endpoint` or `OTEL_EXPORTER_OTLP_ENDPOINT` | `"http://127.0.0.1:4318"` |
| Authenticate telemetry backends    | `otlp_headers` or `OTEL_EXPORTER_OTLP_HEADERS`   | Not required by default   |

> üí° Info: If the `otlp_endpoint` or `OTEL_EXPORTER_OTLP_ENDPOINT` is not provided, the OpenLIT SDK will output traces directly to your console, which is recommended during the development phase.

#### Example

---

<details>
  <summary>Initialize using Function Arguments</summary>

  Add the following two lines to your application code:
  
  ```python
  import openlit
  
  openlit.init(
    otlp_endpoint="http://127.0.0.1:4318", 
  )
  ```

</details>

---

<details>

  ---

  <summary>Initialize using Environment Variables</summary>
  
  Add the following two lines to your application code:

  ```python
  import openlit

  openlit.init()
  ```
  
  Then, configure the your OTLP endpoint using environment variable:

  ```env
  export OTEL_EXPORTER_OTLP_ENDPOINT = "http://127.0.0.1:4318"
  ```

</details>

---

### 4. Visualize and Optimize

Access OpenLIT at `127.0.0.1:3000` in your browser to explore your observability data. Log in with:

*   **Email:** `user@openlit.io`
*   **Password:** `openlituser`
