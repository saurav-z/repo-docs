## Key Features:

*   **OpenTelemetry-native Observability:** Get full-stack monitoring for your LLMs, vector databases, and GPUs with just one line of code.
*   **Analytics Dashboard:** Monitor AI application health, performance, costs, and user interactions.
*   **Cost Tracking:** Tailor cost estimations for custom and fine-tuned models.
*   **Exception Monitoring:** Quickly identify and resolve issues with a dedicated monitoring dashboard.
*   **Prompt Management:** Organize and version prompts using Prompt Hub for consistency.
*   **API Key and Secrets Management:** Securely handle API keys and secrets.
*   **LLM Experimentation:** Test and compare various LLMs with OpenGround.

## Getting Started

### Step 1: Deploy OpenLIT Stack

1.  **Clone the Repository:**

    ```bash
    git clone git@github.com:openlit/openlit.git
    ```
2.  **Self-host using Docker:**

    ```bash
    docker compose up -d
    ```

    *For Kubernetes installation instructions, see the [Kubernetes Helm installation guide](https://docs.openlit.io/latest/installation#kubernetes).*

### Step 2: Install OpenLIT SDK

```bash
pip install openlit
```

*For the TypeScript SDK, see the [TypeScript SDK Installation guide](https://github.com/openlit/openlit/tree/main/sdk/typescript#-installation).*

### Step 3: Initialize OpenLIT in Your Application

Add these lines to your code:

```python
import openlit
openlit.init()
```

Configure the telemetry data destination using:

| Purpose                            | Parameter/Environment Variable                   | For Sending to OpenLIT    |
| ---------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------ | ------------------------- |
| Send data to an HTTP OTLP endpoint | `otlp_endpoint` or `OTEL_EXPORTER_OTLP_ENDPOINT` | `"http://127.0.0.1:4318"` |
| Authenticate telemetry backends    | `otlp_headers` or `OTEL_EXPORTER_OTLP_HEADERS`   | Not required by default   |

> 💡 If no `otlp_endpoint` is provided, the SDK outputs traces to the console during development.

#### Example

---

<details>
  <summary>Initialize using Function Arguments</summary>

  Add the following two lines to your application code:
  
  ```python
  import openlit
  
  openlit.init(
    otlp_endpoint="http://127.0.0.1:4318", 
  )
  ```

</details>

---

<details>

  ---

  <summary>Initialize using Environment Variables</summary>
  
  Add the following two lines to your application code:

  ```python
  import openlit

  openlit.init()
  ```
  
  Then, configure the your OTLP endpoint using environment variable:

  ```env
  export OTEL_EXPORTER_OTLP_ENDPOINT = "http://127.0.0.1:4318"
  ```

</details>

### Step 4: Visualize and Optimize

Access the OpenLIT dashboard at `127.0.0.1:3000` with the following credentials:

-   **Email**: `user@openlit.io`
-   **Password**: `openlituser`

Key improvements and SEO considerations:

*   **Clear, Concise Hook:** The first sentence directly highlights the core benefit: simplifying AI development and providing observability.
*   **Keyword Optimization:** Included relevant keywords like "AI Engineering," "LLMs," "Observability," "Monitoring," and specific feature names (e.g., "Prompt Management").
*   **Structured Headings:**  Used clear, descriptive headings and subheadings for readability and SEO.
*   **Bulleted Lists:** Emphasized key features with bullet points for easy scanning.
*   **Concise Language:** Removed unnecessary words and phrases.
