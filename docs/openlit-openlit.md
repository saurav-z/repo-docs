OpenLIT revolutionizes AI development by simplifying tasks like LLM experimentation, prompt management, and API key security, providing powerful features to build AI features and applications, transitioning smoothly from testing to production. With one line of code, you can enable **OpenTelemetry-native** observability, offering full-stack monitoring that includes LLMs, vector databases, and GPUs.

This project proudly follows and maintains the [Semantic Conventions](https://github.com/open-telemetry/semantic-conventions/tree/main/docs/gen-ai) with the OpenTelemetry community, consistently updating to align with the latest standards in Observability.

## Key Features

*   üìà **AI Application Monitoring:** Utilize detailed dashboards to monitor your AI application's performance, costs, and user interactions, improving overall efficiency.
*   üîå **OpenTelemetry-native Observability:**  Integrate vendor-neutral SDKs to send traces and metrics to your preferred observability tools.
*   üí≤ **Cost Optimization:** Accurately track the costs of custom and fine-tuned models with custom pricing files for budgeting.
*   üêõ **Error Tracking:** Easily identify and resolve issues with a dedicated dashboard for monitoring exceptions and errors.
*   üí≠ **Prompt Management:**  Efficiently manage and version prompts using Prompt Hub for consistent access across all applications.
*   üîë **Secure API Key Handling:**  Safely manage your API keys and secrets centrally, mitigating security risks.
*   üéÆ **LLM Experimentation:** Test and compare various LLMs side-by-side using OpenGround.

## Getting Started with OpenLIT: LLM Observability

This guide will help you set up LLM observability using OpenLIT.

        end
    end
```

### Step 1: Deploy OpenLIT Stack

1.  **Clone the Repository:**
    Open your command line or terminal and run:

    ```shell
    git clone git@github.com:openlit/openlit.git
    ```

2.  **Self-host with Docker:**

    Deploy and run OpenLIT using the following command:

    ```shell
    docker compose up -d
    ```

> For instructions on installing in Kubernetes using Helm, refer to the [Kubernetes Helm installation guide](https://docs.openlit.io/latest/installation#kubernetes).

### Step 2: Install OpenLIT SDK

Open your command line or terminal and run:

```bash
pip install openlit
```

> For instructions on using the TypeScript SDK, visit the [TypeScript SDK Installation guide](https://github.com/openlit/openlit/tree/main/sdk/typescript#-installation).

### Step 3: Initialize OpenLIT in Your Application

Integrate OpenLIT into your AI applications by adding the following lines to your code.

```python
import openlit

openlit.init()
```

Configure the telemetry data destination as follows:

| Purpose                            | Parameter/Environment Variable                   | For Sending to OpenLIT    |
| ---------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------ | ------------------------- |
| Send data to an HTTP OTLP endpoint | `otlp_endpoint` or `OTEL_EXPORTER_OTLP_ENDPOINT` | `"http://127.0.0.1:4318"` |
| Authenticate telemetry backends    | `otlp_headers` or `OTEL_EXPORTER_OTLP_HEADERS`   | Not required by default   |

> üí° **Info:** If the `otlp_endpoint` or `OTEL_EXPORTER_OTLP_ENDPOINT` is not provided, the OpenLIT SDK will output traces directly to your console, which is recommended during the development phase.

#### Example

---

<details>
  <summary>Initialize using Function Arguments</summary>

  Add the following two lines to your application code:
  
  ```python
  import openlit
  
  openlit.init(
    otlp_endpoint="http://127.0.0.1:4318", 
  )
  ```

</details>

---

<details>

  ---

  <summary>Initialize using Environment Variables</summary>
  
  Add the following two lines to your application code:

  ```python
  import openlit

  openlit.init()
  ```
  
  Then, configure the your OTLP endpoint using environment variable:

  ```env
  export OTEL_EXPORTER_OTLP_ENDPOINT = "http://127.0.0.1:4318"
  ```

</details>

---

### Step 4: Visualize and Optimize

Once you've collected observability data, visualize and analyze it within OpenLIT to identify performance issues and improve your AI application.

Access OpenLIT at `127.0.0.1:3000` in your browser and log in using:

-   **Email**: `user@openlit.io`
-   **Password**: `openlituser`
