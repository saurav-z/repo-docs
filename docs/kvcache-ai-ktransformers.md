## üìÉ Brief Injection Tutorial:  Customize and Optimize

KTransformers employs a user-friendly, template-based injection framework that allows you to easily replace original PyTorch modules with optimized versions, enabling customized optimizations.

</br>
<p align="center">
  <picture>
    <img alt="Inject-Struction" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/6b4c1e54-9f6d-45c5-a3fc-8fa45e7d257e" width=65%>
  </picture>
</p>

KTransformers is particularly focused on local deployments with limited resources, supporting heterogeneous computing opportunities. It supports efficient kernels like [Llamafile](https://github.com/Mozilla-Ocho/llamafile/tree/main) and [Marlin](https://github.com/IST-DASLab/marlin). More details can be found [here](doc/en/operators/llamafile.md).

### Example Usage

Utilize the provided kernels by creating a YAML-based injection template and adding a call to `optimize_and_load_gguf` before using the Transformers model.

```python
with torch.device("meta"):
    model = AutoModelForCausalLM.from_config(config, trust_remote_code=True)
optimize_and_load_gguf(model, optimize_config_path, gguf_path, config)
...
generated = prefill_and_generate(model, tokenizer, input_tensor.cuda(), max_new_tokens=1000)
```

In this example, `AutoModel` is initialized on the meta device. `optimize_and_load_gguf` iterates through the model's sub-modules, replaces them based on your YAML rules, and injects the optimized modules. After injection, the original `generate` interface is available, along with an optimized `prefill_and_generate` method for enhanced speed.

### How to Custom Your Model

A detailed tutorial on injection and multi-GPU usage with DeepSeek-V2 can be found [here](doc/en/injection_tutorial.md).

Here's an example YAML template:

```yaml
- match:
    name: "^model\\.layers\\..*$"  # regular expression 
    class: torch.nn.Linear  # only match modules matching name and class simultaneously
  replace:
    class: ktransformers.operators.linear.KTransformerLinear  # optimized Kernel on quantized data types
    device: "cpu"   # which devices to load this module when initializing
    kwargs:
      generate_device: "cuda"
      generate_linear_type: "QuantizedLinearMarlin"
```

Each YAML rule contains `match` (specifying modules to replace) and `replace` (specifying the injected module and initialization parameters).

Example rule templates for DeepSeek-V2 and Qwen2-57B-A14 are located in the [ktransformers/optimize/optimize_rules](ktransformers/optimize/optimize_rules) directory, used in the `local_chat.py` demo. For detailed design principles, refer to the [design document](doc/en/deepseek-v2-injection.md).
