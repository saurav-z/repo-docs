## <a id="quick-start"></a> ðŸš€ Quick Start

### ðŸ“¥ Installation

To get started with KTransformers, follow these steps:

1.  **Install KTransformers:** Follow the official [Installation Guide](https://kvcache-ai.github.io/ktransformers/en/install.html).
2.  **Install Dependencies:** Make sure you have all required dependencies installed based on your chosen features.

## <a id="tutorial"></a> ðŸ“ƒ Brief Injection Tutorial

KTransformers uses a user-friendly, template-based injection framework to enhance your ðŸ¤— Transformers experience.  This approach simplifies the replacement of standard torch modules with optimized variants. It also streamlines the process of combining optimizations, allowing for the exploration of their synergistic effects.

</p>

### Example Usage

Here's how to utilize the provided kernels:

```python
with torch.device("meta"):
    model = AutoModelForCausalLM.from_config(config, trust_remote_code=True)
optimize_and_load_gguf(model, optimize_config_path, gguf_path, config)
...
generated = prefill_and_generate(model, tokenizer, input_tensor.cuda(), max_new_tokens=1000)
```

In this example, the AutoModel is first initialized on the meta device to avoid memory usage. Then, `optimize_and_load_gguf` iterates through sub-modules, matches rules in your YAML file, and replaces them with optimized modules.  After injection, the original `generate` interface is available, as well as the `prefill_and_generate` method, which enables optimizations like CUDAGraph.

### Customizing Your Model

A detailed tutorial for injection and multi-GPU use, using DeepSeek-V2 as an example, is available [here](doc/en/injection_tutorial.md).

Here is a YAML template for replacing all original Linear modules with Marlin, an advanced 4-bit quantization kernel:

```yaml
- match:
    name: "^model\\.layers\\..*$"  # regular expression
    class: torch.nn.Linear  # only match modules matching name and class simultaneously
  replace:
    class: ktransformers.operators.linear.KTransformerLinear  # optimized Kernel on quantized data types
    device: "cpu"   # which devices to load this module when initializing
    kwargs:
      generate_device: "cuda"
      generate_linear_type: "QuantizedLinearMarlin"
```

Each rule in the YAML file has two parts: `match` and `replace`. The `match` part specifies which module should be replaced, and the `replace` part specifies the module to be injected along with initialization keywords.

Find example rule templates for DeepSeek-V2 and Qwen2-57B-A14 in the [ktransformers/optimize/optimize_rules](ktransformers/optimize/optimize_rules) directory, used in the `local_chat.py` demo. For design principles and the implementation of the injection framework, refer to the [design document](doc/en/deepseek-v2-injection.md).
