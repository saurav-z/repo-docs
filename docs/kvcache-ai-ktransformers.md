## üìÉ Brief Injection Tutorial

KTransformers uses a template-based injection framework for easy module replacement.  This allows for experimenting with synergistic optimizations.

<br/>
<p align="center">
    <img alt="Inject-Struction" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/6b4c1e54-9f6d-45c5-a3fc-8fa45e7d257e" width=65%>
</p>

KTransformers focuses on local deployments, especially for resource-constrained environments. It supports heterogeneous computing, including GPU/CPU offloading and quantization. For example, we support the efficient [Llamafile](https://github.com/Mozilla-Ocho/llamafile/tree/main) and [Marlin](https://github.com/IST-DASLab/marlin) kernels for CPU and GPU, respectively. More details can be found [here](doc/en/operators/llamafile.md).

### Example Usage
Users can use the provided kernels by creating a YAML-based injection template and adding the call to `optimize_and_load_gguf` before using the Transformers model.

```python
with torch.device("meta"):
    model = AutoModelForCausalLM.from_config(config, trust_remote_code=True)
optimize_and_load_gguf(model, optimize_config_path, gguf_path, config)
...
generated = prefill_and_generate(model, tokenizer, input_tensor.cuda(), max_new_tokens=1000)
```

In this example, the AutoModel is first initialized on the meta device to avoid occupying any memory resources. Then, `optimize_and_load_gguf` iterates through all sub-modules of the model, matches rules specified in your YAML rule file, and replaces them with advanced modules as specified.

After injection, the original `generate` interface is available, but we also provide a compatible `prefill_and_generate` method, which enables further optimizations like CUDAGraph to improve generation speed.

### How to customize your model
A detailed tutorial of the injection and multi-GPU using DeepSeek-V2 as an example is given [here](doc/en/injection_tutorial.md).

Below is an example of a YAML template for replacing all original Linear modules with Marlin, an advanced 4-bit quantization kernel.

```yaml
- match:
    name: "^model\\.layers\\..*$"  # regular expression
    class: torch.nn.Linear  # only match modules matching name and class simultaneously
  replace:
    class: ktransformers.operators.linear.KTransformerLinear  # optimized Kernel on quantized data types
    device: "cpu"   # which devices to load this module when initializing
    kwargs:
      generate_device: "cuda"
      generate_linear_type: "QuantizedLinearMarlin"
```

Each rule in the YAML file has two parts: `match` and `replace`. The `match` part specifies which module should be replaced, and the `replace` part specifies the module to be injected into the model along with the initialization keywords.

You can find example rule templates for optimizing DeepSeek-V2 and Qwen2-57B-A14, two SOTA MoE models, in the [ktransformers/optimize/optimize_rules](ktransformers/optimize/optimize_rules) directory. These templates are used to power the `local_chat.py` demo.

For details on the injection framework's design and implementation, see the [design document](doc/en/deepseek-v2-injection.md).
