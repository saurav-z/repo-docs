## üìÉ Brief Injection Tutorial

KTransformers' core is a user-friendly, template-based injection framework, allowing easy module replacement with optimized variants. This simplifies combining multiple optimizations to explore synergistic effects.

<p align="center">
  <img alt="Injection Structure" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/6b4c1e54-9f6d-45c5-a3fc-8fa45e7d257e" width=65%>
</p>

KTransformers focuses on local deployments with limited resources, paying special attention to heterogeneous computing, like GPU/CPU offloading of quantized models. It supports [Llamafile](https://github.com/Mozilla-Ocho/llamafile/tree/main) and [Marlin](https://github.com/IST-DASLab/marlin) kernels for CPU and GPU. More details are available [here](doc/en/operators/llamafile.md).

### Example Usage

Use the provided kernels by creating a YAML-based injection template and adding the `optimize_and_load_gguf` call before using the Transformers model.

```python
with torch.device("meta"):
    model = AutoModelForCausalLM.from_config(config, trust_remote_code=True)
optimize_and_load_gguf(model, optimize_config_path, gguf_path, config)
...
generated = prefill_and_generate(model, tokenizer, input_tensor.cuda(), max_new_tokens=1000)
```

Here, the AutoModel initializes on the meta device. Then, `optimize_and_load_gguf` iterates through sub-modules, matches YAML rules, and replaces them with advanced modules.

After injection, the original `generate` interface is available, alongside a compatible `prefill_and_generate` method, enabling further optimizations like CUDAGraph.

### How to customize your model

A detailed tutorial on injection and multi-GPU using DeepSeek-V2 is [here](doc/en/injection_tutorial.md).

Here's a YAML template example for replacing all original Linear modules with Marlin (4-bit quantization kernel):

```yaml
- match:
    name: "^model\\.layers\\..*$"  # regular expression 
    class: torch.nn.Linear  # only match modules matching name and class simultaneously
  replace:
    class: ktransformers.operators.linear.KTransformerLinear  # optimized Kernel on quantized data types
    device: "cpu"   # which devices to load this module when initializing
    kwargs:
      generate_device: "cuda"
      generate_linear_type: "QuantizedLinearMarlin"
```

Each YAML rule has `match` and `replace` sections. The `match` specifies the module to replace, and `replace` specifies the injected module and initialization keywords.

Find example rule templates for DeepSeek-V2 and Qwen2-57B-A14 in the [ktransformers/optimize/optimize_rules](ktransformers/optimize/optimize_rules) directory, used in the `local_chat.py` demo.
