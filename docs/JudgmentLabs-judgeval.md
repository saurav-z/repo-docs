## üé¨ See Judgeval in Action

**[Multi-Agent System](https://github.com/JudgmentLabs/judgment-cookbook/tree/main/cookbooks/agents/multi-agent) with complete observability:**

1.  A multi-agent system spawns agents to research topics on the internet.
2.  With just **3 lines of code**, Judgeval captures all environment responses across all agent tool calls for monitoring.
3.  After completion,
4.  Export all interaction data to enable further environment-specific learning and optimization.
