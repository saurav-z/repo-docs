Judgeval is an open-source toolkit for evaluating and monitoring autonomous agents, providing the essential data and signals needed for continuous learning and improvement.

## Key Features

*   **Evals:** Build custom evaluators using LLM-as-a-judge, manual labeling, or code-based solutions. Integrate with our metric-tracking infrastructure for comprehensive evaluation.
    *   Unit-testing
    *   A/B testing
    *   Online guardrails
    <p align="center"><img src="assets/test.png" alt="Evaluation metrics" width="800"/></p>

*   **Monitoring:** Get real-time alerts for agent failures and identify performance regressions with custom hooks and Slack integration.
    *   Identifying degradation early
    *   Visualizing performance trends across agent versions and time
    <p align="center"><img src="assets/errors.png" alt="Monitoring Dashboard" width="1200"/></p>

*   **Datasets:** Export agent interactions to datasets for in-depth analysis and optimization. Move data to/from Parquet, S3, etc. Run evals on datasets to A/B test different agent configurations.
    *   Agent environment interaction data for optimization
    *   Scaled analysis for A/B tests

## üé¨ Judgeval in Action

**[Multi-Agent System](https://github.com/JudgmentLabs/judgment-cookbook/tree/main/cookbooks/agents/multi-agent) with complete observability:** (1) A multi-agent system spawns agents to research topics on the internet. (2) With just **3 lines of code**, Judgeval captures all environment responses across all agent tool calls for monitoring. (3) After completion, (4) export all interaction data to enable further environment-specific learning and optimization.
