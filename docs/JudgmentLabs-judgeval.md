## Judgeval in Action: See How It Works

**[Multi-Agent System](https://github.com/JudgmentLabs/judgment-cookbook/tree/main/cookbooks/agents/multi-agent) with complete observability:** (1) A multi-agent system spawns agents to research topics on the internet. (2) With just **3 lines of code**, Judgeval captures all environment responses across all agent tool calls for monitoring. (3) After completion, (4) export all interaction data to enable further environment-specific learning and optimization.
