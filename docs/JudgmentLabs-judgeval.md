## Judgeval: Open-Source Tooling for Autonomous Agent Evaluation

Judgeval is an open-source platform designed to provide crucial runtime data for evaluating, monitoring, and continuously improving autonomous, stateful agents.  **<a href="https://github.com/JudgmentLabs/judgeval">View the source code on GitHub.</a>**

## Key Features

*   **Evals:** Build custom evaluators using LLM-as-a-judge, manual labeling, or code-based methods. Connect with our metric-tracking infrastructure for comprehensive assessment.
    *   Useful for: Unit-testing, A/B testing, and Online guardrails.
    <p align="center"><img src="assets/test.png" alt="Evaluation metrics" width="800"/></p>

*   **Monitoring:** Receive real-time Slack alerts for agent failures in production.  Implement custom hooks to address production regressions.
    *   Useful for: Identifying performance degradation early and Visualizing performance trends across agent versions and time.
    <p align="center"><img src="assets/errors.png" alt="Monitoring Dashboard" width="1200"/></p>

*   **Datasets:** Export agent environment interactions and test cases into datasets.  Analyze, optimize, and A/B test different agent configurations using data exported to Parquet, S3, and more.
    *   Useful for: Agent environment interaction data for optimization and Scaled analysis for A/B tests.

**[Multi-Agent System](https://github.com/JudgmentLabs/judgment-cookbook/tree/main/cookbooks/agents/multi-agent) with complete observability:**
1.  A multi-agent system spawns agents to research topics on the internet.
2.  With just **3 lines of code**, Judgeval captures all environment responses across all agent tool calls for monitoring.
3.  After completion,
4.  Export all interaction data to enable further environment-specific learning and optimization.

## üõ†Ô∏è Installation

Get started with Judgeval by installing our SDK using pip:

```bash
pip install judgeval
```

Ensure you have your `JUDGMENT_API_KEY` and `JUDGMENT_ORG_ID` environment variables set to connect to the [Judgment Platform](https://app.judgmentlabs.ai/).

```bash
export JUDGMENT_API_KEY=...
export JUDGMENT_ORG_ID=...
```

**If you don't have keys, [create an account](https://app.judgmentlabs.ai/register) on the platform!**

## üè¢ Self-Hosting

Take control of your agent evaluation infrastructure. Judgeval offers robust self-hosting capabilities, giving you full control over your backend and data plane.

### Key Benefits:

*   Deploy Judgeval on your own AWS account.
*   Store data in your own Supabase instance.
*   Access Judgeval through your own custom domain.

### Getting Started:

1.  Review our [self-hosting documentation](https://docs.judgmentlabs.ai/documentation/self-hosting/get-started) for detailed setup instructions.
2.  Use the [Judgment CLI](https://docs.judgmentlabs.ai/documentation/developer-tools/judgment-cli/installation) to deploy your self-hosted environment.
3.  After setup, configure the `JUDGMENT_API_URL` environment variable to point to your self-hosted backend endpoint.
