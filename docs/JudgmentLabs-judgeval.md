**Judgeval** is an open-source platform providing powerful tools for evaluating and optimizing autonomous, stateful agents. It captures real-time agent-environment interactions, enabling continuous learning and improvement.

## Key Features

*   **Evaluations:** Build custom evaluators using LLMs, manual labeling, or code-based methods. Connect with our metric-tracking infrastructure for comprehensive analysis.
    *   Unit-testing
    *   A/B testing
    *   Online guardrails
    <p align="center"><img src="assets/test.png" alt="Evaluation metrics" width="800"/></p>

*   **Monitoring:** Receive instant Slack alerts for agent failures and integrate custom hooks to address production regressions.
    *   Identifying degradation early
    *   Visualizing performance trends

## üé¨ See Judgeval in Action

**[Multi-Agent System](https://github.com/JudgmentLabs/judgment-cookbook/tree/main/cookbooks/agents/multi-agent) with complete observability:** (1) A multi-agent system spawns agents to research topics on the internet. (2) With just **3 lines of code**, Judgeval captures all environment responses across all agent tool calls for monitoring. (3) After completion, (4) export all interaction data to enable further environment-specific learning and optimization.
