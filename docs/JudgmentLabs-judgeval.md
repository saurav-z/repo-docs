## Key Features

*   **Comprehensive Agent Evaluation:** Build custom evaluators using LLMs, manual labeling, or code to rigorously test your agents.

*   **Real-time Agent Monitoring:** Receive immediate Slack alerts for agent failures and identify performance regressions with custom hooks.

*   **Data-Driven Optimization:** Export environment interactions and test cases into datasets for detailed analysis and continuous improvement through A/B testing.

## üé¨ See Judgeval in Action

**[Multi-Agent System](https://github.com/JudgmentLabs/judgment-cookbook/tree/main/cookbooks/agents/multi-agent) with complete observability:** (1) A multi-agent system spawns agents to research topics on the internet. (2) With just **3 lines of code**, Judgeval captures all environment responses across all agent tool calls for monitoring. (3) After completion, (4) export all interaction data to enable further environment-specific learning and optimization.

## Getting Started

### Installation

Install the Judgeval SDK using pip:

```bash
pip install judgeval
```

Ensure you have your `JUDGMENT_API_KEY` and `JUDGMENT_ORG_ID` environment variables set to connect to the [Judgment Platform](https://app.judgmentlabs.ai/).

```bash
export JUDGMENT_API_KEY=...
export JUDGMENT_ORG_ID=...
```

**Don't have API keys? [Create an account](https://app.judgmentlabs.ai/register) on the Judgment Platform!**
