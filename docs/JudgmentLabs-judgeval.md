## Key Features

Judgeval empowers you to:

*   **Evaluate Agent Performance:** Build custom evaluators using LLM-as-a-judge, manual labeling, and code-based metrics.
*   **Monitor Agent Health:** Receive Slack alerts for failures, identify performance degradation, and visualize trends.
*   **Analyze and Optimize with Data:** Export agent interactions to datasets for scaled analysis and A/B testing, enabling continuous learning.

## üé¨ See Judgeval in Action

**[Multi-Agent System](https://github.com/JudgmentLabs/judgment-cookbook/tree/main/cookbooks/agents/multi-agent) with complete observability:** (1) A multi-agent system spawns agents to research topics on the internet. (2) With just **3 lines of code**, Judgeval captures all environment responses across all agent tool calls for monitoring. (3) After completion, (4) export all interaction data to enable further environment-specific learning and optimization.
