Judgeval provides open-source tools for evaluating and improving autonomous agents, offering crucial runtime data for continuous learning and self-improvement.

## Key Features

*   **Comprehensive Agent Evaluation:** Define custom evaluators using LLMs, manual labeling, or code-based methods. Connect your evaluations with metric-tracking infrastructure.
*   **Proactive Agent Monitoring:** Receive real-time alerts via Slack for agent failures in production. Implement custom hooks to address production regressions.
*   **Data-Driven Optimization:** Export agent interactions and test cases into datasets for in-depth analysis and improvement. Easily move data to and from Parquet, S3, and more.

## üé¨ See Judgeval in Action

**[Multi-Agent System](https://github.com/JudgmentLabs/judgment-cookbook/tree/main/cookbooks/agents/multi-agent) with complete observability:** (1) A multi-agent system spawns agents to research topics on the internet. (2) With just **3 lines of code**, Judgeval captures all environment responses across all agent tool calls for monitoring. (3) After completion, (4) export all interaction data to enable further environment-specific learning and optimization.
