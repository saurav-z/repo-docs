Judgeval is an open-source toolkit designed for evaluating and improving autonomous, stateful agents. It provides crucial runtime data from agent-environment interactions to fuel continuous learning and self-improvement.

## Key Features

*   **Evals:** Build custom evaluators using LLM-as-a-judge, manual labeling, or code-based evaluators, all integrated with our metric-tracking infrastructure.
    *   Useful for:
        *   Unit-testing
        *   A/B testing
        *   Online guardrails
    <p align="center"><img src="assets/test.png" alt="Evaluation metrics" width="800"/></p>

*   **Monitoring:** Receive Slack alerts for agent failures in production and utilize custom hooks to address regressions.
    *   Useful for:
        *   Identifying degradation early
        *   Visualizing performance trends across agent versions and time
    <p align="center"><img src="assets/errors.png" alt="Monitoring Dashboard" width="1200"/></p>

*   **Datasets:** Export agent environment interactions and test cases to datasets for in-depth analysis and optimization. Seamlessly move data to/from Parquet, S3, and more.
    *   Useful for:
        *   Agent environment interaction data for optimization
        *   Scaled analysis for A/B tests

**[Multi-Agent System](https://github.com/JudgmentLabs/judgment-cookbook/tree/main/cookbooks/agents/multi-agent) with complete observability:** (1) A multi-agent system spawns agents to research topics on the internet. (2) With just **3 lines of code**, Judgeval captures all environment responses across all agent tool calls for monitoring. (3) After completion, (4) export all interaction data to enable further environment-specific learning and optimization.

## üõ†Ô∏è Installation

Get started with Judgeval by installing our SDK using pip:

```bash
pip install judgeval
```

Ensure you have your `JUDGMENT_API_KEY` and `JUDGMENT_ORG_ID` environment variables set to connect to the [Judgment Platform](https://app.judgmentlabs.ai/).

```bash
export JUDGMENT_API_KEY=...
export JUDGMENT_ORG_ID=...
```

**If you don't have keys, [create an account](https://app.judgmentlabs.ai/register) on the platform!**
