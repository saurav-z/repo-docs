## Key Features of Judgeval

*   **Evaluation:** Build custom evaluators using LLM-as-a-judge, manual labeling, or code-based metrics.  Integrate with our metric-tracking infrastructure for comprehensive assessment.
    *   Useful for: Unit-testing, A/B testing, and implementing online guardrails.
    <p align="center"><img src="assets/test.png" alt="Evaluation metrics" width="800"/></p>
*   **Monitoring:** Receive alerts for agent failures and identify performance degradation early. Visualize trends across agent versions and time.
    *   Useful for: Detecting regressions and visualizing performance trends.
    <p align="center"><img src="assets/errors.png" alt="Monitoring Dashboard" width="1200"/></p>
*   **Datasets:** Export agent-environment interactions to datasets for in-depth analysis and optimization. Seamlessly manage and move data to various formats (Parquet, S3, etc.)
    *   Useful for: Optimizing agent behavior and enabling scaled analysis for A/B testing.

**[Multi-Agent System](https://github.com/JudgmentLabs/judgment-cookbook/tree/main/cookbooks/agents/multi-agent) with complete observability:** (1) A multi-agent system spawns agents to research topics on the internet. (2) With just **3 lines of code**, Judgeval captures all environment responses across all agent tool calls for monitoring. (3) After completion, (4) export all interaction data to enable further environment-specific learning and optimization.
