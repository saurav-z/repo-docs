# CSrankings: The Premier Metrics-Based Ranking of Computer Science Schools

**Discover the top computer science schools worldwide, ranked using a data-driven, metrics-based approach that focuses on faculty research output.**  This project offers a transparent and reliable method for evaluating the research performance of computer science departments.

Explore the project directly on [GitHub](https://github.com/emeryberger/CSrankings).

## Key Features:

*   **Metrics-Driven Ranking:** Rankings are based on faculty publications at top computer science conferences, offering a data-driven approach.
*   **Avoids Survey-Based Bias:**  Unlike rankings based on surveys, this approach provides a more objective assessment.
*   **Difficult-to-Game Metrics:** The focus on publications in highly selective conferences makes the ranking more resistant to manipulation.
*   **Comprehensive Data Source:** Leverages the DBLP database for publication data.
*   **Community-Driven:** Open-source project with opportunities for community contributions to data and improvements.
*   **Quarterly Updates:**  The rankings are updated quarterly to reflect the latest research output.

## How it Works

The CSrankings project assesses computer science departments by analyzing the publications of their faculty members in leading computer science conferences. This approach aims to provide a reliable and objective measure of research productivity.
