# CSrankings: Your Definitive Guide to Top Computer Science Schools

**Looking to discover the leading computer science programs globally?** CSrankings provides a data-driven, metrics-based ranking of computer science departments and faculty, focusing on research productivity. [Explore the original repository here](https://github.com/emeryberger/CSrankings).

## Key Features

*   **Metrics-Driven Ranking:**  Unlike survey-based rankings, CSrankings relies on objective metrics, specifically publications at top computer science conferences, to assess research performance.
*   **Difficult-to-Game Methodology:** The ranking system prioritizes publications in highly selective conferences, making it harder to manipulate compared to citation-based approaches.
*   **Comprehensive Data:** The rankings are built upon extensive data and are regularly updated.
*   **Open Source:** Contribute and help improve the rankings.

## How CSrankings Works

This ranking system uses a metrics-based approach to identify institutions and faculty actively engaged in research across various computer science fields. It measures the number of publications by faculty appearing at the most selective conferences in each area of computer science. For more detailed information, please refer to the [FAQ](https://csrankings.org/faq.html).
