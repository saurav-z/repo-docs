# CS Rankings: A Data-Driven Ranking of Top Computer Science Schools

**CS Rankings** offers a transparent and metrics-based evaluation of computer science programs worldwide, focusing on research output at top-tier conferences. Check out the [original repository](https://github.com/emeryberger/CSrankings) for more details.

## Key Features

*   **Metrics-Based Ranking:**  Uses publication counts in top computer science conferences, providing a data-driven and objective assessment.
*   **Transparent Methodology:** Employs a methodology designed to be difficult to manipulate, contrasting with survey-based approaches.
*   **Focus on Research Excellence:** Highlights institutions and faculty actively engaged in cutting-edge computer science research.
*   **Open Source & Community Driven:**  This project welcomes contributions from the community to add and maintain faculty affiliations and information.

## How CS Rankings Works

Unlike rankings that rely on surveys, CS Rankings focuses on the number of publications by faculty at the most selective conferences in computer science. This approach aims to provide a more objective measure of research productivity and impact.

## Contributing

Contributions to CS Rankings are welcome! You can submit pull requests to modify the data. See the [CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md) file for detailed instructions on how to contribute.  Updates are processed on a quarterly basis.

## Setting Up Locally

To run CS Rankings locally, you'll need to download the DBLP data, rebuild the databases, and install a set of dependencies.  Detailed instructions are provided in the original README.
