# CS Rankings: Your Definitive Guide to Top Computer Science Schools

**Discover the leading computer science institutions and faculty worldwide with the data-driven and metrics-based CS Rankings.**  ([Original Repository](https://github.com/emeryberger/CSrankings))

## Key Features:

*   **Metrics-Driven Ranking:** Unlike rankings based on surveys, CS Rankings uses a purely metrics-based approach, focusing on publications in top computer science conferences to identify leading institutions and faculty.
*   **Objective Evaluation:**  Avoids the subjectivity of survey-based rankings by analyzing the number of publications by faculty in the most selective computer science conferences.
*   **Difficult-to-Game Approach:**  Focuses on publications in highly selective conferences, making the ranking resistant to manipulation.
*   **Community-Driven:** Actively maintained and improved with community contributions for accuracy and comprehensiveness.
*   **Comprehensive Data Source:** Leverages data from DBLP (Digital Bibliography & Library Project) for a wide-ranging and up-to-date analysis.
