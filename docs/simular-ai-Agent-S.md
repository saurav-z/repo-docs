# Agent S: Empowering AI to Use Computers Like Humans

Agent S is an open-source framework that empowers AI agents to interact with computers through a human-like interface, enabling autonomous task execution.  Explore the [original repository](https://github.com/simular-ai/Agent-S) for the latest updates and contributions.

*   **Compositional Generalist-Specialist Framework:** Agent S is built upon a framework that is specifically designed for computer use agents.
*   **Advanced Performance:**  Achieves state-of-the-art results in benchmarks such as OSWorld, WindowsAgentArena, and AndroidWorld, surpassing existing solutions.
*   **Open Source & Accessible:**  Leverage a robust and adaptable framework designed for AI research, automation, and agent-based systems.
*   **Modular Design:** Supports flexible integration and customization for diverse use cases.
*   **API & CLI Support:**  Offers both command-line interface and SDK functionality for ease of use and integration.
*   **Web Knowledge Retrieval:**  Integrates with Perplexica for enhanced information access and task completion.

## Key Features

*   **Autonomous Computer Interaction:** Enables AI agents to perform complex tasks on computers.
*   **High Performance:** Achieves state-of-the-art (SOTA) results in OSWorld, WindowsAgentArena, and AndroidWorld benchmarks.
*   **Modular Design:** Facilitates customization and extensibility.
*   **Easy to Use:** Provides both a command-line interface (CLI) and an SDK.
*   **Web Search Integration:** Includes web search capabilities via Perplexica.
*   **Multi-Platform Support:** Supports Mac, Linux, and Windows operating systems.
*   **Model Agnostic:** Supports various LLM providers through a unified interface.
