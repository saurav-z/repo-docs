## Quick Start for Readers:

```bash
# Read online
open https://mlsysbook.ai
# Download PDF
curl -O https://mlsysbook.ai/Machine-Learning-Systems.pdf
```

## Quick Start for Contributors:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/harvard-edge/cs249r_book.git
cd cs249r_book
./binder setup       # Setup environment and dependencies
./binder doctor      # Check system health
./binder preview intro # Preview chapter development
./binder build       # Build complete book (HTML)
./binder help       # See all commands
```

## Development:

### Book Binder CLI (Recommended)

The **Book Binder** simplifies the build process.

```bash
./binder preview intro                # Preview a single chapter
./binder build                        # Build complete website (HTML)
./binder pdf                          # Build complete PDF
./binder clean                        # Clean artifacts
./binder doctor                       # Run health check
./binder help                         # Show all commands
```
