The **Book Binder** offers a fast development CLI for streamlined building and iteration:

```bash
# Fast chapter development
./binder build intro html             # Build single chapter
./binder build intro,ml_systems html  # Build multiple chapters together
./binder preview intro                # Build and preview chapter

# Full book building
./binder build * html                 # Build complete website
./binder build * pdf                  # Build complete PDF

# Management
./binder clean                    # Clean artifacts
./binder status                   # Show current status
./binder help                     # Show all commands
```

### Make Commands (Traditional)

```bash
# Building
make build          # Build HTML version
make build-pdf      # Build PDF version
make preview        # Start development server

# Quality Control
make clean          # Clean build artifacts
make test           # Run validation tests
