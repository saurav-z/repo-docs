## Hugging Face Transformers: Powering the Future of AI

**Harness the power of state-of-the-art AI with the Hugging Face Transformers library, a comprehensive toolkit for cutting-edge machine learning models.** This library provides easy access to pre-trained models and tools for a wide range of tasks. [Explore the original repo](https://github.com/huggingface/transformers).

### Key Features

*   **Versatile Model Support:** Access a vast collection of pre-trained models across text, computer vision, audio, video, and multimodal domains.
*   **Easy-to-Use API:** Simplify your workflows with a unified API designed for both inference and training.
*   **Extensive Pre-trained Checkpoints:** Leverage over 1 million pre-trained checkpoints on the Hugging Face Hub to reduce training time and costs.
*   **Cross-Framework Compatibility:** Seamlessly integrate models with popular frameworks like PyTorch, TensorFlow, and Flax.
*   **Customization & Flexibility:** Easily adapt models to your specific needs with customizable options and comprehensive examples.
*   **Community-Driven:** Benefit from a vibrant community of developers and researchers contributing to the library's growth.

### Core Functionality

<h3 align="center">
    <img src="https://huggingface.co/datasets/huggingface/documentation-images/resolve/main/transformers/transformers_as_a_model_definition.png"/>
</h3>

Transformers acts as the model-definition framework for state-of-the-art machine learning models in text, computer
vision, audio, video, and multimodal model, for both inference and training.

It centralizes the model definition so that this definition is agreed upon across the ecosystem. `transformers` is the
pivot across frameworks: if a model definition is supported, it will be compatible with the majority of training
frameworks (Axolotl, Unsloth, DeepSpeed, FSDP, PyTorch-Lightning, ...), inference engines (vLLM, SGLang, TGI, ...),
and adjacent modeling libraries (llama.cpp, mlx, ...) which leverage the model definition from `transformers`.

We pledge to help support new state-of-the-art models and democratize their usage by having their model definition be
simple, customizable, and efficient.

There are over 1M+ Transformers [model checkpoints](https://huggingface.co/models?library=transformers&sort=trending) on the [Hugging Face Hub](https://huggingface.com/models) you can use.

Explore the [Hub](https://huggingface.com/) today to find a model and use Transformers to help you get started right away.

### Installation

Install the library with Python 3.9+ and support for PyTorch 2.1+, TensorFlow 2.6+, and Flax 0.4.1+.

**Using venv (Recommended)**

```bash
python -m venv .my-env
source .my-env/bin/activate
pip install "transformers[torch]"
```

**Using uv (Fast Package Manager)**

```bash
uv venv .my-env
source .my-env/bin/activate
uv pip install "transformers[torch]"
```

**Install from Source (For Latest Changes)**

```bash
git clone https://github.com/huggingface/transformers.git
cd transformers
pip install .[torch]
# or
uv pip install .[torch]
```

### Quickstart

Get started with Transformers using the [`pipeline`](https://huggingface.co/docs/transformers/pipeline_tutorial) API for text, audio, vision, and multimodal tasks.

```python
from transformers import pipeline

pipeline = pipeline(task="text-generation", model="Qwen/Qwen2.5-1.5B")
pipeline("the secret to baking a really good cake is ")
[{'generated_text': 'the secret to baking a really good cake is 1) to use the right ingredients and 2) to follow the recipe exactly. the recipe for the cake is as follows: 1 cup of sugar, 1 cup of flour, 1 cup of milk, 1 cup of butter, 1 cup of eggs, 1 cup of chocolate chips. if you want to make 2 cakes, how much sugar do you need? To make 2 cakes, you will need 2 cups of sugar.'}]
```

Use the same pattern for chatting. Construct a chat history between you and the system.

```python
import torch
from transformers import pipeline

chat = [
    {"role": "system", "content": "You are a sassy, wise-cracking robot as imagined by Hollywood circa 1986."},
    {"role": "user", "content": "Hey, can you tell me any fun things to do in New York?"}
]

pipeline = pipeline(task="text-generation", model="meta-llama/Meta-Llama-3-8B-Instruct", dtype=torch.bfloat16, device_map="auto")
response = pipeline(chat, max_new_tokens=512)
print(response[0]["generated_text"][-1]["content"])
```

### Why Use Transformers?

*   **Ease of Use:** Get started quickly with state-of-the-art models for various tasks.
*   **Cost-Effective:** Leverage pre-trained models to reduce compute costs and time.
*   **Flexibility:** Train, evaluate, and deploy models across different frameworks.
*   **Customization:** Easily adapt models to fit your unique requirements.

### Why Not Use Transformers?

*   **Not a Modular Toolbox:** The library is focused on model definitions, not a modular building block approach.
*   **Training API Focus:** The training API is optimized for PyTorch models from Transformers; use other libraries for generic machine learning loops.
*   **Example Scripts:** Example scripts may require adaptation for specific use cases.
