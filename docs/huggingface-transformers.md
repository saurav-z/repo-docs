## Installation

Transformers works with Python 3.9+ [PyTorch](https://pytorch.org/get-started/locally/) 2.1+, [TensorFlow](https://www.tensorflow.org/install/pip) 2.6+, and [Flax](https://flax.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) 0.4.1+.

Create and activate a virtual environment with [venv](https://docs.python.org/3/library/venv.html) or [uv](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/), a fast Rust-based Python package and project manager.

```py
# venv
python -m venv .my-env
source .my-env/bin/activate
# uv
uv venv .my-env
source .my-env/bin/activate
```

Install Transformers in your virtual environment.

```py
# pip
pip install "transformers[torch]"

# uv
uv pip install "transformers[torch]"
```

Install Transformers from source if you want the latest changes in the library or are interested in contributing. However, the *latest* version may not be stable. Feel free to open an [issue](https://github.com/huggingface/transformers/issues) if you encounter an error.

```shell
git clone https://github.com/huggingface/transformers.git
cd transformers

# pip
pip install .[torch]

# uv
uv pip install .[torch]
```

## Quickstart

Get started with Transformers right away with the [Pipeline](https://huggingface.co/docs/transformers/pipeline_tutorial) API. The `Pipeline` is a high-level inference class that supports text, audio, vision, and multimodal tasks. It handles preprocessing the input and returns the appropriate output.

Instantiate a pipeline and specify model to use for text generation. The model is downloaded and cached so you can easily reuse it again. Finally, pass some text to prompt the model.

```py
from transformers import pipeline

pipeline = pipeline(task="text-generation", model="Qwen/Qwen2.5-1.5B")
pipeline("the secret to baking a really good cake is ")
[{'generated_text': 'the secret to baking a really good cake is 1) to use the right ingredients and 2) to follow the recipe exactly. the recipe for the cake is as follows: 1 cup of sugar, 1 cup of flour, 1 cup of milk, 1 cup of butter, 1 cup of eggs, 1 cup of chocolate chips. if you want to make 2 cakes, how much sugar do you need? To make 2 cakes, you will need 2 cups of sugar.'}]
```

To chat with a model, the usage pattern is the same. The only difference is you need to construct a chat history (the input to `Pipeline`) between you and the system.

> [!TIP]
> You can also chat with a model directly from the command line.
> ```shell
> transformers chat Qwen/Qwen2.5-0.5B-Instruct
> ```

```py
import torch
from transformers import pipeline

chat = [
    {"role": "system", "content": "You are a sassy, wise-cracking robot as imagined by Hollywood circa 1986."},
    {"role": "user", "content": "Hey, can you tell me any fun things to do in New York?"}
]

pipeline = pipeline(task="text-generation", model="meta-llama/Meta-Llama-3-8B-Instruct", torch_dtype=torch.bfloat16, device_map="auto")
response = pipeline(chat, max_new_tokens=512)
print(response[0]["generated_text"][-1]["content"])
```

Expand the examples below to see how `Pipeline` works for different modalities and tasks.

## Why use Transformers?

*   **Ease of Use:** Leverage state-of-the-art models with an intuitive and accessible API.
*   **Efficiency & Cost Savings:**  Reduce compute costs and carbon footprint by using pre-trained models.
*   **Framework Flexibility:** Train and deploy models across multiple frameworks.
*   **Customization:** Adapt models to your specific needs.

## Why might you *not* use Transformers?

*   **Not a Modular Toolbox:**  The library prioritizes direct model access, and isn't designed as a library of neural network building blocks.
*   **Training API Focus:** While simple, the training API is optimized for PyTorch models provided by Transformers and may not be a fit for all ML loops.
*   **Example Scripts:** The examples are good starting points, but may require modification.
