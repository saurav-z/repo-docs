  RLinf: The Open-Source Reinforcement Learning Infrastructure for Agentic AI
</h1>

RLinf is an innovative, open-source infrastructure that empowers researchers and developers to fine-tune and train cutting-edge foundation models using reinforcement learning techniques. ðŸš€ Explore the power of RLinf and unlock new possibilities in agentic AI.

## Key Features

*   **Macro-to-Micro Flow (M2Flow):** This novel paradigm decouples logical workflow construction from physical communication and scheduling, enabling flexible and efficient execution.

*   **Flexible Execution Modes:**
    *   **Collocated Mode:** Shares all GPUs across all workers.
    *   **Disaggregated Mode:** Enables fine-grained pipelining.
    *   **Hybrid Mode:** A customizable combination for optimal performance.

*   **Automated Scheduling:** Automatically selects the most suitable execution mode, eliminating the need for manual resource allocation.

*   **Embodied Agent Support:**
    *   Supports popular VLA models: OpenVLA, OpenVLA-OFT, and Ï€â‚€.
    *   Integrates with mainstream CPU & GPU-based simulators: ManiSkill3, LIBERO.
    *   Enables RL fine-tuning of the Ï€â‚€ model family with flow-matching action experts.

*   **High Performance:**
    *   Hybrid mode with fine-grained pipelining delivers **120%+** throughput improvements.
    *   Automatic online scaling strategies offer 20â€“40% gains, with GPU switching in seconds.

*   **Easy to Use:**
    *   Multiple Backend Integrations: FSDP + Hugging Face (beginner-friendly) and Megatron + SGLang (expert-focused).
    *   Asynchronous communication channels.
    *   Built-in support for popular RL algorithms: PPO, GRPO, DAPO, Reinforce++, and more.

## What's New!

*   [2025/08] RLinf is open-sourced. The formal v0.1 will be released soon. The paper [RLinf: Flexible and Efficient Large-scale Reinforcement Learning via Macro-to-Micro Flow Transformation]() will also be released accordingly.
