# RLinf: Revolutionizing Agentic AI with Scalable Reinforcement Learning

**RLinf is a cutting-edge, open-source infrastructure designed to accelerate post-training of foundation models through reinforcement learning, enabling the development of next-generation AI.** (Read the full documentation [here](https://rlinf.readthedocs.io/en/latest/)). For more information, visit the [original repository](https://github.com/RLinf/RLinf).

## Key Features & Benefits

*   **Macro-to-Micro Flow (M2Flow) Paradigm:** This innovative approach decouples logical workflow design (programmable) from physical communication and scheduling (efficiency), providing flexibility and performance.
*   **Flexible Execution Modes:** Supports Collocated, Disaggregated, and Hybrid modes for optimal resource utilization.
*   **Intelligent Auto-Scheduling:** Automatically selects the best execution mode for your workload, eliminating manual configuration.
*   **Embodied Agent Support:**
    *   Fast adaptation for popular VLA models ([OpenVLA](https://github.com/openvla/openvla), [OpenVLA-OFT](https://github.com/moojink/openvla-oft), and [π₀](https://github.com/Physical-Intelligence/openpi)).
    *   Integration with mainstream CPU & GPU-based simulators ([ManiSkill3](https://github.com/haosulab/ManiSkill), [LIBERO](https://github.com/Lifelong-Robot-Learning/LIBERO)).
    *   Enables RL fine-tuning of the $\pi_0$ model family with a flow-matching action expert.
*   **High Performance:**
    *   Hybrid mode with fine-grained pipelining delivers **120%+** throughput improvement.
    *   Automatic Online Scaling Strategy provides dynamic resource scaling, with GPU switching in seconds and 20-40% more efficiency.
*   **Versatile Backend Integrations:**
    *   FSDP + Hugging Face: Ideal for fast prototyping and adapting new models.
    *   Megatron + SGLang: Optimized for large-scale training, maximizing efficiency.
*   **Adaptive Communication:** Utilizes an asynchronous communication channel for efficient data transfer.
*   **Built-in RL Methods:** Supports popular algorithms such as PPO, GRPO, DAPO, Reinforce++, and more.
