  RLinf: Powering Agentic AI with Scalable Reinforcement Learning Infrastructure
</h1>

**RLinf is your key to unlocking the potential of reinforcement learning for next-generation AI, offering a flexible, efficient, and scalable infrastructure.**  This open-source platform, built for post-training foundation models, provides a robust backbone for continuous learning, generalization, and the limitless possibilities of intelligent systems.  Explore the capabilities of RLinf and discover how it can help you build advanced AI agents.  For more details, see the [original repository](https://github.com/RLinf/RLinf).

## Key Features

RLinf distinguishes itself with its innovative features:

*   **Macro-to-Micro Flow (M2Flow):** A new paradigm decoupling logical workflow construction (programmable) from physical communication and scheduling (efficiency) for efficient and flexible RL training.
*   **Flexible Execution Modes:**
    *   **Collocated Mode:** Utilizes all GPUs across all workers.
    *   **Disaggregated Mode:** Enables fine-grained pipelining for optimal performance.
    *   **Hybrid Mode:** Customizable combination of collocated and disaggregated modes for tailored resource utilization.
*   **Auto-scheduling Strategy:** Automatically selects the most efficient execution mode based on training workload, minimizing manual configuration.
*   **Embodied Agent Support:**
    *   Fast adaptation support for popular VLA models, including [OpenVLA](https://github.com/openvla/openvla), [OpenVLA-OFT](https://github.com/moojink/openvla-oft), and [π₀](https://github.com/Physical-Intelligence/openpi).
    *   Compatibility with mainstream CPU & GPU-based simulators via standardized RL interfaces: [ManiSkill3](https://github.com/haosulab/ManiSkill), [LIBERO](https://github.com/Lifelong-Robot-Learning/LIBERO).
    *   Facilitates the first RL fine-tuning of the π₀ model family with a flow-matching action expert.
*   **Performance Advantages:**
    *   Hybrid mode with fine-grained pipelining achieves a **120%+** throughput improvement compared to other frameworks.
    *   Automatic Online Scaling Strategy dynamically scales training resources, with GPU switching completed within seconds, boosting efficiency by 20–40% while preserving the on-policy nature of RL algorithms.
*   **Ease of Use & Integration:**
    *   Multiple Backend Integrations for diverse needs: FSDP + Hugging Face and Megatron + SGLang.
    *   Adaptive communication via an asynchronous communication channel.
    *   Built-in support for popular RL methods, including [PPO](https://arxiv.org/abs/1707.06347), [GRPO](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.03300), [DAPO](https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.14476), [Reinforce++](https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.03262), and more.
