# RLinf: Unleash the Power of Reinforcement Learning for Agentic AI

**RLinf** is a cutting-edge, open-source infrastructure designed to revolutionize the training of post-training foundation models via reinforcement learning, offering unparalleled flexibility, scalability, and speed. [Explore the RLinf repository](https://github.com/RLinf/RLinf).

## Key Features of RLinf

*   **Macro-to-Micro Flow (M2Flow) Paradigm:** Decouples logical workflow construction from physical communication and scheduling, enabling efficient and programmable workflow management.
*   **Flexible Execution Modes:** Supports collocated, disaggregated, and hybrid modes for optimized resource utilization.
*   **Automated Scheduling:** Dynamically selects the optimal execution mode based on the training workload, eliminating manual resource allocation.
*   **Embodied Agent Support:**
    *   Rapid adaptation support for leading VLA models ([OpenVLA](https://github.com/openvla/openvla), [OpenVLA-OFT](https://github.com/moojink/openvla-oft), and [π₀](https://github.com/Physical-Intelligence/openpi)).
    *   Standardized RL interfaces for mainstream CPU & GPU-based simulators ([ManiSkill3](https://github.com/haosulab/ManiSkill), [LIBERO](https://github.com/Lifelong-Robot-Learning/LIBERO)).
    *   Enables the first RL fine-tuning of the $\pi_0$ model family with a flow-matching action expert.
*   **High Performance:**
    *   Hybrid mode with fine-grained pipelining achieves **120%+** throughput improvements compared to other frameworks.
    *   Dynamic Online Scaling Strategy increases efficiency by 20-40% while preserving the on-policy nature of RL algorithms, with GPU switching completed in seconds.
*   **Versatile Backend Integrations:**
    *   FSDP + Hugging Face: Ideal for rapid adaptation, fast prototyping, and easy access to new models and algorithms.
    *   Megatron + SGLang: Optimized for large-scale training, ensuring maximum efficiency for demanding workloads.
*   **Adaptive Communication:** Utilizes an asynchronous communication channel.
*   **Built-in RL Methods:** Supports popular methods like [PPO](https://arxiv.org/abs/1707.06347), [GRPO](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.03300), [DAPO](https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.14476), and [Reinforce++](https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.03262).
