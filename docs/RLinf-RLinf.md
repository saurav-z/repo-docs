# RLinf: Powering the Next Generation of Agentic AI with Flexible and Efficient Reinforcement Learning

RLinf is a cutting-edge, open-source infrastructure that revolutionizes the training of post-training foundation models using reinforcement learning.  This project focuses on providing a robust and scalable platform for advanced AI development.  Explore the code on [GitHub](https://github.com/RLinf/RLinf) and discover how RLinf can elevate your projects!

## Key Features:

*   **Macro-to-Micro Flow (M2Flow):** Decouples logical workflow construction from physical execution for enhanced efficiency and programmability.
*   **Flexible Execution Modes:** Supports collocated, disaggregated, and hybrid modes with automatic scheduling for optimal resource utilization.
*   **Auto-scheduling Strategy:**  Dynamically adapts to training workloads, eliminating manual resource allocation.
*   **Embodied Agent Support:**
    *   Seamless integration with mainstream VLA models (OpenVLA, OpenVLA-OFT, π₀, π₀.₅).
    *   Supports popular CPU & GPU-based simulators via standardized RL interfaces (ManiSkill3, LIBERO).
    *   Enables RL fine-tuning of the $\pi_0$ and $\pi_{0.5}$ model family with a flow-matching action expert.
*   **High-Performance Training:**  Achieves up to a **120%+** throughput improvement via hybrid mode and fine-grained pipelining and  20–40% further improvement with automatic online scaling.
*   **Multiple Backend Integrations:**
    *   FSDP + Hugging Face: Easy model and algorithm adaptation.
    *   Megatron + SGLang: Optimized for large-scale training.
*   **Asynchronous Communication:** Provides adaptive communication for improved efficiency.
*   **Built-in RL Methods:** Supports popular RL algorithms like PPO, GRPO, DAPO, Reinforce++, and more.

## What's New

*   **[2025/09]** The paper [RLinf: Flexible and Efficient Large-scale Reinforcement Learning via Macro-to-Micro Flow Transformation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.15965) is released.
*   **[2025/08]** RLinf is open-sourced. The formal v0.1 will be released soon.
