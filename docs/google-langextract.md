## Introduction

LangExtract is a Python library that utilizes the power of large language models (LLMs) to extract structured information from unstructured text documents. This can include clinical notes, reports, or any text where you need to identify and organize key details. LangExtract extracts the key details while ensuring the extracted data corresponds to the source text.

## Why Use LangExtract?

LangExtract offers several advantages:

1.  **Precise Source Grounding:** Easily verify extractions by mapping them back to the original text.
2.  **Reliable Structured Outputs:** Get consistent and predictable results, thanks to few-shot examples and controlled generation in supported models like Gemini.
3.  **Optimized for Long Documents:** Efficiently process large documents by using chunking, parallel processing, and multiple passes.
4.  **Interactive Visualization:** Visualize and review extractions in an interactive HTML file.
5.  **Flexible LLM Support:** Works with cloud-based models (Gemini, OpenAI) and local open-source models through the Ollama interface.
6.  **Adaptable to Any Domain:** Tailor the extraction to your specific needs with a few examples. No model fine-tuning is required.
7.  **Leverages LLM Knowledge:**  Use precise prompt wording and few-shot examples to influence how the extraction task may utilize LLM knowledge.

## Quick Start

> **Note:** Using cloud-hosted models (Gemini, OpenAI) requires an API key. See the [API Key Setup](#api-key-setup-for-cloud-models) section.

Extract structured information from text in just a few lines of code:

### 1. Define Your Extraction Task

First, create a prompt that describes what you want to extract. Then, provide a high-quality example to guide the model.

```python
import langextract as lx
import textwrap

# 1. Define the prompt and extraction rules
prompt = textwrap.dedent("""\
    Extract characters, emotions, and relationships in order of appearance.
    Use exact text for extractions. Do not paraphrase or overlap entities.
    Provide meaningful attributes for each entity to add context.""")

# 2. Provide a high-quality example to guide the model
examples = [
    lx.data.ExampleData(
        text="ROMEO. But soft! What light through yonder window breaks? It is the east, and Juliet is the sun.",
        extractions=[
            lx.data.Extraction(
                extraction_class="character",
                extraction_text="ROMEO",
                attributes={"emotional_state": "wonder"}
            ),
            lx.data.Extraction(
                extraction_class="emotion",
                extraction_text="But soft!",
                attributes={"feeling": "gentle awe"}
            ),
            lx.data.Extraction(
                extraction_class="relationship",
                extraction_text="Juliet is the sun",
                attributes={"type": "metaphor"}
            ),
        ]
    )
]
```

### 2. Run the Extraction

Provide your input text and the prompt to the `lx.extract` function:

```python
# The input text to be processed
input_text = "Lady Juliet gazed longingly at the stars, her heart aching for Romeo"

# Run the extraction
result = lx.extract(
    text_or_documents=input_text,
    prompt_description=prompt,
    examples=examples,
    model_id="gemini-2.5-flash",
)
```

> **Model Selection**: `gemini-2.5-flash` is the recommended default, offering an excellent balance of speed, cost, and quality. For highly complex tasks requiring deeper reasoning, `gemini-2.5-pro` may provide superior results. For large-scale or production use, a Tier 2 Gemini quota is suggested to increase throughput and avoid rate limits. See the [rate-limit documentation](https://ai.google.dev/gemini-api/docs/rate-limits#tier-2) for details.
>
> **Model Lifecycle**: Note that Gemini models have a lifecycle with defined retirement dates. Users should consult the [official model version documentation](https://cloud.google.com/vertex-ai/generative-ai/docs/learn/model-versions) to stay informed about the latest stable and legacy versions.

### 3. Visualize the Results

The extractions can be saved to a `.jsonl` file and visualized.

```python
# Save the results to a JSONL file
lx.io.save_annotated_documents([result], output_name="extraction_results.jsonl", output_dir=".")

# Generate the visualization from the file
html_content = lx.visualize("extraction_results.jsonl")
with open("visualization.html", "w") as f:
    if hasattr(html_content, 'data'):
        f.write(html_content.data)  # For Jupyter/Colab
    else:
        f.write(html_content)
```

This creates an animated and interactive HTML file:

![Romeo and Juliet Basic Visualization ](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/google/langextract/main/docs/_static/romeo_juliet_basic.gif)

> **Note on LLM Knowledge Utilization:** This example demonstrates extractions that stay close to the text evidence - extracting "longing" for Lady Juliet's emotional state and identifying "yearning" from "gazed longingly at the stars." The task could be modified to generate attributes that draw more heavily from the LLM's world knowledge (e.g., adding `"identity": "Capulet family daughter"` or `"literary_context": "tragic heroine"`). The balance between text-evidence and knowledge-inference is controlled by your prompt instructions and example attributes.

### Scaling to Longer Documents

For larger texts, process entire documents directly from URLs with parallel processing and enhanced sensitivity:

```python
# Process Romeo & Juliet directly from Project Gutenberg
result = lx.extract(
    text_or_documents="https://www.gutenberg.org/files/1513/1513-0.txt",
    prompt_description=prompt,
    examples=examples,
    model_id="gemini-2.5-flash",
    extraction_passes=3,    # Improves recall through multiple passes
    max_workers=20,         # Parallel processing for speed
    max_char_buffer=1000    # Smaller contexts for better accuracy
)
```

This approach can extract hundreds of entities from full novels while maintaining high accuracy. The interactive visualization seamlessly handles large result sets, making it easy to explore hundreds of entities from the output JSONL file. **[See the full *Romeo and Juliet* extraction example â†’](https://github.com/google/langextract/blob/main/docs/examples/longer_text_example.md)** for detailed results and performance insights.

## Installation

### From PyPI

```bash
pip install langextract
```

*Recommended for most users. For isolated environments, consider using a virtual environment:*

```bash
python -m venv langextract_env
source langextract_env/bin/activate  # On Windows: langextract_env\Scripts\activate
pip install langextract
```

### From Source

LangExtract uses modern Python packaging with `pyproject.toml` for dependency management:

*Installing with `-e` puts the package in development mode, allowing you to modify the code without reinstalling.*

```bash
git clone https://github.com/google/langextract.git
cd langextract

# For basic installation:
pip install -e .

# For development (includes linting tools):
pip install -e ".[dev]"

# For testing (includes pytest):
pip install -e ".[test]"
```

### Docker

```bash
docker build -t langextract .
docker run --rm -e LANGEXTRACT_API_KEY="your-api-key" langextract python your_script.py
```

## API Key Setup for Cloud Models

When using LangExtract with cloud-hosted models (like Gemini or OpenAI), you'll need to
set up an API key. On-device models don't require an API key. For developers
using local LLMs, LangExtract offers built-in support for Ollama and can be
extended to other third-party APIs by updating the inference endpoints.

### API Key Sources

Get API keys from:

*   [AI Studio](https://aistudio.google.com/app/apikey) for Gemini models
*   [Vertex AI](https://cloud.google.com/vertex-ai/generative-ai/docs/sdks/overview) for enterprise use
*   [OpenAI Platform](https://platform.openai.com/api-keys) for OpenAI models

### Setting up API key in your environment

**Option 1: Environment Variable**

```bash
export LANGEXTRACT_API_KEY="your-api-key-here"
```

**Option 2: .env File (Recommended)**

Add your API key to a `.env` file:

```bash
# Add API key to .env file
cat >> .env << 'EOF'
LANGEXTRACT_API_KEY=your-api-key-here
EOF

# Keep your API key secure
echo '.env' >> .gitignore
```

In your Python code:
```python
import langextract as lx

result = lx.extract(
    text_or_documents=input_text,
    prompt_description="Extract information...",
    examples=[...],
    model_id="gemini-2.5-flash"
)
```

**Option 3: Direct API Key (Not Recommended for Production)**

You can also provide the API key directly in your code, though this is not recommended for production use:

```python
result = lx.extract(
    text_or_documents=input_text,
    prompt_description="Extract information...",
    examples=[...],
    model_id="gemini-2.5-flash",
    api_key="your-api-key-here"  # Only use this for testing/development
)
```

**Option 4: Vertex AI (Service Accounts)**

Use [Vertex AI](https://cloud.google.com/vertex-ai/docs/start/introduction-unified-platform) for authentication with service accounts:

```python
result = lx.extract(
    text_or_documents=input_text,
    prompt_description="Extract information...",
    examples=[...],
    model_id="gemini-2.5-flash",
    language_model_params={
        "vertexai": True,
        "project": "your-project-id",
        "location": "global"  # or regional endpoint
    }
)
```

## Adding Custom Model Providers

LangExtract supports custom LLM providers via a lightweight plugin system. You can add support for new models without changing core code.

-   Add new model support independently of the core library
-   Distribute your provider as a separate Python package
-   Keep custom dependencies isolated
-   Override or extend built-in providers via priority-based resolution

See the detailed guide in [Provider System Documentation](langextract/providers/README.md) to learn how to:

-   Register a provider with `@registry.register(...)`
-   Publish an entry point for discovery
-   Optionally provide a schema with `get_schema_class()` for structured output
-   Integrate with the factory via `create_model(...)`

## Using OpenAI Models

LangExtract supports OpenAI models (requires optional dependency: `pip install langextract[openai]`):

```python
import langextract as lx

result = lx.extract(
    text_or_documents=input_text,
    prompt_description=prompt,
    examples=examples,
    model_id="gpt-4o",  # Automatically selects OpenAI provider
    api_key=os.environ.get('OPENAI_API_KEY'),
    fence_output=True,
    use_schema_constraints=False
)
```

Note: OpenAI models require `fence_output=True` and `use_schema_constraints=False` because LangExtract doesn't implement schema constraints for OpenAI yet.

## Using Local LLMs with Ollama

LangExtract supports local inference using Ollama, allowing you to run models without API keys:

```python
import langextract as lx

result = lx.extract(
    text_or_documents=input_text,
    prompt_description=prompt,
    examples=examples,
    model_id="gemma2:2b",  # Automatically selects Ollama provider
    model_url="http://localhost:11434",
    fence_output=False,
    use_schema_constraints=False
)
```

**Quick setup:** Install Ollama from [ollama.com](https://ollama.com/), run `ollama pull gemma2:2b`, then `ollama serve`.

For detailed installation, Docker setup, and examples, see [`examples/ollama/`](examples/ollama/).
