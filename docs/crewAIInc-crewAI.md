## Getting Started

Get started with CrewAI by following the tutorial below:

[![CrewAI Getting Started Tutorial](https://img.youtube.com/vi/-kSOTtYzgEw/hqdefault.jpg)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-kSOTtYzgEw "CrewAI Getting Started Tutorial")

### Learning Resources

Master CrewAI with these courses:

*   [Multi AI Agent Systems with CrewAI](https://www.deeplearning.ai/short-courses/multi-ai-agent-systems-with-crewai/) - Fundamentals of multi-agent systems.
*   [Practical Multi AI Agents and Advanced Use Cases](https://www.deeplearning.ai/short-courses/practical-multi-ai-agents-and-advanced-use-cases-with-crewai/) - Advanced implementations.

### Understanding Flows and Crews

CrewAI offers two complementary approaches:

1.  **Crews:** AI agents working together to accomplish complex tasks through role-based collaboration.
    *   Autonomous decision-making.
    *   Dynamic task delegation.
    *   Specialized roles.
    *   Flexible problem-solving.
2.  **Flows:** Event-driven workflows for precise control.
    *   Fine-grained execution control.
    *   Secure state management.
    *   Integration with Python code.
    *   Conditional branching.

**The true power of CrewAI emerges when combining Crews and Flows.**

### Getting Started with Installation

#### 1. Installation

Ensure Python >=3.10 <3.14 is installed. CrewAI uses [UV](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/) for dependency management:

```shell
pip install crewai
```

For optional features:

```shell
pip install 'crewai[tools]'
```

#### Troubleshooting Dependencies

1.  **ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'tiktoken'**

    *   Install explicitly: `pip install 'crewai[embeddings]'`
    *   Or, for tools: `pip install 'crewai[tools]'`
2.  **Failed building wheel for tiktoken**

    *   Install Rust compiler.
    *   On Windows, verify Visual C++ Build Tools.
    *   Upgrade pip: `pip install --upgrade pip`
    *   Try pre-built wheel: `pip install tiktoken --prefer-binary`

#### 2. Setting Up Your Crew with the YAML Configuration

Create a new project:

```shell
crewai create crew <project_name>
```

Project structure:

```
my_project/
├── .gitignore
├── pyproject.toml
├── README.md
├── .env
└── src/
    └── my_project/
        ├── __init__.py

        │   └── __init__.py
        └── config/
            ├── agents.yaml
            └── tasks.yaml
```

Customize:

*   `src/my_project/config/agents.yaml` - Define agents.
*   `src/my_project/config/tasks.yaml` - Define tasks.
*   `src/my_project/crew.py` - Add logic, tools, and arguments.
*   `src/my_project/main.py` - Add custom inputs.
*   `.env` - Add environment variables.

    Review the context you got and expand each topic into a full section for a report.
    Make sure the report is detailed and contains any and all relevant information.
  expected_output: >
    A fully fledge reports with the mains topics, each with a full section of information.
    Formatted as markdown without '```'
  agent: reporting_analyst
  output_file: report.md
```

**crew.py**

```python
# src/my_project/crew.py
from crewai import Agent, Crew, Process, Task
from crewai.project import CrewBase, agent, crew, task

		return Crew(
			agents=self.agents, # Automatically created by the @agent decorator
			tasks=self.tasks, # Automatically created by the @task decorator
			process=Process.sequential,
			verbose=True,
		)
```

**main.py**

```python
#!/usr/bin/env python

import sys
from latest_ai_development.crew import LatestAiDevelopmentCrew

def run():
    """
    Run the crew.
    """
    inputs = {
        'topic': 'AI Agents'
    }
    LatestAiDevelopmentCrew().crew().kickoff(inputs=inputs)
```

#### 3. Running Your Crew

Set these environment variables in your `.env` file:

*   `OPENAI_API_KEY` (or other LLM API key)
*   `SERPER_API_KEY`

Install dependencies and run the project:

```bash
cd my_project
crewai install (Optional)
```

```bash
crewai run
```

or

```bash
python src/my_project/main.py
```

If problems, update CrewAI:

```bash
crewai update
```

### Using Crews and Flows Together

```python

```

## Connecting Your Crew to a Model

Refer to [Connect CrewAI to LLMs](https://docs.crewai.com/how-to/LLM-Connections/) for details.

## How CrewAI Compares

*   **CrewAI vs. LangGraph**: CrewAI leverages autonomous agent intelligence and precise workflow control through Crews and Flows, providing high-level orchestration and low-level customization, resulting in complex, production-grade systems.
*   **CrewAI vs. Autogen**: While Autogen excels at conversational agents, it lacks an inherent concept of process. Orchestrating agents' interactions requires additional programming, which becomes complex as the scale of tasks grows.
*   **CrewAI vs. ChatDev**: ChatDev's implementation is quite rigid. Customizations are limited and not geared towards production environments, hindering scalability and flexibility.

## Telemetry

CrewAI uses anonymous telemetry for improvement.

No data is collected regarding prompts, task descriptions, agent backstories or goals, usage of tools, API calls, responses, or any data processed by the agents, or secrets and environment variables, with the exception of the conditions mentioned.

When the `share_crew` feature is enabled, detailed data including task descriptions, agents' backstories or goals, and other specific attributes are collected to provide deeper insights while respecting user privacy. Users can disable telemetry by setting the environment variable OTEL_SDK_DISABLED to true.

Data collected includes:

- Version of CrewAI
  - So we can understand how many users are using the latest version
- Version of Python
  - So we can decide on what versions to better support
- General OS (e.g. number of CPUs, macOS/Windows/Linux)
  - So we know what OS we should focus on and if we could build specific OS related features
- Number of agents and tasks in a crew
  - So we make sure we are testing internally with similar use cases and educate people on the best practices
- Crew Process being used
  - Understand where we should focus our efforts
- If Agents are using memory or allowing delegation
  - Understand if we improved the features or maybe even drop them
- If Tasks are being executed in parallel or sequentially
  - Understand if we should focus more on parallel execution
- Language model being used
  - Improved support on most used languages
- Roles of agents in a crew
  - Understand high level use cases so we can build better tools, integrations and examples about it
- Tools names available
  - Understand out of the publicly available tools, which ones are being used the most so we can improve them

Users can opt-in to Further Telemetry, sharing the complete telemetry data by setting the `share_crew` attribute to `True` on their Crews. Enabling `share_crew` results in the collection of detailed crew and task execution data, including `goal`, `backstory`, `context`, and `output` of tasks. This enables a deeper insight into usage patterns while respecting the user's choice to share.
