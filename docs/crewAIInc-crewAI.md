    ```bash
    crewai create crew <project_name>
    ```

    This generates a project structure:

    ```
    my_project/
    ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ .gitignore
    ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ pyproject.toml
    ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ README.md
    ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ .env
    ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ src/
        ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ my_project/
            ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ __init__.py
            ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ main.py
            ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ crew.py
            ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ tools/
            ‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ custom_tool.py
            ‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ __init__.py
            ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ config/
                ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ agents.yaml
                ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ tasks.yaml
    ```

2.  Customize your project by editing these files:

    *   `src/my_project/config/agents.yaml`: Define your agents.
    *   `src/my_project/config/tasks.yaml`: Define your tasks.

            'topic': 'AI Agents'
        }
        LatestAiDevelopmentCrew().crew().kickoff(inputs=inputs)
    ```

### Running Your Crew

1.  Set up your environment variables in `.env`:

    *   `OPENAI_API_KEY=sk-...` (or other LLM API key)
    *   `SERPER_API_KEY=YOUR_KEY_HERE` (for web search)

2.  Lock dependencies:

    ```bash
    cd my_project
    crewai install
    ```

3.  Run your crew:

    ```bash
    crewai run
    ```
    or
    ```bash
    python src/my_project/main.py
    ```

## Understanding Flows and Crews

CrewAI offers two powerful, synergistic approaches:

1.  **Crews:**  Teams of autonomous AI agents designed for collaborative problem-solving.
    *   Enable natural, autonomous decision-making between agents.
    *   Facilitate dynamic task delegation and collaboration.
    *   Allow specialized roles with defined goals and expertise.
    *   Provide flexible problem-solving approaches.

2.  **Flows:** Event-driven workflows for precise control over complex automations.
    *   Provide fine-grained control over execution paths.
    *   Offer secure and consistent state management.
    *   Enable clean integration of agents with Python code.
    *   Support conditional branching for complex logic.

Combining Crews and Flows allows you to:

*   Build complex, production-grade applications.
*   Balance autonomy and control.
*   Handle sophisticated real-world scenarios.
*   Maintain clean and manageable code.

## CrewAI vs. Other Frameworks

**CrewAI's Advantage**: CrewAI combines autonomous agent intelligence with precise workflow control through its unique Crews and Flows architecture. The framework excels at both high-level orchestration and low-level customization, enabling complex, production-grade systems with granular control.

*   **LangGraph**:  LangGraph requires significant boilerplate code and complex state management. Its tight coupling with LangChain can limit flexibility.
*   **Autogen**: While Autogen excels at creating conversational agents, it lacks an inherent concept of process. Orchestrating agents' interactions requires extra programming, which grows complex with scale.
*   **ChatDev**: ChatDev has rigid implementations and limited customizations, which hinder scalability and flexibility in real-world applications.

### Using Crews and Flows Together

Leverage the power of Crews and Flows to create powerful automation pipelines.

```python
from crewai.flow.flow import Flow, listen, start, router, or_
from crewai import Crew, Agent, Task, Process
from pydantic import BaseModel

# Define structured state for precise control
class MarketState(BaseModel):
    sentiment: str = "neutral"
    confidence: float = 0.0
    recommendations: list = []

class AdvancedAnalysisFlow(Flow[MarketState]):
    @start()
    def fetch_market_data(self):
        # Demonstrate low-level control with structured state
        self.state.sentiment = "analyzing"
        return {"sector": "tech", "timeframe": "1W"}  # These parameters match the task description template

    @listen(fetch_market_data)
    def analyze_with_crew(self, market_data):
        # Show crew agency through specialized roles
        analyst = Agent(
            role="Senior Market Analyst",
            goal="Conduct deep market analysis with expert insight",
            backstory="You're a veteran analyst known for identifying subtle market patterns"
        )
        researcher = Agent(
            role="Data Researcher",
            goal="Gather and validate supporting market data",
            backstory="You excel at finding and correlating multiple data sources"
        )

        analysis_task = Task(
            description="Analyze {sector} sector data for the past {timeframe}",
            expected_output="Detailed market analysis with confidence score",
            agent=analyst
        )
        research_task = Task(
            description="Find supporting data to validate the analysis",
            expected_output="Corroborating evidence and potential contradictions",
            agent=researcher
        )

        # Demonstrate crew autonomy
        analysis_crew = Crew(
            agents=[analyst, researcher],
            tasks=[analysis_task, research_task],
            process=Process.sequential,
            verbose=True
        )
        return analysis_crew.kickoff(inputs=market_data)  # Pass market_data as named inputs

    @router(analyze_with_crew)
    def determine_next_steps(self):
        # Show flow control with conditional routing
        if self.state.confidence > 0.8:
            return "high_confidence"
        elif self.state.confidence > 0.5:
            return "medium_confidence"
        return "low_confidence"

    @listen("high_confidence")
    def execute_strategy(self):
        # Demonstrate complex decision making
        strategy_crew = Crew(
            agents=[
                Agent(role="Strategy Expert",
                      goal="Develop optimal market strategy")
            ],
            tasks=[
                Task(description="Create detailed strategy based on analysis",
                     expected_output="Step-by-step action plan")
            ]
        )
        return strategy_crew.kickoff()

    @listen(or_("medium_confidence", "low_confidence"))
    def request_additional_analysis(self):
        self.state.recommendations.append("Gather more data")
        return "Additional analysis required"
```

## Connecting Your Crew to a Model

CrewAI supports different LLMs. By default, agents use the OpenAI API. For local models, configure agents via the Ollama tool.

*Refer to the [LLM Connections](https://docs.crewai.com/how-to/LLM-Connections/) page.*

## How CrewAI Compares

CrewAI focuses on autonomous agent intelligence with precise workflow control through Crews and Flows, providing robust high-level and low-level customization.

*   **LangGraph**:  CrewAI significantly executes faster than LangGraph (see [comparison](https://github.com/crewAIInc/crewAI-examples/tree/main/Notebooks/CrewAI%20Flows%20%26%20Langgraph/QA%20Agent)) and also achieves higher evaluation scores and faster completion times ([detailed analysis](https://github.com/crewAIInc/crewAI-examples/blob/main/Notebooks/CrewAI%20Flows%20%26%20Langgraph/Coding%20Assistant/coding_assistant_eval.ipynb))
*   **Autogen**:  Limited built-in process concepts.
*   **ChatDev**: Limited customizations, not geared toward production environments.

## Telemetry

CrewAI uses anonymous telemetry to help improve the library by focusing on the most used features, integrations, and tools.

**No data is collected** regarding prompts, task descriptions, agents' backstories/goals, tool usage, API calls, or any data processed by agents.  The only exception is if the `share_crew` feature is enabled.

Collected data includes:

*   CrewAI version
*   Python version
*   General OS (e.g., macOS/Windows/Linux)
*   Number of agents/tasks in a crew
*   Crew Process being used
*   If Agents are using memory or allowing delegation
*   If Tasks are executed in parallel or sequentially
*   Language model being used
*   Roles of agents in a crew
*   Tool names available

Users can opt-in to *Further Telemetry*, sharing the complete telemetry data by setting the `share_crew` attribute to `True` on their Crews. Enabling `share_crew` results in the collection of detailed crew and task execution data, including `goal`, `backstory`, `context`, and `output` of tasks. This enables a deeper insight into usage patterns while respecting the user's choice to share.
