    Formatted as markdown without '```'
  agent: reporting_analyst
  output_file: report.md
```

*   **crew.py:**

```python
# src/my_project/crew.py
from crewai import Agent, Crew, Process, Task
from crewai.project import CrewBase, agent, crew, task
from crewai_tools import SerperDevTool
from crewai.agents.agent_builder.base_agent import BaseAgent
from typing import List

@CrewBase
class LatestAiDevelopmentCrew():
	"""LatestAiDevelopment crew"""
	agents: List[BaseAgent]
	tasks: List[Task]

	@agent
	def researcher(self) -> Agent:
		return Agent(
			config=self.agents_config['researcher'],
			verbose=True,
			tools=[SerperDevTool()]
		)

	@agent
	def reporting_analyst(self) -> Agent:
		return Agent(
			config=self.agents_config['reporting_analyst'],
			verbose=True
		)

	@task
	def research_task(self) -> Task:
		return Task(
			config=self.tasks_config['research_task'],
		)

	@task
	def reporting_task(self) -> Task:
		return Task(
			config=self.tasks_config['reporting_task'],
			output_file='report.md'
		)

	@crew
	def crew(self) -> Crew:
		"""Creates the LatestAiDevelopment crew"""
		return Crew(
			agents=self.agents, # Automatically created by the @agent decorator
			tasks=self.tasks, # Automatically created by the @task decorator
			process=Process.sequential,
			verbose=True,
		)
```

*   **main.py:**

```python
#!/usr/bin/env python
# src/my_project/main.py
import sys
from latest_ai_development.crew import LatestAiDevelopmentCrew

def run():
    """
    Run the crew.
    """
    inputs = {
        'topic': 'AI Agents'
    }
    LatestAiDevelopmentCrew().crew().kickoff(inputs=inputs)
```

### 3. Running Your Crew

*   **Environment Variables:** Set your OpenAI API key and Serper.dev API key in a `.env` file:
    ```
    OPENAI_API_KEY=sk-...
    SERPER_API_KEY=YOUR_KEY_HERE
    ```

*   **Install Dependencies:**
    ```bash
    cd my_project
    crewai install (Optional)
    ```

*   **Run:**
    ```bash
    crewai run
    ```
    or
    ```bash
    python src/my_project/main.py
    ```
*   If an error happens due to the usage of poetry, please run the following command to update your crewai package:

    ```bash
    crewai update
    ```
    You should see the output in the console and the `report.md` file should be created in the root of your project with the full final report.

*   You can use the hierarchical process, which automatically assigns a manager to the defined crew to properly coordinate the planning and execution of tasks through delegation and validation of results. [See more about the processes here](https://docs.crewai.com/core-concepts/Processes/).

## Understanding Flows and Crews

CrewAI provides two key components to build sophisticated AI applications:

1.  **Crews**: AI Agents that work together to accomplish complex tasks through role-based collaboration, including:
    *   Autonomous decision-making.
    *   Dynamic task delegation and collaboration.
    *   Specialized roles with defined goals and expertise.
    *   Flexible problem-solving.

2.  **Flows**: Event-driven workflows for precise control and real-world scenarios:
    *   Fine-grained control over execution paths.
    *   Secure, consistent state management.
    *   Integration of agents with Python code.
    *   Conditional branching with logical operators (e.g., `or_`, `and_`).

**Benefits of Combining Crews and Flows:**

*   Build complex, production-grade applications.
*   Balance autonomy with precision.
*   Handle sophisticated real-world scenarios.
*   Maintain clean, maintainable code.

### Using Crews and Flows Together

CrewAI shines when combining Crews with Flows for complex automation pipelines. Flows support logical operators like `or_` and `and_`.

```python
from crewai.flow.flow import Flow, listen, start, router, or_
from crewai import Crew, Agent, Task, Process
from pydantic import BaseModel

# Define structured state for precise control
class MarketState(BaseModel):
    sentiment: str = "neutral"
    confidence: float = 0.0
    recommendations: list = []

class AdvancedAnalysisFlow(Flow[MarketState]):
    @start()
    def fetch_market_data(self):
        # Demonstrate low-level control with structured state
        self.state.sentiment = "analyzing"
        return {"sector": "tech", "timeframe": "1W"}  # These parameters match the task description template

    @listen(fetch_market_data)
    def analyze_with_crew(self, market_data):
        # Show crew agency through specialized roles
        analyst = Agent(
            role="Senior Market Analyst",
            goal="Conduct deep market analysis with expert insight",
            backstory="You're a veteran analyst known for identifying subtle market patterns"
        )
        researcher = Agent(
            role="Data Researcher",
            goal="Gather and validate supporting market data",
            backstory="You excel at finding and correlating multiple data sources"
        )

        analysis_task = Task(
            description="Analyze {sector} sector data for the past {timeframe}",
            expected_output="Detailed market analysis with confidence score",
            agent=analyst
        )
        research_task = Task(
            description="Find supporting data to validate the analysis",
            expected_output="Corroborating evidence and potential contradictions",
            agent=researcher
        )

        # Demonstrate crew autonomy
        analysis_crew = Crew(
            agents=[analyst, researcher],
            tasks=[analysis_task, research_task],
            process=Process.sequential,
            verbose=True
        )
        return analysis_crew.kickoff(inputs=market_data)  # Pass market_data as named inputs

    @router(analyze_with_crew)
    def determine_next_steps(self):
        # Show flow control with conditional routing
        if self.state.confidence > 0.8:
            return "high_confidence"
        elif self.state.confidence > 0.5:
            return "medium_confidence"
        return "low_confidence"

    @listen("high_confidence")
    def execute_strategy(self):
        # Demonstrate complex decision making
        strategy_crew = Crew(
            agents=[
                Agent(role="Strategy Expert",
                      goal="Develop optimal market strategy")
            ],
            tasks=[
                Task(description="Create detailed strategy based on analysis",
                     expected_output="Step-by-step action plan")
            ]
        )
        return strategy_crew.kickoff()

    @listen(or_("medium_confidence", "low_confidence"))
    def request_additional_analysis(self):
        self.state.recommendations.append("Gather more data")
        return "Additional analysis required"
```

## Connecting Your Crew to a Model

CrewAI integrates with various LLMs. Agents use the OpenAI API by default. See the [LLM Connections documentation](https://docs.crewai.com/how-to/LLM-Connections/) for connection details, including local models via Ollama.

## How CrewAI Compares

**CrewAI's Advantage**: CrewAI offers a powerful combination of autonomous agent intelligence and precise workflow control with Crews and Flows.

*   **LangGraph**:  Requires significant boilerplate and complex state management.  The framework's tight coupling with LangChain can limit flexibility.
*   **Autogen**: Lacks an inherent concept of process, making orchestration complex.
*   **ChatDev**: Rigid and limited customizations.

CrewAI provides speed and higher evaluation scores. *P.S. CrewAI demonstrates significant performance advantages over LangGraph, executing 5.76x faster in certain cases like this QA task example ([see comparison](https://github.com/crewAIInc/crewAI-examples/tree/main/Notebooks/CrewAI%20Flows%20%26%20Langgraph/QA%20Agent)) while achieving higher evaluation scores with faster completion times in certain coding tasks, like in this example ([detailed analysis](https://github.com/crewAIInc/crewAI-examples/blob/main/Notebooks/CrewAI%20Flows%20%26%20Langgraph/Coding%20Assistant/coding_assistant_eval.ipynb)).*
