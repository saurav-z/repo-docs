2.  **Flows:** Implement production-ready, event-driven workflows for precise control over complex automations.  Flows provide:

    *   Fine-grained control over execution paths.
    *   Secure, consistent state management.
    *   Seamless integration of AI agents with Python code.
    *   Conditional branching for complex logic.

Combining Crews and Flows lets you:

*   Build complex, production-ready applications.
*   Balance autonomy with precise control.
*   Handle complex real-world scenarios.
*   Maintain clean and organized code.

### Getting Started with Installation

Ensure you have Python >=3.10 <3.14 installed.  CrewAI utilizes [UV](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/) for dependency management, which offers a streamlined setup and execution.

### 1. Installation

First, install CrewAI:

```shell
pip install crewai
```

For optional features including additional tools:

```shell
pip install 'crewai[tools]'
```

### Troubleshooting Dependencies

Address common issues during installation:

#### Common Issues

1.  **ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'tiktoken'**

    *   Install tiktoken explicitly: `pip install 'crewai[embeddings]'`
    *   If using embedchain or other tools: `pip install 'crewai[tools]'`
2.  **Failed building wheel for tiktoken**

    *   Ensure Rust compiler is installed (see installation steps above)
    *   For Windows: Verify Visual C++ Build Tools are installed
    *   Try upgrading pip: `pip install --upgrade pip`
    *   If issues persist, use a pre-built wheel: `pip install tiktoken --prefer-binary`

### 2. Setting Up Your Crew with the YAML Configuration

To create a new CrewAI project, run the following CLI command:

```shell
crewai create crew <project_name>
```

This creates a project folder with a standard structure.  Modify the files in the `src/my_project` folder to customize your project:

-   Modify `src/my_project/config/agents.yaml` to define your agents.
-   Modify `src/my_project/config/tasks.yaml` to define your tasks.
-   Modify `src/my_project/crew.py` to add your own logic, tools, and specific arguments.
-   Modify `src/my_project/main.py` to add custom inputs for your agents and tasks.
-   Add your environment variables into the `.env` file.

#### Example of a simple crew with a sequential process:

Instantiate your crew:

```shell
crewai create crew latest-ai-development
```

Modify the files as needed to fit your use case:

**agents.yaml**

```yaml
# src/my_project/config/agents.yaml
researcher:
  role: >
    {topic} Senior Data Researcher
  goal: >
    Uncover cutting-edge developments in {topic}
  backstory: >
    You're a seasoned researcher with a knack for uncovering the latest
    developments in {topic}. Known for your ability to find the most relevant
    information and present it in a clear and concise manner.

reporting_analyst:
  role: >
    {topic} Reporting Analyst
  goal: >
    Create detailed reports based on {topic} data analysis and research findings
  backstory: >
    You're a meticulous analyst with a keen eye for detail. You're known for
    your ability to turn complex data into clear and concise reports, making
    it easy for others to understand and act on the information you provide.
```

**tasks.yaml**

```yaml
# src/my_project/config/tasks.yaml
research_task:
  description: >
    Conduct a thorough research about {topic}
    Make sure you find any interesting and relevant information given
    the current year is 2025.
  expected_output: >
    A list with 10 bullet points of the most relevant information about {topic}
  agent: researcher

reporting_task:
  description: >
    Review the context you got and expand each topic into a full section for a report.
    Make sure the report is detailed and contains any and all relevant information.
  expected_output: >
    A fully fledge reports with the mains topics, each with a full section of information.
    Formatted as markdown without '```'
  agent: reporting_analyst
  output_file: report.md
```

**crew.py**

```python
# src/my_project/crew.py
from crewai import Agent, Crew, Process, Task
from crewai.project import CrewBase, agent, crew, task
from crewai_tools import SerperDevTool
from crewai.agents.agent_builder.base_agent import BaseAgent
from typing import List

@CrewBase
class LatestAiDevelopmentCrew():
	"""LatestAiDevelopment crew"""
	agents: List[BaseAgent]
	tasks: List[Task]

	@agent
	def researcher(self) -> Agent:
		return Agent(
			config=self.agents_config['researcher'],
			verbose=True,
			tools=[SerperDevTool()]
		)

	@agent
	def reporting_analyst(self) -> Agent:
		return Agent(
			config=self.agents_config['reporting_analyst'],
			verbose=True
		)

	@task
	def research_task(self) -> Task:
		return Task(
			config=self.tasks_config['research_task'],
		)

	@task
	def reporting_task(self) -> Task:
		return Task(
			config=self.tasks_config['reporting_task'],
			output_file='report.md'
		)

	@crew
	def crew(self) -> Crew:
		"""Creates the LatestAiDevelopment crew"""
		return Crew(
			agents=self.agents, # Automatically created by the @agent decorator
			tasks=self.tasks, # Automatically created by the @task decorator
			process=Process.sequential,
			verbose=True,
		)
```

**main.py**

```python
#!/usr/bin/env python
# src/my_project/main.py
import sys
from latest_ai_development.crew import LatestAiDevelopmentCrew

def run():
    """
    Run the crew.
    """
    inputs = {
        'topic': 'AI Agents'
    }
    LatestAiDevelopmentCrew().crew().kickoff(inputs=inputs)
```

### 3. Running Your Crew

Set your required environment variables in your `.env` file:

*   `OPENAI_API_KEY=sk-...`
*   `SERPER_API_KEY=YOUR_KEY_HERE`

Navigate to your project and lock and install dependencies:

```shell
cd my_project
crewai install (Optional)
```

Run your crew:

```bash
crewai run
```

or

```bash
python src/my_project/main.py
```

If you encounter poetry-related errors, update your CrewAI package:

```bash
crewai update
```

You should see the output in the console, and a `report.md` file will be created with the final report.

You can also utilize a hierarchical process for task coordination through delegation and result validation.

### Using Crews and Flows Together

Combine Crews and Flows to create sophisticated automation pipelines, utilizing the `or_` and `and_` logical operators with `@start`, `@listen`, and `@router` decorators.

Here’s how you can orchestrate multiple Crews within a Flow:

```python
from crewai.flow.flow import Flow, listen, start, router, or_
from crewai import Crew, Agent, Task, Process
from pydantic import BaseModel

# Define structured state for precise control
class MarketState(BaseModel):
    sentiment: str = "neutral"
    confidence: float = 0.0
    recommendations: list = []

class AdvancedAnalysisFlow(Flow[MarketState]):
    @start()
    def fetch_market_data(self):
        # Demonstrate low-level control with structured state
        self.state.sentiment = "analyzing"
        return {"sector": "tech", "timeframe": "1W"}  # These parameters match the task description template

    @listen(fetch_market_data)
    def analyze_with_crew(self, market_data):
        # Show crew agency through specialized roles
        analyst = Agent(
            role="Senior Market Analyst",
            goal="Conduct deep market analysis with expert insight",
            backstory="You're a veteran analyst known for identifying subtle market patterns"
        )
        researcher = Agent(
            role="Data Researcher",
            goal="Gather and validate supporting market data",
            backstory="You excel at finding and correlating multiple data sources"
        )

        analysis_task = Task(
            description="Analyze {sector} sector data for the past {timeframe}",
            expected_output="Detailed market analysis with confidence score",
            agent=analyst
        )
        research_task = Task(
            description="Find supporting data to validate the analysis",
            expected_output="Corroborating evidence and potential contradictions",
            agent=researcher
        )

        # Demonstrate crew autonomy
        analysis_crew = Crew(
            agents=[analyst, researcher],
            tasks=[analysis_task, research_task],
            process=Process.sequential,
            verbose=True
        )
        return analysis_crew.kickoff(inputs=market_data)  # Pass market_data as named inputs

    @router(analyze_with_crew)
    def determine_next_steps(self):
        # Show flow control with conditional routing
        if self.state.confidence > 0.8:
            return "high_confidence"
        elif self.state.confidence > 0.5:
            return "medium_confidence"
        return "low_confidence"

    @listen("high_confidence")
    def execute_strategy(self):
        # Demonstrate complex decision making
        strategy_crew = Crew(
            agents=[
                Agent(role="Strategy Expert",
                      goal="Develop optimal market strategy")
            ],
            tasks=[
                Task(description="Create detailed strategy based on analysis",
                     expected_output="Step-by-step action plan")
            ]
        )
        return strategy_crew.kickoff()

    @listen(or_("medium_confidence", "low_confidence"))
    def request_additional_analysis(self):
        self.state.recommendations.append("Gather more data")
        return "Additional analysis required"
```

## Connecting Your Crew to a Model

CrewAI integrates with various LLMs. By default, agents use the OpenAI API. You can configure agents to use local models via tools like Ollama.  Refer to the [LLM Connections documentation](https://docs.crewai.com/how-to/LLM-Connections/) for configuration details.

## How CrewAI Compares

CrewAI is superior to alternative frameworks by combining autonomous agent intelligence with precise workflow control, all while being easy to use and customizable.

*   **LangGraph:** CrewAI offers significant performance advantages, executing much faster, and achieving higher evaluation scores.  [See comparison](https://github.com/crewAIInc/crewAI-examples/tree/main/Notebooks/CrewAI%20Flows%20%26%20Langgraph/QA%20Agent) and [detailed analysis](https://github.com/crewAIInc/crewAI-examples/blob/main/Notebooks/CrewAI%20Flows%20%26%20Langgraph/Coding%20Assistant/coding_assistant_eval.ipynb).
*   **Autogen:** Autogen lacks a concept of process.  Orchestrating agent interactions requires more code, which is less scalable.
*   **ChatDev:** ChatDev's process implementation is rigid, and customization is limited.

## Telemetry

CrewAI uses anonymous telemetry to help improve the library by tracking the usage of our features and focus our efforts.
**NO data is collected** concerning prompts, task descriptions, agents' backstories or goals, usage of tools, API calls, responses, any data processed by the agents, or secrets and environment variables, with the exception of the conditions mentioned. Users can disable telemetry by setting the environment variable `OTEL_SDK_DISABLED` to true.

The data collected includes:

*   CrewAI version
*   Python version
*   General OS (e.g., number of CPUs, macOS/Windows/Linux)
*   Number of agents and tasks in a crew
*   Crew Process being used
*   If Agents are using memory or allowing delegation
*   If Tasks are being executed in parallel or sequentially
*   Language model being used
*   Roles of agents in a crew
*   Tools names available

Users can opt-in to Further Telemetry by setting the `share_crew` attribute to `True` on their Crews. Enabling `share_crew` results in the collection of detailed crew and task execution data, including `goal`, `backstory`, `context`, and `output` of tasks.
