## Getting Started with Installation

### 1. Installation

Ensure you have Python >=3.10 <3.14 installed.

Install CrewAI:

```shell
pip install crewai
```

For optional features:

```shell
pip install 'crewai[tools]'
```

### Troubleshooting Dependencies

*   **ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'tiktoken'**: `pip install 'crewai[embeddings]'` or `pip install 'crewai[tools]'`
*   **Failed building wheel for tiktoken**: Install Rust, verify Visual C++ Build Tools, try upgrading pip, or use a pre-built wheel.

### 2. Project Setup

Create a project:

```shell
crewai create crew <project_name>
```

Project structure:

```
my_project/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ .gitignore
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ pyproject.toml
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ README.md
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ .env
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ src/
    ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ my_project/
        ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ __init__.py
        ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ main.py
        ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ crew.py
        ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ tools/
        ‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ custom_tool.py
        ‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ __init__.py
        ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ config/
            ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ agents.yaml
            ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ tasks.yaml
```

Customize agents in `agents.yaml`, tasks in `tasks.yaml`, crew logic in `crew.py`, and the entry point in `main.py`.

### 3. Example:

**agents.yaml**

```yaml

## How CrewAI Compares

**CrewAI's Advantage**: Autonomous agent intelligence with precise workflow control through its unique Crews and Flows architecture.

-   **LangGraph**:
    *P.S. CrewAI demonstrates significant performance advantages over LangGraph...([see comparison](https://github.com/crewAIInc/crewAI-examples/tree/main/Notebooks/CrewAI%20Flows%20%26%20Langgraph/QA%20Agent)).*
    *...faster completion times in certain coding tasks, like in this example ([detailed analysis](https://github.com/crewAIInc/crewAI-examples/blob/main/Notebooks/CrewAI%20Flows%20%26%20Langgraph/Coding%20Assistant/coding_assistant_eval.ipynb)).*

## Telemetry

CrewAI uses anonymous telemetry to collect usage data to improve the library.

-   **NO data is collected** concerning prompts, task descriptions, agents' backstories or goals, usage of tools, API calls, responses, any data processed by the agents, or secrets and environment variables, with the exception of the conditions mentioned.
-   Telemetry can be disabled by setting the environment variable `OTEL_SDK_DISABLED` to true.
-   When `share_crew` is enabled detailed data including task descriptions, agents' backstories or goals, and other specific attributes are collected to provide deeper insights while respecting user privacy.
-   Data collected includes:
    -   Version of CrewAI
    -   Version of Python
    -   General OS
    -   Number of agents and tasks
    -   Crew Process being used
    -   If Agents are using memory or allowing delegation
    -   If Tasks are being executed in parallel or sequentially
    -   Language model being used
    -   Roles of agents in a crew
    -   Tools names available

*   Users can opt-in to Further Telemetry, sharing the complete telemetry data by setting the `share_crew` attribute to `True` on their Crews.
