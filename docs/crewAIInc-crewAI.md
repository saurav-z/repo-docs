### Installation

```bash
pip install crewai
```

For additional tools:

```bash
pip install 'crewai[tools]'
```

### Core Concepts: Crews and Flows

*   **Crews:** Create teams of autonomous AI agents that collaborate on complex tasks through role-based interactions, dynamic delegation, and true decision-making. Ideal for complex problem-solving.
*   **Flows:** Build production-ready, event-driven workflows with precise control over execution paths, consistent state management, and conditional branching. Perfect for streamlining real-world scenarios.

Combine Crews and Flows for sophisticated automation.

### Connecting Your Crew to a Model

CrewAI supports integrating with many LLMs via many connection options.

Consult the [LLM Connections documentation](https://docs.crewai.com/how-to/LLM-Connections/) for detailed configuration.

## How CrewAI Compares

CrewAI offers a superior approach to multi-agent AI:

*   **CrewAI's Advantage:** Combines autonomous agent intelligence (Crews) with precise workflow control (Flows) for high-level orchestration and granular customization.

### Comparison to other Frameworks
*   **LangGraph:** Requires significant boilerplate code and complex state management. Can limit flexibility with custom agent behaviors.
*   **Autogen:** Lacks an inherent process concept. Requires additional programming to orchestrate agent interactions.
*   **ChatDev:** Implementation is quite rigid and customizations are limited, which can hinder scalability and flexibility.

*P.S. CrewAI demonstrates significant performance advantages over LangGraph, executing 5.76x faster in certain cases like this QA task example ([see comparison](https://github.com/crewAIInc/crewAI-examples/tree/main/Notebooks/CrewAI%20Flows%20%26%20Langgraph/QA%20Agent)) while achieving higher evaluation scores with faster completion times in certain coding tasks, like in this example ([detailed analysis](https://github.com/crewAIInc/crewAI-examples/blob/main/Notebooks/CrewAI%20Flows%20%26%20Langgraph/Coding%20Assistant/coding_assistant_eval.ipynb)).*

## Telemetry

CrewAI uses anonymous telemetry.

NO data is collected concerning prompts, task descriptions, agents' backstories or goals, usage of tools, API calls, responses, any data processed by the agents, or secrets and environment variables, with the exception of the conditions mentioned. When the `share_crew` feature is enabled, detailed data including task descriptions, agents' backstories or goals, and other specific attributes are collected to provide deeper insights while respecting user privacy. Users can disable telemetry by setting the environment variable OTEL_SDK_DISABLED to true.
