```shell
pip install crewai
```

For optional features and tools:

```shell
pip install 'crewai[tools]'
```

#### Troubleshooting Dependencies

1.  **ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'tiktoken'**:

    ```shell
    pip install 'crewai[embeddings]'
    ```
    or
    ```shell
    pip install 'crewai[tools]'
    ```
2.  **Failed building wheel for tiktoken**:

    *   Ensure Rust compiler is installed.
    *   For Windows: Verify Visual C++ Build Tools are installed.

    *   If issues persist, use a pre-built wheel: `pip install tiktoken --prefer-binary`

### 2. Setting Up Your Crew with the YAML Configuration

Create a new project:

```shell
crewai create crew <project_name>
```

This generates a project structure:

```
my_project/
â”œâ”€â”€ .gitignore
â”œâ”€â”€ pyproject.toml
â”œâ”€â”€ README.md
â”œâ”€â”€ .env
â””â”€â”€ src/
    â””â”€â”€ my_project/
        â”œâ”€â”€ __init__.py
        â”œâ”€â”€ main.py
        â”œâ”€â”€ crew.py
        â”œâ”€â”€ tools/
        â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ custom_tool.py
        â”‚   â””â”€â”€ __init__.py
        â””â”€â”€ config/
            â”œâ”€â”€ agents.yaml
            â””â”€â”€ tasks.yaml
```

from typing import List

@CrewBase
class LatestAiDevelopmentCrew():
	"""LatestAiDevelopment crew"""
	agents: List[BaseAgent]
	tasks: List[Task]

	@agent
	def researcher(self) -> Agent:
		return Agent(
			config=self.agents_config['researcher'],
			verbose=True,
			tools=[SerperDevTool()]
		)

	@agent
	def reporting_analyst(self) -> Agent:
		return Agent(
			config=self.agents_config['reporting_analyst'],
			verbose=True
		)

	@task
	def research_task(self) -> Task:
		return Task(
			config=self.tasks_config['research_task'],
		)

	@task
	def reporting_task(self) -> Task:
		return Task(
			config=self.tasks_config['reporting_task'],
			output_file='report.md'
		)

	@crew
	def crew(self) -> Crew:
		"""Creates the LatestAiDevelopment crew"""
		return Crew(
			agents=self.agents, # Automatically created by the @agent decorator
			tasks=self.tasks, # Automatically created by the @task decorator
			process=Process.sequential,
			verbose=True,
		)
```

**main.py**

```python
#!/usr/bin/env python
# src/my_project/main.py
import sys
from latest_ai_development.crew import LatestAiDevelopmentCrew

def run():
    """
    Run the crew.
    """
    inputs = {
        'topic': 'AI Agents'
    }
    LatestAiDevelopmentCrew().crew().kickoff(inputs=inputs)
```

### 3. Running Your Crew

Set these environment variables in your `.env` file:

*   `OPENAI_API_KEY=sk-...`  (or other LLM API key)
*   `SERPER_API_KEY=YOUR_KEY_HERE` (for search functionality)

Navigate to your project directory:

```shell
cd my_project
```

Install dependencies (Optional):

```shell
crewai install (Optional)
```

Run your crew:

```bash
crewai run
```

or

```bash
python src/my_project/main.py
```

If you encounter errors with poetry, update the `crewai` package:

### Using Crews and Flows Together

Combine Crews and Flows to create sophisticated automation pipelines. CrewAI flows support logical operators like `or_` and `and_` to combine multiple conditions, usable with `@start`, `@listen`, or `@router`.

-   `or_`: Triggers when any of the specified conditions are met.
-   `and_`: Triggers when all of the specified conditions are met.

```python
from crewai.flow.flow import Flow, listen, start, router, or_
from crewai import Crew, Agent, Task, Process
from pydantic import BaseModel

class MarketState(BaseModel):
    sentiment: str = "neutral"
    confidence: float = 0.0
    recommendations: list = []

class AdvancedAnalysisFlow(Flow[MarketState]):
    @start()
    def fetch_market_data(self):
        self.state.sentiment = "analyzing"
        return {"sector": "tech", "timeframe": "1W"}

    @listen(fetch_market_data)
    def analyze_with_crew(self, market_data):
        analyst = Agent(
            role="Senior Market Analyst",
            goal="Conduct deep market analysis with expert insight",
            backstory="You're a veteran analyst known for identifying subtle market patterns"
        )
        researcher = Agent(
            role="Data Researcher",
            goal="Gather and validate supporting market data",
            backstory="You excel at finding and correlating multiple data sources"
        )

        analysis_task = Task(
            description="Analyze {sector} sector data for the past {timeframe}",
            expected_output="Detailed market analysis with confidence score",
            agent=analyst
        )
        research_task = Task(
            description="Find supporting data to validate the analysis",
            expected_output="Corroborating evidence and potential contradictions",
            agent=researcher
        )

        analysis_crew = Crew(
            agents=[analyst, researcher],
            tasks=[analysis_task, research_task],
            process=Process.sequential,
            verbose=True
        )
        return analysis_crew.kickoff(inputs=market_data)

    @router(analyze_with_crew)
    def determine_next_steps(self):
        if self.state.confidence > 0.8:
            return "high_confidence"
        elif self.state.confidence > 0.5:
            return "medium_confidence"
        return "low_confidence"

    @listen("high_confidence")
    def execute_strategy(self):
        strategy_crew = Crew(
            agents=[
                Agent(role="Strategy Expert",
                      goal="Develop optimal market strategy")
            ],
            tasks=[
                Task(description="Create detailed strategy based on analysis",
                     expected_output="Step-by-step action plan")
            ]
        )
        return strategy_crew.kickoff()

    @listen(or_("medium_confidence", "low_confidence"))
    def request_additional_analysis(self):
        self.state.recommendations.append("Gather more data")
        return "Additional analysis required"
```

## Connecting Your Crew to a Model

CrewAI offers flexible LLM connections.  By default, agents use the OpenAI API.  For details on alternative connections, consult the [Connect CrewAI to LLMs](https://docs.crewai.com/how-to/LLM-Connections/) documentation.

## How CrewAI Compares

**CrewAI's Advantage**: CrewAI provides both autonomous agent intelligence with its unique Crews and precise workflow control through Flows. It excels at high-level orchestration and low-level customization.

*   **LangGraph**: Requires more complex state management and code than CrewAI.  Tight coupling with LangChain can limit flexibility.

*P.S. CrewAI demonstrates significant performance advantages over LangGraph, executing 5.76x faster in certain cases like this QA task example ([see comparison](https://github.com/crewAIInc/crewAI-examples/tree/main/Notebooks/CrewAI%20Flows%20%26%20Langgraph/QA%20Agent)) while achieving higher evaluation scores with faster completion times in certain coding tasks, like in this example ([detailed analysis](https://github.com/crewAIInc/crewAI-examples/blob/main/Notebooks/CrewAI%20Flows%20%26%20Langgraph/Coding%20Assistant/coding_assistant_eval.ipynb)).*

*   **Autogen**:  Autogen lacks an inherent concept of process, which can make it difficult to orchestrate agents' interactions.
*   **ChatDev**:  ChatDev's implementation is rigid, which hinders scalability and flexibility in real-world applications.
