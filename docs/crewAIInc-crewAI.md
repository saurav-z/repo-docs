## Supercharge Your AI Automation with CrewAI: The Lightning-Fast, Standalone Framework

CrewAI is a powerful, open-source Python framework designed for orchestrating multi-agent AI systems, offering unparalleled flexibility and control.  [Explore the source code on GitHub](https://github.com/crewAIInc/crewAI).

### Key Features

*   **Standalone & Lean:** Built from scratch, independent of LangChain and other agent frameworks, resulting in faster execution and less resource consumption.
*   **Crews for Autonomy:** Easily create teams of autonomous AI agents that collaborate to solve complex problems.
*   **Flows for Precision:** Implement event-driven workflows for granular control over tasks and precise orchestration.
*   **Deep Customization:** Tailor every aspect of your AI agents, from workflows and system architecture to agent behaviors and execution logic.
*   **Production-Ready Performance:** Achieve consistent and reliable results across both simple and complex enterprise-grade scenarios.
*   **Thriving Community:** Benefit from extensive documentation and a rapidly growing community of over 100,000 certified developers offering comprehensive support and resources.

### Why Choose CrewAI?

CrewAI provides the best-in-class combination of speed, flexibility, and control for multi-agent automation:

*   **Standalone Framework:** No reliance on external agent frameworks.
*   **High Performance:** Optimized for speed and minimal resource usage.
*   **Flexible Customization:** Complete control over workflows, architecture, and agent behavior.
*   **Ideal for All Use Cases:** Proven effective for simple to complex enterprise-grade scenarios.
*   **Robust Community:** Backed by a large, supportive community.

### Getting Started

#### Installation

Make sure you have Python >=3.10 <3.14 installed on your system. CrewAI uses [UV](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/) for dependency management and package handling, offering a seamless setup and execution experience.

```bash
pip install crewai
```

To install with optional tools:

```bash
pip install 'crewai[tools]'
```

#### Troubleshooting

1.  **ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'tiktoken'**: Install with `pip install 'crewai[embeddings]'` or  `pip install 'crewai[tools]'` if using embedchain.
2.  **Failed building wheel for tiktoken**: Ensure Rust and Visual C++ Build Tools are installed. Try upgrading pip or using a pre-built wheel: `pip install tiktoken --prefer-binary`.

#### Example: Create a new CrewAI project

```bash
crewai create crew <project_name>
```

Edit the files in the `src/my_project` folder to customize your agents and tasks.

#### Run a simple crew

1.  Set API keys as environment variables in your `.env` file: `OPENAI_API_KEY=sk-...`, `SERPER_API_KEY=YOUR_KEY_HERE`.
2.  Navigate to your project directory: `cd my_project`
3.  Install and run:

```bash
crewai install  # Optional
```

```bash
crewai run
```

or

```bash
python src/my_project/main.py
```

If you get an error due to poetry, run the following command:

```bash
crewai update
```

This will produce your report.md in the root of your project.

### Understanding Flows and Crews

CrewAI offers two complementary approaches:

1.  **Crews:** Teams of autonomous AI agents working together through role-based collaboration.
    *   Natural, autonomous decision-making
    *   Dynamic task delegation
    *   Specialized roles
    *   Flexible problem-solving
2.  **Flows:** Event-driven workflows for precise control.
    *   Fine-grained control
    *   Secure state management
    *   Integration with production code
    *   Conditional branching

#### Example combining Crews and Flows
```python

### Connecting Your Crew to a Model

CrewAI supports various LLMs through connection options.  See [Connect CrewAI to LLMs](https://docs.crewai.com/how-to/LLM-Connections/) for details.

### How CrewAI Compares

CrewAI's advantage is its unique Crews and Flows architecture, excelling at both high-level orchestration and low-level customization.

*   **LangGraph:** CrewAI has significant performance advantages over LangGraph ([see comparison](https://github.com/crewAIInc/crewAI-examples/tree/main/Notebooks/CrewAI%20Flows%20%26%20Langgraph/QA%20Agent))
*   **Autogen:** Lacks an inherent concept of process.
*   **ChatDev:** Limited customizations and not geared towards production environments.
