### Using Crews and Flows Together

CrewAI flows support `or_` and `and_` operators:

*   `or_`: Triggers when any conditions are met.
*   `and_`: Triggers when all conditions are met.

Example:

```python
from crewai.flow.flow import Flow, listen, start, router, or_
from crewai import Crew, Agent, Task, Process
from pydantic import BaseModel

class MarketState(BaseModel):
    sentiment: str = "neutral"
    confidence: float = 0.0
    recommendations: list = []

class AdvancedAnalysisFlow(Flow[MarketState]):
    @start()
    def fetch_market_data(self):
        self.state.sentiment = "analyzing"
        return {"sector": "tech", "timeframe": "1W"}

    @listen(fetch_market_data)
    def analyze_with_crew(self, market_data):
        analyst = Agent(...)
        researcher = Agent(...)
        analysis_task = Task(...)
        research_task = Task(...)

        analysis_crew = Crew(...)
        return analysis_crew.kickoff(inputs=market_data)

    @router(analyze_with_crew)
    def determine_next_steps(self):
        if self.state.confidence > 0.8:
            return "high_confidence"
        elif self.state.confidence > 0.5:
            return "medium_confidence"
        return "low_confidence"

    @listen("high_confidence")
    def execute_strategy(self):
        strategy_crew = Crew(...)
        return strategy_crew.kickoff()

    @listen(or_("medium_confidence", "low_confidence"))
    def request_additional_analysis(self):
        self.state.recommendations.append("Gather more data")
        return "Additional analysis required"
```

This example demonstrates using Python code for data operations, creating Crews, using Flow decorators, and implementing conditional branching based on results.

## Connecting Your Crew to a Model

CrewAI supports various LLMs. Agents default to the OpenAI API.  You can also configure agents to use local models. See the [Connect CrewAI to LLMs](https://docs.crewai.com/how-to/LLM-Connections/) page.

## How CrewAI Compares

**CrewAI's Advantage**: CrewAI combines autonomous agent intelligence with precise workflow control through its unique Crews and Flows architecture. The framework excels at both high-level orchestration and low-level customization, enabling complex, production-grade systems with granular control.

- **LangGraph**: While LangGraph provides a foundation for building agent workflows, its approach requires significant boilerplate code and complex state management patterns. The framework's tight coupling with LangChain can limit flexibility when implementing custom agent behaviors or integrating with external systems.

*P.S. CrewAI demonstrates significant performance advantages over LangGraph, executing 5.76x faster in certain cases like this QA task example ([see comparison](https://github.com/crewAIInc/crewAI-examples/tree/main/Notebooks/CrewAI%20Flows%20%26%20Langgraph/QA%20Agent)) while achieving higher evaluation scores with faster completion times in certain coding tasks, like in this example ([detailed analysis](https://github.com/crewAIInc/crewAI-examples/blob/main/Notebooks/CrewAI%20Flows%20%26%20Langgraph/Coding%20Assistant/coding_assistant_eval.ipynb)).*

-   **Autogen**: While Autogen excels at creating conversational agents capable of working together, it lacks an inherent concept of process. In Autogen, orchestrating agents' interactions requires additional programming, which can become complex and cumbersome as the scale of tasks grows.
-   **ChatDev**: ChatDev introduced the idea of processes into the realm of AI agents, but its implementation is quite rigid. Customizations in ChatDev are limited and not geared towards production environments, which can hinder scalability and flexibility in real-world applications.
