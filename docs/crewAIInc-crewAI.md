### Using Crews and Flows Together

Orchestrate multiple Crews within a Flow.  Example:

```python
# See example for code
```

## Connecting Your Crew to a Model

Configure your agents to use various LLMs with a variety of connection options.
Explore the [Connect CrewAI to LLMs](https://docs.crewai.com/how-to/LLM-Connections/) page.

## How CrewAI Compares

**CrewAI's Advantage**: CrewAI offers autonomous agent intelligence combined with precise workflow control through its unique Crews and Flows architecture.

*   **LangGraph**: Significant boilerplate code and complex state management. Performance advantages over LangGraph, executing 5.76x faster in certain cases like this QA task example ([see comparison](https://github.com/crewAIInc/crewAI-examples/tree/main/Notebooks/CrewAI%20Flows%20%26%20Langgraph/QA%20Agent)) while achieving higher evaluation scores with faster completion times in certain coding tasks, like in this example ([detailed analysis](https://github.com/crewAIInc/crewAI-examples/blob/main/Notebooks/CrewAI%20Flows%20%26%20Langgraph/Coding%20Assistant/coding_assistant_eval.ipynb)).
*   **Autogen**: Lacks an inherent concept of process.
*   **ChatDev**: Limited customizations and not geared towards production environments.

## Telemetry

CrewAI uses anonymous telemetry.  You can disable telemetry by setting the environment variable `OTEL_SDK_DISABLED` to true. Users can opt-in to Further Telemetry, sharing the complete telemetry data by setting the `share_crew` attribute to `True` on their Crews. Enabling `share_crew` results in the collection of detailed crew and task execution data, including `goal`, `backstory`, `context`, and `output` of tasks. This enables a deeper insight into usage patterns while respecting the user's choice to share.
