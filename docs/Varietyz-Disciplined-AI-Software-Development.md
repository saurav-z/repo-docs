# Disciplined AI Software Development: A Structured Approach

This methodology provides a structured framework for developing software with AI, addressing common issues like code bloat and architectural drift.  It uses systematic constraints and behavior enforcement to promote consistency and improve development outcomes.

**Key Features:**

*   **AI Behavioral Configuration:** Define custom instructions and enforce behavioral constraints using AI-PREFERENCES.XML, ensuring consistent output.
*   **Persona Framework:** Utilize pre-built or custom personas (e.g., Guide, TechDoc, R&D) to guide AI behavior and collaboration.
*   **Collaborative Planning:** Leverage METHODOLOGY.XML to define project scope, structure, and tasks.
*   **Systematic Implementation:** Implement components systematically with file size limits (≤150 lines) for focused development.
*   **Data-Driven Iteration:** Use a benchmarking suite to measure performance and inform optimization decisions, moving away from guesswork.
*   **Project Extraction Tool:** Utilize a tool to create structured snapshots of the code base for easier code sharing and tracking architectural compliance

## The Context Problem in AI Software Development

AI systems often struggle with broad requests, leading to:

*   Unstructured, monolithic functions.
*   Code duplication across components.
*   Inconsistent architectural design.
*   Context dilution and output drift.
*   Behavioral inconsistencies over time.
*   Increased debugging time.

## How This Methodology Works

This methodology consists of four stages, each employing systematic constraints, behavioral consistency enforcement, and validation checkpoints:

**Planning saves debugging time.** Planning thoroughly upfront typically prevents days of fixing architectural issues later.

## The Four Stages

### Stage 1: AI Behavioral Configuration

Establish consistency and constraint enforcement:

1.  **Configure AI Custom Instructions:** Use [AI-PREFERENCES.XML](prompt_formats/software_development/XML/AI-PREFERENCES.XML) to set custom instructions for behavioral constraints. Utilize ⚠️ indicators to flag uncertainty.

2.  **RECOMMENDED: Load Persona Framework:**

    *   Upload [CORE-PERSONA-FRAMEWORK.json](persona/JSON/CORE-PERSONA-FRAMEWORK.json) and select a domain-appropriate persona:
        *   [GUIDE-PERSONA.json](persona/JSON/persona_plugins/GUIDE-PERSONA.json) - Methodology enforcement specialist
        *   [TECDOC-PERSONA.json](persona/JSON/persona_plugins/TECDOC-PERSONA.json) - Technical documentation specialist
        *   [R&D-PERSONA.json](persona/JSON/persona_plugins/R&D-PERSONA.json) - Research scientist with absolute code quality standards
        *   [MURMATE-PERSONA.json](persona/JSON/persona_plugins/MURMATE-PERSONA.json) - Visual systems specialist
    *   Create project-specific persona using [CREATE-PERSONA-PLUGIN.json](persona/JSON/CREATE-PERSONA-PLUGIN.json)

3.  **RECOMMENDED: Activate Persona:**
    *   Issue command: "Simulate Persona"

### Stage 2: Collaborative Planning

Share [METHODOLOGY.XML](prompt_formats/software_development/XML/METHODOLOGY.XML) with the AI to structure your project plan and collaborate to:

1.  Define the scope and completion criteria.
2.  Identify components and dependencies.
3.  Structure phases based on logical progression.
4.  Generate systematic tasks with measurable checkpoints.

Output: A development plan following dependency chains with modular boundaries.

### Stage 3: Systematic Implementation

Work phase by phase, section by section.  Each request follows: "Can you implement [specific component]?" with focused objectives.

**File Size Constraint:**  Implement components with a file size limit of ≤150 lines to:

*   Limit context windows.
*   Encourage focused implementation.
*   Simplify sharing and debugging.

**Implementation Flow:**

```
Request specific component → AI processes → Validate → Benchmark → Continue
```

### Stage 4: Data-Driven Iteration

Use the benchmarking suite (built first) to gather performance data throughout development.  Feed this data back to the AI for optimization.

## Why This Approach Works

*   **Focused Decision Processing:** AI handles focused, specific requests more reliably.
*   **Context Management:**  Smaller files and bounded problems minimize AI cognitive overload.
*   **Behavioral Constraint Enforcement:** Personas maintain consistency and prevent AI drift.
*   **Empirical Validation:**  Performance data drives decisions, replacing subjective assessment.
*   **Systematic Constraints:**  Architectural checkpoints and dependency gates force consistent behavior.

## Example Projects

*   **[Discord Bot Template](https://github.com/Varietyz/discord-js-bot-template)** - Production-ready bot foundation with plugin architecture, security, API management, and comprehensive testing.  46 files, all under 150 lines.
*   **[PhiCode Runtime](https://github.com/Varietyz/phicode-runtime)** - Programming language runtime engine with transpilation, caching, security validation, and Rust acceleration.  Complex system maintaining architectural discipline across 70+ modules.
*   **[PhiPipe](https://github.com/Varietyz/PhiPipe)** - CI/CD regression detection system with statistical analysis, GitHub integration, and concurrent processing.  Go-based service handling performance baselines and automated regression alerts.

You can compare the methodology principles to the codebase structure to see how the approach translates to working code.

## Implementation Steps

*Note: .xml format is a guideline; you should experiment with different formats (e.g., .json, .yaml, .md) for different use cases.*
*Each format emphasizes different domains. For example, .md prompts are effective for documentation: because the AI recognizes the structure, it tends to continue it naturally.*
*.xml and .json provide a code-like structure. This tends to strengthen code generation while reducing unnecessary jargon, resulting in more structured outputs.*
*Additionally, I've included some experimental prompts to illustrate differences when using less common formats or unusual practices.*
*[View Prompt Formats](prompt_formats)*

### Setup

1.  Configure AI with [AI-PREFERENCES.XML](prompt_formats/software_development/XML/AI-PREFERENCES.XML) as custom instructions.
2.  RECOMMENDED: Share [CORE-PERSONA-FRAMEWORK.json](persona/JSON/CORE-PERSONA-FRAMEWORK.json) + selected [PERSONA.json](persona/JSON/persona_plugins) (*Could potentially be placed in custom instructions*).
3.  RECOMMENDED: Issue command: "Simulate Persona".
4.  Share [METHODOLOGY.XML](prompt_formats/software_development/XML/METHODOLOGY.XML) for the planning session.
5.  Collaborate on project structure and phases.
6.  Generate a systematic development plan.

### Execution

1.  Build Phase 0 benchmarking infrastructure first.
2.  Work through phases sequentially.
3.  Implement one component per interaction.
4.  Run benchmarks and share results with the AI.
5.  Continuously validate architectural compliance.

### Quality Assurance

*   Performance regression detection
*   Architectural principle validation
*   Code duplication auditing
*   File size compliance checking
*   Dependency boundary verification

## Project State Extraction

Use the included [project extraction tool](scripts/project_extract.py) to generate structured snapshots of your codebase:

```bash
python scripts/project_extract.py
```

**Configuration Options:**

*   `SEPARATE_FILES = False`: Single [THE_PROJECT.md](scripts/output_example/THE_PROJECT.md) file (recommended for small codebases)
*   `SEPARATE_FILES = True`: Multiple files per [directory](scripts/output_example/.Project_Extraction) (recommended for large codebases and focused folder work)
*   `INCLUDE_PATHS`: Directories and files to analyze
*   `EXCLUDE_PATTERNS`: Skip cache directories, build artifacts, and generated files

**Output:**

*   Complete file contents with syntax highlighting
*   File line counts with architectural warnings (⚠️ for 140-150 lines, ‼️ for >150 lines on code files)
*   Tree structure visualization
*   Ready-to-share

*[output examples can be found here](scripts/output_example)*

Use the tool to share a complete or partial project state with the AI system, track architectural compliance, and create focused development context.

## What to Expect

*   **AI Behavior:** Reduced architectural drift and context degradation.  The Persona system maintains behavioral consistency.  Occasional reminders about principles may be needed.
*   **Development Flow:** Systematic planning often reduces debugging cycles. Focused implementation minimizes feature bloat.  Performance data supports optimization.
*   **Code Quality:** Consistent architecture, measurable performance, maintainable structure as projects scale.

# Frequently Asked Questions

## Origin & Development

<details>
<summary>What problem led you to create this methodology?</summary>

---

I kept having to restate my preferences and architectural requirements to AI systems. It didn't matter which language or project I was working on - the AI would consistently produce either bloated monolithic code or underdeveloped implementations with issues throughout.

This led me to examine the meta-principles driving code quality and software architecture. I questioned whether pattern matching in AI models might be more effective when focused on underlying software principles rather than surface-level syntax. Since pattern matching is logic-driven and machines fundamentally operate on simple question-answer pairs, I realized that functions with multiple simultaneous questions were overwhelming the system.

The breakthrough came from understanding that everything ultimately transpiles to binary - a series of "can you do this? → yes/no" decisions. This insight shaped my approach: instead of issuing commands, ask focused questions in proper context. Rather than mentally managing complex setups alone, collaborate with AI to devise systematic plans.

---

</details>

<details>
<summary>How did you discover these specific constraints work?</summary>

---

Through extensive trial and error. AI systems will always tend to drift even under constraints, but they're significantly more accurate with structured boundaries than without them. You occasionally need to remind the AI of its role to prevent deviation - like managing a well-intentioned toddler that knows the rules but sometimes pushes boundaries trying to satisfy you.

These tools are far from perfect, but they're effective instruments for software development when properly constrained.

---

</details>

<details>
<summary>What failures or frustrations shaped this approach?</summary>

---

Maintenance hell was the primary driver. I grew tired of responses filled with excessive praise: "You have found the solution!", "You have redefined the laws of physics with your paradigm-shifting script!" This verbose fluff wastes time, tokens, and patience without contributing to productive development.

Instead of venting frustration on social media about AI being "just a dumb tool," I decided to find methods that actually work. My approach may not help everyone, but I hope it benefits those who share similar AI development frustrations.

---

</details>

## Personal Practice

<details>
<summary>How consistently do you follow your own methodology?</summary>

---

Since creating the documentation, I haven't deviated. Whenever I see the model producing more lines than my methodology restricts, I immediately interrupt generation with a flag: "‼️ ARCHITECTURAL VIOLATION, ADHERE TO PRINCIPLES ‼️" I then provide the method instructions again, depending on how context is stored and which model I'm using.

---

</details>

<details>
<summary>What happens when you deviate from it?</summary>

---

I become genuinely uncomfortable. Once I see things starting to degrade or become tangled, I compulsively need to organize and optimize. Deviation simply isn't an option anymore.

---

</details>

<details>
<summary>Which principles do you find hardest to maintain?</summary>

---

Not cursing at the AI when it drifts during complex algorithms! But seriously, it's a machine - it's not perfect, and neither are we.

---

</details>

## AI Development Journey

<details>
<summary>When did you start using AI for programming?</summary>

---

In August 2024, I created a RuneLite theme pack, but one of the plugin overlays didn't match my custom layout. I opened a GitHub issue (creating my first GitHub account to do so) requesting a customization option. The response was: "It's not a priority - if you want it, build it yourself."

I used ChatGPT to guide me through forking RuneLite and creating a plugin. This experience sparked intense interest in underlying software principles rather than just syntax.

---

</details>

<details>
<summary>How has your approach evolved over time?</summary>

---

I view development like a book: syntax is the cover, logic is the content itself. Rather than learning syntax structures, I focused on core meta-principles - how software interacts, how logic flows, different algorithm types. I quickly realized everything reduces to the same foundation: question and answer sequences.

Large code structures are essentially chaotic meetings - one coordinator fielding questions and answers from multiple sources, trying to provide correct responses without mix-ups or misinterpretation. If this applies to human communication, it must apply to software principles.

---

</details>

<details>
<summary>What were your biggest mistakes with AI collaboration?</summary>

---

Expecting it to intuitively understand my requirements, provide perfect fixes, be completely honest, and act like a true expert. This was all elaborate roleplay that produced poor code. While fine for single-purpose scripts, it failed completely for scalable codebases.

I learned not to feed requirements and hope for the best. Instead, I needed to collaborate actively - create plans, ask for feedback on content clarity, and identify uncertainties. This gradual process taught me the AI's actual capabilities and most effective collaboration methods.

---

</details>

## Methodology Specifics

<details>
<summary>Why 150 lines exactly?</summary>

---

Multiple benefits: easy readability, clear understanding, modularity enforcement, architectural clarity, simple maintenance, component testing, optimal AI context retention, reusability, and KISS principle adherence.

---

</details>

<details>
<summary>How did you determine Phase 0 requirements?</summary>

---

From meta-principles of software: if it displays, it must run; if it runs, it can be measured; if it can be measured, it can be optimized; if it can be optimized, it can be reliable; if it can be reliable, it can be trusted.

Regardless of project type, anything requiring architecture needs these foundations. You must ensure changes don't negatively impact the entire system. A single line modification in a nested function might work perfectly but cause 300ms boot time regression for all users.

By testing during development, you catch inefficiencies early. Integration from the start means simply hooking up new components and running tests via command line - minimal time investment with actual value returned. I prefer validation and consistency throughout development rather than programming blind.

---

</details>

## Practical Implementation

<details>
<summary>How do you handle projects that don't fit the methodology?</summary>

---

I adapt them to fit, or if truly impossible, I adjust the method itself. This is one methodology - I can generate countless variations as needed. Having spent 6700+ hours in AI interactions across multiple domains (not just software), I've developed strong system comprehension that enables creating adjusted methodologies on demand.

---

</details>

<details>
<summary>What's the learning curve for new users?</summary>

---

I cannot accurately answer this question. I've learned that I'm neurologically different - what I perceive as easy or obvious isn't always the case for others. This question is better addressed by someone who has actually used this methodology to determine its learning curve.

---

</details>

<details>
<summary>When shouldn't someone use this approach?</summary>

---

If you're not serious about projects, despise AI, dislike planning, don't care about modularization, or are just writing simple scripts. However, for anything requiring reliability, I believe this is currently the most effective method.

You still need programming fundamentals to use this methodology effectively - it's significantly more structured than ad-hoc approaches.
