# Metaflow: Build and Manage AI and ML Systems with Ease

**Metaflow, originally developed at Netflix, is a human-centric framework designed to streamline the entire machine learning lifecycle, from prototyping to production.** This powerful tool enables data scientists and engineers to build, manage, and scale real-world AI and ML systems efficiently.  [Learn more on the official GitHub repository](https://github.com/Netflix/metaflow).

## Key Features of Metaflow:

*   **Simplified Workflow:** Transition seamlessly from rapid prototyping in notebooks to reliable production deployments.
*   **Scalable Infrastructure:** Easily scale your workloads horizontally and vertically in the cloud, supporting both CPUs and GPUs.
*   **Unified Management:** Manage code, data, and compute throughout the entire AI/ML lifecycle for end-to-end control.
*   **Experiment Tracking & Versioning:** Built-in support for experiment tracking, versioning, and visualization to optimize your ML workflow.
*   **Dependency Management:** Effortlessly manage dependencies and deploy with one-click to production-grade orchestrators.
*   **Rapid Prototyping:** Leverage a Pythonic API for quick local prototyping.
*   **Reactive Orchestration:** Benefit from built-in support for reactive orchestration.

## Why Choose Metaflow?
