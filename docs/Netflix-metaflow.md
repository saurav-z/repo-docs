# Metaflow: Build, Manage, and Scale AI & ML Systems

**Metaflow, originally developed at Netflix, is a human-centric framework designed to empower data scientists and engineers to build and manage real-world AI and ML systems, from prototyping to production.**

[Metaflow](https://metaflow.org), now supported by [Outerbounds](https://outerbounds.com), streamlines the entire AI/ML development lifecycle, enabling teams of all sizes to iterate quickly and deliver robust systems efficiently. It offers a unified approach to code, data, and compute, simplifying the development, deployment, and management of complex AI and ML workflows.

Metaflow is used by a diverse range of companies, including Amazon, Doordash, Dyson, Goldman Sachs, Ramp, and many more (see [ADOPTERS.md](ADOPTERS.md)).  At Netflix alone, Metaflow supports over 3000 AI and ML projects.

## Key Features of Metaflow:

*   **Rapid Prototyping & Experimentation:**
    *   Develop and test AI/ML models locally with ease, leveraging notebook support.
    *   Built-in support for experiment tracking, versioning, and visualization to accelerate research.
*   **Scalable & Reliable Production:**
    *   Effortlessly scale compute resources in the cloud (CPUs/GPUs).
    *   Manage data access efficiently for both parallel and distributed workloads.
    *   Ensures reliable execution and efficient resource utilization.
*   **Simplified Deployment & Management:**
    *   Easily manage dependencies and deploy with one-click.
    *   Built-in support for reactive orchestration for automated workflows.
    *   Provides a simplified and pythonic API

## From Prototype to Production:
