# Metaflow: Build, Manage, and Scale Your AI/ML Systems with Ease

[Metaflow](https://metaflow.org) is a powerful, human-centric framework designed to empower data scientists and engineers to build and manage real-world AI and ML systems efficiently and effectively. Originally developed at [Netflix](https://netflixtechblog.com/open-sourcing-metaflow-a-human-centric-framework-for-data-science-fa72e04a5d9) and now supported by [Outerbounds](https://outerbounds.com), Metaflow streamlines the entire machine learning lifecycle.

**Key Features & Benefits:**

*   **Rapid Prototyping & Experimentation:** Quickly prototype and iterate with support for local development, notebooks, experiment tracking, versioning, and visualization.
*   **Scalable Compute:** Effortlessly scale your workloads horizontally and vertically on your cloud infrastructure, leveraging both CPUs and GPUs.
*   **Simplified Production Deployment:** Deploy your workflows to production with one-click, managing dependencies, and reactive orchestration.
*   **Unified Framework:** Unify code, data, and compute at every stage, ensuring end-to-end management of your AI/ML systems.

Metaflow empowers teams of all sizes and scales to boost productivity, delivering robust and reliable AI/ML systems across various projects, from classical statistics to deep learning and foundation models. Metaflow is trusted by leading companies like Amazon, DoorDash, Dyson, and many others.

## Key Capabilities

*   **Rapid Prototyping and Experimentation:** Metaflow offers a pythonic API with features for [rapid prototyping](https://docs.metaflow.org/metaflow/basics), [notebook support](https://docs.metaflow.org/metaflow/managing-flows/notebook-runs), [experiment tracking, versioning](https://docs.metaflow.org/metaflow/client), and [visualization](https://docs.metaflow.org/metaflow/visualizing-results).
*   **Scalable Compute:** Scale both horizontally and vertically in your cloud using CPUs and GPUs with fast data access. Run parallel workloads with reliability and efficiency. See [scaling documentation](https://docs.metaflow.org/scaling/remote-tasks/introduction) for more details.
*   **Production Deployment:** Easily manage dependencies and deploy with one-click to highly available production orchestrators, with built-in support for [reactive orchestration](https://docs.metaflow.org/production/event-triggering).
