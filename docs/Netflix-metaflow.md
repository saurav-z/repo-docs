# Metaflow: Build, Manage, and Scale Your AI/ML Systems with Ease

Metaflow, originally developed at Netflix, is a human-centric framework designed to empower data scientists and engineers to build and manage robust, scalable AI and ML systems efficiently.

[**Explore the Metaflow GitHub Repository**](https://github.com/Netflix/metaflow)

Metaflow streamlines the entire development lifecycle, from rapid prototyping to production deployment, enabling teams of all sizes to iterate quickly and deliver high-quality systems. Supported by Outerbounds, Metaflow is designed to boost productivity for research and engineering teams working on a wide variety of projects, from classical statistics to state-of-the-art deep learning and foundation models.

## Key Features of Metaflow:

*   **Rapid Prototyping and Experimentation:** Quickly prototype locally with notebook support, experiment tracking, versioning, and visualization.
*   **Scalable Compute:** Easily scale workloads horizontally and vertically in the cloud, utilizing both CPUs and GPUs, with fast data access, supporting both parallel and gang-scheduled compute workloads reliably and efficiently.
*   **Simplified Production Deployment:** Effortlessly manage dependencies and deploy with one-click to highly available production orchestrators with built-in support for reactive orchestration.

Metaflow empowers teams to unify code, data, and compute at every stage, ensuring seamless end-to-end management of real-world AI and ML systems.  It powers thousands of AI and ML projects across various companies, including Amazon, Doordash, Dyson, Goldman Sachs, and many others.

## Getting Started with Metaflow

### Installation
Install Metaflow using `pip`:

```bash
pip install metaflow
```
Or, install Metaflow using conda-forge:
```bash
conda install -c conda-forge metaflow
```

### Deploying Infrastructure
While you can get started easily on your laptop, Metaflow's main benefits come with scaling out to external compute clusters and production-grade workflow orchestrators.  Follow this [guide](https://outerbounds.com/engineering/welcome/) to configure Metaflow and the infrastructure behind it appropriately.
