# Metaflow: Build, Manage, and Scale Your AI and ML Systems with Ease

Metaflow, originally developed at Netflix, is a human-centric framework designed to empower data scientists and engineers in building and managing real-world AI and ML systems, from rapid prototyping to reliable production deployments.  [Explore the original repository](https://github.com/Netflix/metaflow).

## Key Features of Metaflow

Metaflow offers a comprehensive suite of features to streamline the entire machine learning lifecycle:

*   **Rapid Prototyping:** Quickly prototype in notebooks with built-in support for experiment tracking, versioning, and visualization.
*   **Scalable Compute:** Effortlessly scale your workloads horizontally and vertically on your cloud infrastructure, utilizing both CPUs and GPUs.
*   **Simplified Dependency Management:** Easily manage dependencies and deploy with one-click to highly available production environments.
*   **End-to-End Management:** Unifies code, data, and compute at every stage, ensuring seamless management of AI/ML systems.
*   **Production-Ready Orchestration:**  Supports reactive orchestration and provides features for robust and efficient execution of complex workflows.

## From Prototype to Production and Back
