# Metaflow: Build and Manage Real-World AI/ML Systems at Scale

**Metaflow, originally developed at Netflix, is a human-centric framework designed to streamline the entire AI/ML development lifecycle, from rapid prototyping to production deployment, empowering teams to build and manage robust systems efficiently.**

[Metaflow](https://metaflow.org), now supported by [Outerbounds](https://outerbounds.com), is a powerful, open-source framework that simplifies the development and management of AI and ML systems. It enables data scientists and engineers to focus on innovation by providing a unified environment for the entire workflow, from initial experiments to large-scale production deployments.

Used by companies like Amazon, Doordash, and Netflix (powering over 3000 AI/ML projects), Metaflow handles the complexities of data pipelines, model training, and deployment. It supports a diverse range of projects, from classical statistics to cutting-edge deep learning.  Metaflow is designed to boost productivity for research and engineering teams, handling projects that range from classical statistics to state-of-the-art deep learning and foundation models.

## Key Features of Metaflow

Metaflow offers a comprehensive set of features to accelerate your AI/ML projects:

*   **Simplified Workflow:** A Pythonic API that unifies code, data, and compute for streamlined end-to-end management.
*   **Rapid Prototyping:** Quick local prototyping, notebook support, and built-in experiment tracking and visualization.
*   **Scalable Computing:** Effortless scaling with cloud support (CPUs/GPUs), fast data access, and efficient management of both embarrassingly parallel and gang-scheduled workloads.
*   **Reliable Production:** One-click deployment to highly available production orchestrators, with dependency management and reactive orchestration.
*   **Versioning:** Integrated version control for your code, data, and models.
*   **Reproducibility:**  Ensure that your models and results can always be reproduced.
*   **Data Management:** Integrated data storage and access for large datasets.

## From Prototype to Production
