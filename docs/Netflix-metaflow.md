# Metaflow: Build, Manage, and Scale AI and ML Systems with Ease

Metaflow is a human-centric framework designed to streamline the entire machine learning lifecycle from prototyping to production. Developed at Netflix and now supported by Outerbounds, Metaflow empowers data scientists and engineers to build and manage real-world AI and ML systems efficiently.  **[View the original repository](https://github.com/Netflix/metaflow).**

## Key Features and Benefits

Metaflow offers a comprehensive set of features to accelerate your AI and ML development:

*   **Rapid Prototyping and Experimentation:**
    *   Quickly prototype in notebooks with built-in support.
    *   Track experiments, version code, and visualize results for faster iteration.
*   **Scalable Compute and Data Handling:**
    *   Seamlessly scale your workloads horizontally and vertically in the cloud.
    *   Utilize CPUs and GPUs with fast data access.
    *   Run massive parallel and distributed compute workloads reliably and efficiently.
*   **Production-Ready Deployment:**
    *   Easily manage dependencies.
    *   Deploy with one-click to highly available production orchestrators.
    *   Includes built-in support for reactive orchestration.

Metaflow powers thousands of AI and ML projects across diverse industries, from classical statistics to deep learning and foundation models.

### Deploying infrastructure for Metaflow in your cloud

While you can get started with Metaflow easily on your laptop, the main benefits of Metaflow lie in its ability to [scale out to external compute clusters](https://docs.metaflow.org/scaling/remote-tasks/introduction) and to [deploy to production-grade workflow orchestrators](https://docs.metaflow.org/production/introduction). To benefit from these features, follow this [guide](https://outerbounds.com/engineering/welcome/) to configure Metaflow and the infrastructure behind it appropriately.
