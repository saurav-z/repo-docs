# Metaflow: Build, Manage, and Scale AI/ML Systems with Ease

**Metaflow**, a human-centric framework, empowers data scientists and engineers to build, manage, and scale real-world AI and ML systems efficiently. This comprehensive framework streamlines the entire machine learning lifecycle, from rapid prototyping to reliable production deployment. Developed at Netflix and supported by Outerbounds, Metaflow provides a robust and intuitive platform for teams of all sizes, streamlining the entire development lifecycle—from rapid prototyping in notebooks to reliable, maintainable production deployments—enabling teams to iterate quickly and deliver robust systems efficiently. **[See the original repository](https://github.com/Netflix/metaflow) for more information.**

## Key Features of Metaflow

Metaflow provides a unified platform to address the challenges of building and managing AI/ML systems. Here's what you can expect:
