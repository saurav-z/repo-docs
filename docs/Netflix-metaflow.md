# Metaflow: Build, Manage, and Scale AI & ML Systems with Ease

**Metaflow**, originally developed at Netflix, is a human-centric framework designed to empower data scientists and engineers to build, manage, and deploy robust AI and Machine Learning (ML) systems at scale. [Learn more on GitHub](https://github.com/Netflix/metaflow).

Metaflow streamlines the entire AI/ML development lifecycle, from rapid prototyping to production deployment. This empowers teams of all sizes to iterate quickly and deliver high-quality systems efficiently, making it ideal for projects ranging from classical statistics to cutting-edge deep learning.

## Key Features

*   **Rapid Prototyping & Experimentation:**
    *   Develop and test AI/ML models locally with a Pythonic API.
    *   Seamlessly integrate with notebooks for iterative development.
    *   Built-in support for experiment tracking, versioning, and visualization for comprehensive model management.
*   **Scalable Infrastructure & Computation:**
    *   Effortlessly scale workloads horizontally and vertically in your cloud environment (AWS, GCP, Azure etc.).
    *   Supports both CPU and GPU resources for compute-intensive tasks.
    *   Fast data access for efficient processing of massive datasets.
*   **Production-Ready Deployment & Management:**
    *   Simplify dependency management for reproducible results.
    *   Deploy with one-click to highly available production orchestrators.
    *   Reactive orchestration with event-triggered workflows.

## From Prototype to Production and Back

Metaflow provides a simple and friendly Pythonic [API](https://docs.metaflow.org) that covers foundational needs of AI and ML systems:

## Getting Started

Metaflow is easy to set up and use!  Explore the power of Metaflow with the [Metaflow sandbox](https://outerbounds.com/sandbox).

### Installation

Install Metaflow using pip:

```bash
pip install metaflow
```

Or, use conda-forge:

```bash
conda install -c conda-forge metaflow
```

Then, follow the [tutorial](https://docs.metaflow.org/getting-started/tutorials) to create and run your first Metaflow flow.
