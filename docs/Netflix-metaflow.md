# Metaflow: Build, Manage, and Scale AI/ML Systems with Ease

Metaflow, originally developed at Netflix, is a human-centric framework designed to simplify the entire machine learning lifecycle, empowering data scientists and engineers to build and manage production-ready AI/ML systems efficiently. ([View on GitHub](https://github.com/Netflix/metaflow))

## Key Features and Benefits

Metaflow streamlines the AI/ML development process, offering:

*   **Rapid Prototyping & Experimentation:** Quickly prototype and iterate with Python-based APIs, notebook support, and built-in experiment tracking, versioning, and visualization tools.
*   **Scalable Compute & Data:** Easily scale both horizontally and vertically in your cloud environment using CPUs and GPUs for massive parallel processing, ensuring fast data access.
*   **Production-Ready Deployment:** Effortlessly manage dependencies and deploy with one-click to highly available production orchestrators, including reactive orchestration.

## From Prototype to Production

Metaflow provides a seamless workflow, allowing you to move from initial prototyping to production deployment with ease:
