# Metaflow: Build, Manage, and Scale Your AI/ML Systems

Metaflow, originally developed at Netflix and now supported by Outerbounds, is a human-centric framework designed to empower data scientists and engineers to build, manage, and scale real-world AI and ML systems. ([See the original repo](https://github.com/Netflix/metaflow))

Metaflow streamlines the entire AI/ML development lifecycle, from rapid prototyping in notebooks to reliable production deployments, enabling teams to iterate quickly and deliver robust systems efficiently. It supports teams of all sizes and scale, and is used by a diverse array of companies, including Amazon, Doordash, Dyson, Goldman Sachs, and many others.

## Key Features

*   **Rapid Prototyping & Experimentation:**
    *   Quickly prototype AI/ML models in notebooks with a user-friendly Pythonic API.
    *   Built-in support for experiment tracking, versioning, and visualization.
*   **Scalable Computing:**
    *   Effortlessly scale workloads both horizontally and vertically in your cloud environment.
    *   Supports CPUs and GPUs with fast data access for both embarrassingly parallel and gang-scheduled workloads.
    *   Ensures reliable and efficient execution, including advanced failure handling and checkpointing capabilities.
*   **Production-Ready Deployments:**
    *   Simple dependency management.
    *   One-click deployment to production-grade workflow orchestrators.
    *   Includes support for reactive orchestration.
