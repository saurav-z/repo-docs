# Metaflow: Build and Manage AI/ML Systems with Ease

**Metaflow is a human-centric framework, originally created at Netflix, that empowers data scientists and engineers to build, manage, and scale real-world AI and ML systems efficiently.**  This framework simplifies the entire machine learning lifecycle, from rapid prototyping to reliable production deployments.

Developed at Netflix and now supported by Outerbounds, Metaflow boosts productivity for teams working on diverse projects, from statistical analysis to advanced deep learning.  It streamlines the AI/ML workflow by unifying code, data, and compute.

Metaflow powers thousands of AI and ML projects across various companies, including Amazon, DoorDash, Dyson, Goldman Sachs, and more. At Netflix alone, it supports over 3,000 projects, executes hundreds of millions of data-intensive compute jobs, and manages petabytes of data and models for hundreds of users.

## Key Features of Metaflow:

*   **Rapid Prototyping & Experimentation:**
    *   Pythonic API for quick development and testing.
    *   Seamless notebook integration.
    *   Built-in experiment tracking, versioning, and visualization.
*   **Scalable Compute & Data Access:**
    *   Effortlessly scale across cloud infrastructure using CPUs and GPUs.
    *   Fast data access for efficient processing of large datasets.
    *   Supports both embarrassingly parallel and gang-scheduled workloads.
*   **Simplified Deployment & Management:**
    *   Easy dependency management.
    *   One-click deployment to production-grade workflow orchestrators.
    *   Reactive orchestration support.
