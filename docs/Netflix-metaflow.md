# Metaflow: Build and Manage AI/ML Systems at Scale

**Metaflow**, originally developed at Netflix, is a human-centric framework designed to empower data scientists and engineers to build and manage real-world AI and ML systems effectively.  For the latest updates and information, visit the [original repository](https://github.com/Netflix/metaflow).

## Key Features of Metaflow

Metaflow provides a comprehensive platform for the entire AI/ML lifecycle, from prototyping to production. Key benefits include:

*   **Rapid Prototyping & Experimentation:**  Accelerate development with a Pythonic API, notebook support, and built-in features for experiment tracking, versioning, and visualization.
*   **Scalable Compute & Data Management:** Seamlessly scale workloads horizontally and vertically on your cloud infrastructure, leveraging CPUs and GPUs, with efficient data access for massive parallel processing.
*   **Simplified Production Deployment:** Easily manage dependencies and deploy with one-click to production-grade orchestrators with reactive orchestration support.
*   **End-to-End Workflow Management:** Unify code, data, and compute for seamless management of the entire AI/ML pipeline.
*   **Built for Teams:** Designed to boost the productivity of research and engineering teams of all sizes.

## From Prototype to Production (and Back)

Metaflow offers a streamlined workflow, as illustrated below:
