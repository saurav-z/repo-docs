# Metaflow: The Human-Centric Framework for Building and Managing AI/ML Systems

**Metaflow**, originally developed at Netflix, is a powerful, human-centric framework designed to streamline the entire AI and ML development lifecycle, from rapid prototyping to reliable production deployments.  This framework helps data scientists and engineers build and manage real-life AI and ML systems.  [Learn more about Metaflow](https://github.com/Netflix/metaflow).

## Key Features & Benefits

Metaflow simplifies the development and deployment of AI/ML systems. Here's how:

*   **Rapid Prototyping & Experimentation:**  Quickly prototype, experiment, and iterate using notebooks, with built-in support for versioning, experiment tracking, and visualization.
*   **Seamless Scaling:** Effortlessly scale compute resources horizontally and vertically, leveraging CPUs and GPUs in your cloud environment.  Supports fast data access for both parallel and distributed workloads.
*   **Simplified Production Deployment:** Easily manage dependencies and deploy AI/ML workflows with one-click to production orchestrators, with reactive orchestration support.
*   **End-to-End Management:** Unifies code, data, and compute throughout the entire AI/ML pipeline, ensuring efficient management of complex systems.
*   **Large-Scale Adoption:** Trusted by numerous companies, including Amazon, DoorDash, Dyson, and Goldman Sachs, powering thousands of AI/ML projects.

## From Prototype to Production and Beyond

Metaflow provides a user-friendly Pythonic API covering the foundational needs of AI and ML systems.
