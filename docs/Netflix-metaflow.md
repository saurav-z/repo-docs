# Metaflow: Build, Manage, and Scale AI and ML Systems with Ease

[Metaflow](https://metaflow.org), a human-centric framework originally developed at Netflix, empowers data scientists and engineers to build and manage robust AI and ML systems from prototyping to production.  This framework is supported by [Outerbounds](https://outerbounds.com) and used by companies like Amazon, Doordash, and Dyson.

## Key Features of Metaflow:

Metaflow simplifies the entire AI/ML development lifecycle with these key features:

*   **Rapid Prototyping:** Quickly experiment with code using a Pythonic API with support for notebooks, experiment tracking, versioning, and visualization.
*   **Seamless Scaling:** Easily scale workloads both horizontally and vertically in your cloud environment, utilizing CPUs and GPUs for efficient processing of massive datasets.
*   **Simplified Production Deployment:** Effortlessly deploy your models with one-click to production orchestrators.
*   **Dependency Management:** Easily manage dependencies for your projects.

## From Prototype to Production and Back

Metaflow provides a streamlined, Pythonic API that covers the critical needs of AI/ML systems, as shown in this diagram:
