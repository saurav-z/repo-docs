# Metaflow: Build, Manage, and Scale AI and ML Systems with Ease

Metaflow is a human-centric framework designed to simplify the entire AI and ML development lifecycle, from prototyping to production.  Originally developed at Netflix and now supported by Outerbounds, Metaflow empowers data scientists and engineers to build robust, scalable, and maintainable AI/ML systems.

**Key Features:**

*   **Rapid Prototyping & Experimentation:**  Quickly prototype and iterate with a user-friendly Python API, notebook support, built-in experiment tracking, versioning, and visualization tools.
*   **Scalable Compute:** Effortlessly scale workloads horizontally and vertically using CPUs and GPUs in the cloud with fast data access and support for both parallel and distributed computing.
*   **Production-Ready Deployment:** Easily manage dependencies and deploy with one-click to highly available production orchestrators with reactive orchestration.
*   **End-to-End Management:** Unifies code, data, and compute throughout the entire AI/ML lifecycle.
*   **Rich Ecosystem:**  Powers thousands of AI/ML projects across a variety of companies, from startups to large enterprises.
