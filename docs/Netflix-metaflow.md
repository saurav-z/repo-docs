# Metaflow: Build, Manage, and Scale AI & ML Systems with Ease

**Metaflow, originally developed at Netflix, is a human-centric framework designed to empower data scientists and engineers to build and manage robust AI and ML systems from prototyping to production.**

[Metaflow](https://github.com/Netflix/metaflow) is a powerful framework designed to streamline the entire AI/ML development lifecycle. From rapid prototyping in notebooks to reliable, maintainable production deployments, Metaflow helps teams of all sizes iterate quickly and deliver impactful results efficiently. Supported by [Outerbounds](https://outerbounds.com), Metaflow enhances the productivity of research and engineering teams working on a wide array of projects, from classical statistics to state-of-the-art deep learning and foundation models.

Metaflow unifies code, data, and compute at every stage, ensuring seamless end-to-end management of real-world AI and ML systems. It powers thousands of AI and ML experiences across diverse companies, including Amazon, Doordash, Dyson, Goldman Sachs, and many others. At Netflix alone, Metaflow supports thousands of projects and handles massive data-intensive jobs.

## Key Features of Metaflow:
