# Metaflow: Build, Manage, and Scale AI/ML Systems with Ease

**Metaflow, a human-centric framework, simplifies the entire machine learning lifecycle, empowering data scientists and engineers to build and manage AI/ML systems from prototyping to production.** ([See the original repository](https://github.com/Netflix/metaflow))

## Key Features of Metaflow

Metaflow provides a comprehensive suite of features to streamline the AI/ML workflow:

*   **Rapid Prototyping & Experimentation:**
    *   Develop and test models quickly within notebooks.
    *   Seamlessly track experiments, version models, and visualize results.
*   **Scalable Computing:**
    *   Effortlessly scale workloads on cloud platforms (CPU/GPU).
    *   Supports massive parallel processing with fast data access.
    *   Reliable and efficient execution of compute tasks.
*   **Production-Ready Deployment:**
    *   Manage dependencies easily.
    *   Deploy with a single click to production-grade orchestrators.
    *   Built-in support for reactive orchestration (event-triggering).

## Metaflow in Action

Metaflow, originally developed at Netflix and now supported by Outerbounds, powers thousands of AI/ML projects across various industries and organizations, including Amazon, Doordash, Dyson, Goldman Sachs, and Ramp. It's designed to handle projects ranging from classical statistics to cutting-edge deep learning and foundation models.

## From Prototype to Production & Beyond

Metaflow provides a Pythonic API for a seamless workflow:

1.  **Rapid Prototyping and Experimentation**: Get started quickly with notebook support, experiment tracking, versioning, and visualization.
2.  **Cloud-Scale Computing**: Scale effortlessly on cloud platforms with fast data access for running both massive and gang-scheduled compute workloads.
3.  **Production Deployment**: Deploy with one-click to highly available production orchestrators, with built-in support for reactive orchestration.

## Getting Started with Metaflow

### Installation

Install Metaflow using `pip`:

```bash
pip install metaflow
```

Or with `conda`:

```bash
conda install -c conda-forge metaflow
```

Explore the [Metaflow Sandbox](https://outerbounds.com/sandbox) to run and explore in seconds.

Follow the [tutorial](https://docs.metaflow.org/getting-started/tutorials) to create and run your first Metaflow flow.

### Deploying Infrastructure for Metaflow in Your Cloud

While you can easily get started on your laptop, Metaflow shines when scaling to external compute clusters and deploying to production-grade workflow orchestrators. Configure Metaflow and its infrastructure using this [guide](https://outerbounds.com/engineering/welcome/).
