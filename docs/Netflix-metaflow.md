# Metaflow: Build and Manage Real-World AI and ML Systems with Ease

Metaflow, originally developed at Netflix and now supported by Outerbounds, is a human-centric framework empowering data scientists and engineers to build and manage robust AI and ML systems, from rapid prototyping to production deployments. Check out the original repo here: [Netflix/metaflow](https://github.com/Netflix/metaflow).

Metaflow simplifies the entire AI/ML lifecycle, streamlining workflows for teams of all sizes, enabling faster iteration and efficient delivery of high-performance systems. Metaflow powers thousands of AI and ML projects across various industries, processing massive datasets and managing petabytes of models and artifacts.

## Key Features of Metaflow

*   **Rapid Prototyping:** Quickly develop and test ideas with support for notebooks, experiment tracking, versioning, and visualization tools.
*   **Scalable Computing:** Seamlessly scale workloads horizontally and vertically using CPUs and GPUs on various cloud platforms, including fast data access and reliable job execution.
*   **Simplified Production Deployment:** Effortlessly manage dependencies and deploy with one-click to highly available production orchestrators with reactive orchestration.

## From Prototype to Production

Metaflow provides a simple and Pythonic API that bridges the gap between prototyping and production environments:
