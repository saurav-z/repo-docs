# Metaflow: Build and Manage AI/ML Systems with Ease

[![Metaflow Logo](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/763451/89453116-96a57e00-d713-11ea-9fa6-82b29d4d6eff.png)](https://github.com/Netflix/metaflow)

Metaflow, originally developed at Netflix and now supported by Outerbounds, is a human-centric framework designed to empower data scientists and engineers to build, manage, and scale real-life AI and ML systems effectively. From rapid prototyping to production deployment, Metaflow streamlines the entire AI/ML lifecycle for teams of all sizes.

**Key Features:**

*   **Rapid Prototyping:** Quickly experiment with notebooks, track experiments, version code, and visualize results locally.
*   **Scalable Compute:** Seamlessly scale workloads in the cloud using both CPUs and GPUs. Supports both embarrassingly parallel and gang-scheduled compute.
*   **Simplified Production Deployment:** Manage dependencies and deploy with one-click to production-ready orchestrators with reactive orchestration.

Metaflow is used by thousands of AI/ML projects across diverse companies, including Amazon, DoorDash, Dyson, Goldman Sachs, Ramp, and many others, as well as supporting over 3000 projects at Netflix alone.
