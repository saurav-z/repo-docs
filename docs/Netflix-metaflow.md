# Metaflow: Build and Manage Production-Ready AI & ML Systems

**Metaflow**, originally developed at Netflix, is a human-centric framework designed to empower data scientists and engineers to build, manage, and scale robust AI and ML systems from prototype to production.  This framework streamlines the entire development lifecycle, allowing teams of all sizes to iterate quickly and deliver high-quality systems efficiently.  [Learn more about Metaflow on GitHub](https://github.com/Netflix/metaflow).

Metaflow is supported by [Outerbounds](https://outerbounds.com) and is used by a wide range of companies, including Amazon, Doordash, Dyson, Goldman Sachs, and Ramp. At Netflix alone, Metaflow supports over 3,000 AI and ML projects.

## Key Features of Metaflow

*   **Rapid Prototyping:** Quickly experiment and iterate with local prototyping, notebook support, and built-in experiment tracking.
*   **Scalable Computation:** Seamlessly scale compute workloads horizontally and vertically in the cloud, utilizing both CPUs and GPUs.
*   **Efficient Data Access:** Benefit from fast data access for running massive parallel workloads.
*   **Simplified Dependency Management:** Easily manage dependencies and deploy with one-click to production.
*   **Production-Ready Orchestration:** Benefit from reactive orchestration with built-in support.
*   **Experiment Tracking & Versioning:** Built-in support for experiment tracking, versioning, and visualization.

## From Prototype to Production: A Seamless Workflow

Metaflow provides a Pythonic API that covers the core needs of AI and ML systems:
