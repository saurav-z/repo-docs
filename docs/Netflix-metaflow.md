# Metaflow: Build and Manage AI and ML Systems at Scale

[![Metaflow Logo](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/763451/89453116-96a57e00-d713-11ea-9fa6-82b29d4d6eff.png)](https://github.com/Netflix/metaflow)

Metaflow, originally developed at Netflix, is a human-centric framework designed to empower data scientists and engineers to build, manage, and scale real-world AI and ML systems.

Metaflow streamlines the entire development lifecycle, from rapid prototyping in notebooks to reliable and maintainable production deployments, making it easier for teams to iterate quickly and deliver robust systems efficiently. Supporting teams of all sizes and scale, Metaflow provides a unified experience for code, data, and compute.  This helps to ensure seamless, end-to-end management of your AI and ML projects.

Trusted by a diverse range of companies, including Amazon, DoorDash, Dyson, and Goldman Sachs, Metaflow currently supports thousands of AI and ML projects.  It powers high-performance compute jobs processing petabytes of data for hundreds of users across AI, ML, data science, and engineering teams.

## Key Features of Metaflow

*   **Rapid Prototyping:** Develop quickly with local prototyping, notebook support, experiment tracking, versioning, and visualization.
*   **Scalable Compute:** Easily scale horizontally and vertically in your cloud environment, leveraging CPUs and GPUs for both parallel and distributed workloads.
*   **Reliable Production Deployment:** Effortlessly manage dependencies and deploy with one-click to production orchestrators, with built-in support for reactive orchestration.

## From Prototype to Production

Metaflow offers a Pythonic API to simplify the AI and ML system lifecycle:

## Getting Started

### Installation

Install Metaflow using `pip`:

```bash
pip install metaflow
```

Or, using `conda`:

```bash
conda install -c conda-forge metaflow
```

Get started with the [tutorial](https://docs.metaflow.org/getting-started/tutorials) to create and run your first Metaflow flow. Explore further resources like:

*   [Additional resources](https://docs.metaflow.org/introduction/metaflow-resources)

### Deploying Infrastructure

To benefit from Metaflow's scalability and production deployment features, configure it with external compute clusters and workflow orchestrators. See this [guide](https://outerbounds.com/engineering/welcome/) to set up the appropriate infrastructure.
