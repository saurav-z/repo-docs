# Metaflow: Build and Manage AI/ML Systems with Ease

**Metaflow, originally created at Netflix, is a human-centric framework designed to empower data scientists and engineers to build and manage robust, real-world AI and ML systems.** This open-source project streamlines the entire machine learning lifecycle, from initial prototyping to scalable production deployments.

Metaflow is designed to boost the productivity for research and engineering teams working on [a wide variety of projects](https://netflixtechblog.com/supporting-diverse-ml-systems-at-netflix-2d2e6b6d205d), from classical statistics to state-of-the-art deep learning and foundation models. Metaflow helps you build, manage, and scale your AI and ML systems efficiently. It is used by numerous companies of all sizes, including Amazon, Doordash, Dyson, Goldman Sachs, Ramp, and [many others](ADOPTERS.md).

## Key Features

Metaflow simplifies and accelerates your AI/ML workflow with these core capabilities:

*   **Rapid Prototyping & Experimentation:**
    *   Quickly prototype locally using Python notebooks.
    *   Built-in support for experiment tracking, versioning, and visualization to understand your models better.
*   **Scalable Execution:**
    *   Seamlessly scale your workloads horizontally and vertically in the cloud (CPUs, GPUs).
    *   Fast data access for efficient execution of massive, parallel compute jobs.
*   **Production-Ready Deployment:**
    *   Easy dependency management.
    *   One-click deployment to production orchestrators.
    *   Support for reactive orchestration to automate workflows.

## From Prototype to Production (and Back)

Metaflow provides a user-friendly Python API to streamline the end-to-end management of your AI/ML projects:
