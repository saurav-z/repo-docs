# Metaflow: Build, Manage, and Scale Your AI/ML Systems

**Metaflow, a human-centric framework from Netflix and Outerbounds, empowers data scientists and engineers to build and manage real-world AI and ML systems with unparalleled efficiency and scalability.**

[Metaflow](https://metaflow.org) is designed to streamline the entire AI/ML lifecycle, from rapid prototyping in notebooks to reliable and maintainable production deployments. It's used by teams of all sizes, and is ideal for projects ranging from classical statistics to cutting-edge deep learning.

Originally developed at [Netflix](https://netflixtechblog.com/open-sourcing-metaflow-a-human-centric-framework-for-data-science-fa72e04a5d9) and now supported by [Outerbounds](https://outerbounds.com), Metaflow has become a trusted solution for thousands of AI/ML projects across various industries. Notably, it powers over 3000 AI/ML projects at Netflix alone, managing petabytes of data and models for hundreds of users.  

**Key Features & Benefits:**

*   **Rapid Prototyping:**  Quickly iterate with notebooks, experiment tracking, versioning, and visualization tools.
*   **Scalable Compute:** Effortlessly scale workloads in the cloud, utilizing both CPUs and GPUs. Includes fast data access for efficient execution.
*   **Simplified Dependency Management:**  Easily manage dependencies and deploy with one-click to production-grade orchestration.
*   **Unified Framework:** Combines code, data, and compute at every stage of the workflow.
*   **Production Ready:** Supports reactive orchestration for reliable deployments.
