# Metaflow: Build and Manage AI/ML Systems with Ease

[Metaflow](https://metaflow.org) is a human-centric framework, originally developed at Netflix, designed to empower data scientists and engineers to build, manage, and scale robust AI and ML systems, from rapid prototyping to production deployment. [View the source code on GitHub](https://github.com/Netflix/metaflow).

## Key Features and Benefits

Metaflow provides a unified platform to streamline the entire AI/ML lifecycle, offering:

*   **Rapid Prototyping and Experimentation:**  Quickly prototype and iterate with local development, notebook support, built-in experiment tracking, versioning, and visualization tools.
*   **Seamless Scalability:** Effortlessly scale your workloads horizontally and vertically using CPUs and GPUs in the cloud, with optimized data access for massive parallel processing.
*   **Reliable Production Deployment:** Simplify dependency management and deploy with one-click to highly available production orchestrators, including reactive orchestration support.
*   **Unified Workflow Management:** Metaflow unifies code, data, and compute, ensuring end-to-end management of real-world AI and ML systems.

## Who Uses Metaflow?

Metaflow is trusted by a diverse range of companies, from startups to Fortune 500 enterprises, including: Amazon, Doordash, Dyson, Goldman Sachs, and Ramp, among many others. At Netflix alone, Metaflow supports thousands of AI/ML projects and executes millions of data-intensive jobs.

## From Prototype to Production: The Metaflow Advantage
