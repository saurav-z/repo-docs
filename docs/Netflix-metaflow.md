# Metaflow: Build, Manage, and Scale Your AI/ML Systems

**Metaflow, developed by Netflix and now supported by Outerbounds, is a human-centric framework designed to empower data scientists and engineers to build and manage AI/ML systems effectively.** [Explore the original repository](https://github.com/Netflix/metaflow) for more details.

Metaflow streamlines the entire development lifecycle, enabling rapid prototyping, reliable production deployments, and efficient iteration for teams of all sizes. From classical statistics to cutting-edge deep learning and foundation models, Metaflow helps unify code, data, and compute, providing end-to-end management of real-world AI and ML systems.

## Key Features & Benefits

Metaflow offers a comprehensive set of features to accelerate and simplify your AI/ML projects:

*   **Rapid Prototyping & Experimentation:** Develop and test models locally with robust support for notebooks, experiment tracking, versioning, and visualization.
*   **Scalable Compute:** Effortlessly scale workloads horizontally and vertically in your cloud, leveraging both CPUs and GPUs for efficient and reliable processing of massive datasets.
*   **Production-Ready Deployment:** Deploy with one-click to highly available production orchestrators, streamlining the transition from prototype to production with reactive orchestration.
*   **Simplified Dependency Management:** Easily manage dependencies and ensure consistent environments across all stages of your ML workflow.
*   **Optimized Data Access:** Fast data access for both embarrassingly parallel and gang-scheduled compute workloads.

## Who Uses Metaflow?

Metaflow is trusted by a wide range of companies, including:

*   Amazon
*   Doordash
*   Dyson
*   Goldman Sachs
*   Ramp
*   ... and many more (see [ADOPTERS.md](ADOPTERS.md)).

Metaflow powers thousands of AI and ML experiences, handling petabytes of data and managing tens of petabytes of models and artifacts.
