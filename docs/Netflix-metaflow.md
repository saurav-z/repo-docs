# Metaflow: Build and Manage AI/ML Systems at Scale

**Metaflow is a human-centric framework designed to empower data scientists and engineers to build, manage, and deploy robust AI/ML systems efficiently and at scale.** Originally developed at Netflix, Metaflow streamlines the entire machine learning lifecycle from prototyping to production, supporting teams of all sizes and project types.

[See the original repository on GitHub](https://github.com/Netflix/metaflow)

## Key Features of Metaflow

Metaflow provides a comprehensive set of features to streamline your AI/ML workflows:
