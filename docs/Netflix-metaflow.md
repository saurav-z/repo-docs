# Metaflow: Build and Manage AI & ML Systems with Ease

**Metaflow, a human-centric framework originally developed at Netflix, empowers data scientists and engineers to build, deploy, and manage real-world AI and ML systems with efficiency and scale.**

[Metaflow](https://metaflow.org) streamlines the entire AI/ML development lifecycle, enabling teams of all sizes to iterate rapidly and deliver robust systems.  From rapid prototyping in notebooks to reliable, maintainable production deployments, Metaflow unifies code, data, and compute.  It is now supported by [Outerbounds](https://outerbounds.com).

## Key Features of Metaflow:

*   **Rapid Prototyping and Experimentation:**
    *   Develop and test locally with notebook support.
    *   Track experiments, version code and data.
    *   Visualize results easily.
*   **Scalable Compute and Data Management:**
    *   Scale seamlessly with cloud-native support (CPU & GPU).
    *   Utilize fast data access for efficient processing.
    *   Run embarrassingly parallel and gang-scheduled workloads.
*   **Simplified Production Deployment:**
    *   Manage dependencies effortlessly.
    *   Deploy with one-click to production orchestrators.
    *   Implement reactive orchestration for automated workflows.

## Use Cases & Benefits

Metaflow is used by diverse companies, including Amazon, DoorDash, and Goldman Sachs, powering thousands of AI and ML projects, processing petabytes of data, and managing models for hundreds of users.  Metaflow helps teams to:

*   Accelerate AI/ML development.
*   Improve model maintainability and reliability.
*   Enhance team collaboration and productivity.
*   Scale AI/ML systems from prototype to production.
