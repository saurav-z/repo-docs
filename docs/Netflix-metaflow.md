# Metaflow: Build and Manage AI and ML Systems at Scale

**Metaflow, developed at Netflix, is a human-centric framework designed to streamline the entire AI/ML lifecycle from rapid prototyping to reliable production deployments.** This powerful framework empowers data scientists and engineers to build, manage, and scale complex AI/ML systems efficiently.  

[See the original repository here](https://github.com/Netflix/metaflow).

Metaflow, now supported by [Outerbounds](https://outerbounds.com), is designed to enhance the productivity of research and engineering teams working on diverse projects, ranging from classical statistics to state-of-the-art deep learning and foundation models. Metaflow supports a wide range of companies from small to large, including Amazon, Doordash, Dyson, Goldman Sachs, and Ramp. Metaflow has been battle-tested across thousands of AI and ML projects. At Netflix alone, Metaflow supports over 3000 AI/ML projects, executes hundreds of millions of data-intensive, high-performance compute jobs processing petabytes of data, and manages tens of petabytes of models and artifacts.

## Key Features of Metaflow

*   **Rapid Prototyping & Experimentation:** Provides a user-friendly Pythonic API, including support for notebooks, experiment tracking, versioning, and visualization.
*   **Scalable Compute:** Effortlessly scales your workloads, both horizontally and vertically, in your cloud using CPUs and GPUs with fast data access.
*   **Simplified Deployment:** Easily manage dependencies and deploy with one-click to highly available production orchestrators with built-in support for reactive orchestration.
*   **Seamless End-to-End Management:** Unifies code, data, and compute at every stage, ensuring seamless management of real-world AI and ML systems.

## From Prototype to Production and Back
