# ASV: Benchmarking Python Packages Over Time

**Track and visualize the performance of your Python packages with ASV, the powerful benchmarking tool designed for long-term performance analysis.**

ASV (airspeed velocity) is a specialized tool for benchmarking Python packages, ideal for monitoring performance changes throughout a project's lifecycle. It allows you to easily track how your code's speed evolves over time, providing valuable insights for optimization and ensuring consistent performance.

**Key Features:**

*   **Historical Benchmarking:**  Monitor performance trends over time, allowing you to identify performance regressions and improvements.
*   **Interactive Web Frontend:**  Visualize benchmark results with an intuitive, interactive web interface that can be hosted using a simple static webserver.  See an [example airspeed velocity site](https://pv.github.io/numpy-bench/).
*   **Comprehensive Analysis:** Analyze benchmark data to understand the impact of code changes on performance.
*   **Easy Installation:** Install ASV directly from PyPI using `pip install asv`.
*   **Project Integration:** Easily integrate ASV into your project and add a badge to your README to show it is being benchmarked.
*   **BSD License:** Open-source under the BSD three-clause license.
