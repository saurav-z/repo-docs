# ASV: Benchmarking Python Packages Over Time

**Tired of performance regressions in your Python projects?** ASV (airspeed velocity) is the perfect tool for tracking your project's performance over its entire lifetime, helping you identify bottlenecks and ensure optimal speed. [Visit the original repository on GitHub](https://github.com/airspeed-velocity/asv) for the full details.

## Key Features of ASV:

*   **Comprehensive Benchmarking:** ASV allows you to benchmark Python packages and projects with ease.
*   **Historical Performance Tracking:** Monitor performance changes over time, identifying performance improvements or regressions.
*   **Interactive Web Frontend:** Visualize your benchmark results in a user-friendly, interactive web interface.  Requires only a simple static webserver to host.
*   **Project Lifecycle Focus:** Primarily designed to benchmark a single project across its development lifecycle.
*   **Easy Installation:** Install ASV quickly using `pip install asv`.
*   **Badge Integration:** Easily add an "Asv Benchmarked" badge to your project's README.

## Show Your Support

If you're using ASV, consider adding a badge to your project's README to let others know:

```markdown
[![asv](https://img.shields.io/badge/benchmarked%20by-asv-blue.svg?style=flat)](https://your-url-here/)
```

Replace `https://your-url-here/` with a link to your ASV benchmark results.
