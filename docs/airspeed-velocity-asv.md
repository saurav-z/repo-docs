## Key Features of ASV

*   **Comprehensive Benchmarking:** Measure the performance of your Python code using a suite of benchmarks.
*   **Historical Tracking:** Monitor performance changes over time, allowing you to identify performance regressions and improvements.
*   **Interactive Web Frontend:** Visualize benchmark results in a user-friendly, interactive web interface hosted by a static web server.
*   **Easy Installation:** Install ASV quickly using `pip install asv`.
*   **Project Badge:** Easily display a badge in your project's README to indicate that it is benchmarked with ASV.

## How ASV Works

ASV allows you to benchmark a single project over its lifetime using a suite of defined benchmarks. The results are then displayed in an interactive web frontend, making it easy to analyze the impact of code changes on performance.
