*   **Easy Setup:** Install ASV with a simple `pip install asv` command.
*   **Example & Documentation:** Explore the functionality with an `example airspeed velocity site <https://pv.github.io/numpy-bench/>`__ and consult the comprehensive `full documentation <https://asv.readthedocs.io/>`__.
*   **Integrate with your project**: Add a badge to your project's README with the following markdown:
