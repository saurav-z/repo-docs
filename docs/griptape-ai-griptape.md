Comprehensive documentation is available at [https://docs.griptape.ai/](https://docs.griptape.ai/) to guide you through installation and usage.  For more, check out [Griptape Trade School](https://learn.griptape.ai/) for free online courses.

## Examples

### Hello World

A minimal Griptape example:

```python
from griptape.drivers.prompt.openai import OpenAiChatPromptDriver
from griptape.rules import Rule
from griptape.tasks import PromptTask

task = PromptTask(
    prompt_driver=OpenAiChatPromptDriver(model="gpt-4.1"),
    rules=[Rule("Keep your answer to a few sentences.")],
)

result = task.run("How do I do a kickflip?")

print(result.value)
```

**Output:**

```text
To do a kickflip, start by positioning your front foot slightly angled near the middle of the board and your back foot on the tail.
Pop the tail down with your back foot while flicking the edge of the board with your front foot to make it spin.
Jump and keep your body centered over the board, then catch it with your feet and land smoothly. Practice and patience are key!
```
