## Key Features

*   ü§ñ **Multi-Agent Support:** Manage and deploy multiple AI agents simultaneously.
*   üîÑ **Autonomous Agent Management:** Automate agent workflows and decision-making.
*   üîó **Blockchain Integration:** Interact with EVM-compatible blockchains (with plans for more).
*   üê¶ **Social Media Integration:** Connect with platforms like Twitter and Telegram.
*   üõ†Ô∏è **Extensible Skill System:** Easily integrate custom functionalities and expand agent capabilities.
*   üîå **MCP (WIP):** (Placeholder for future functionality)

## Architecture Overview

IntentKit's architecture is designed for flexibility and extensibility. Agents are built using LangGraph and are connected to various entrypoints (e.g., Twitter, Telegram). They leverage a core system incorporating:

*   **Agent Configuration & Memory:**  Stores agent profiles and data.
*   **Skills:** Includes capabilities for blockchain interaction, wallet management, on-chain actions, internet search, and image processing.
*   **Entrypoints:** Entrypoints for interacting with agents (web, Telegram, Twitter, etc.)

For more detailed information, please refer to the [Architecture](docs/architecture.md) section.
