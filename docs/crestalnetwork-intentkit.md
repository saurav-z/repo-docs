IntentKit is a powerful framework designed to empower developers to create and manage sophisticated AI agents. This framework allows for extensive customization and integration across various platforms, making it ideal for automating tasks, managing social media, and interacting with blockchain technology.

## Key Features

*   **ü§ñ Multi-Agent Support:** Manage and deploy multiple autonomous agents simultaneously.
*   **üîÑ Autonomous Agent Management:** Effortlessly control and orchestrate your AI agents.
*   **üîó Blockchain Integration:** Interact with EVM-compatible blockchains and manage wallets.
*   **üê¶ Social Media Integration:** Connect with platforms like Twitter and Telegram.
*   **üõ†Ô∏è Extensible Skill System:** Easily add custom skills and functionality to your agents.
*   **üîå MCP (WIP):** (More details to come)

## Architecture

IntentKit is built on a modular architecture, allowing for easy expansion and customization. The system includes:

*   **Entrypoints:** Interfaces for interacting with agents (e.g., Twitter, Telegram).
*   **Agent Core:** The central component powered by LangGraph.
*   **Skills:** Including blockchain interaction, social media management, and more.
*   **Storage:** Managing agent configurations, credentials, personality and memory.

For a detailed overview of the architecture, please refer to the [Architecture](docs/architecture.md) documentation.

## Development

Get started with IntentKit development by following the instructions in the [Development Guide](DEVELOPMENT.md).

## Documentation

Comprehensive documentation is available to guide you through the framework. Explore the [Documentation](docs/) for in-depth information.
