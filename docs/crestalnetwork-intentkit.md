## Architecture Overview

IntentKit's architecture allows for flexible integration of various modules:

*   **Entrypoints:** Handle interactions with external services (Twitter, Telegram, etc.).
*   **Skills:** Enable on-chain actions, internet searches, image processing, and more.
*   **Core Agent:** Powered by LangGraph, managing agent behavior and interactions.
*   **Storage:**  Manages agent configurations, credentials, personality, and memory.
