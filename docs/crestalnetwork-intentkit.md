IntentKit is an open-source framework for developing and managing autonomous AI agents, giving you control over their capabilities and actions. This framework allows you to build AI agents with various capabilities, including blockchain interaction, social media management, and custom skill integration.

## Key Features

*   ü§ñ **Multi-Agent Support:** Manage and deploy multiple AI agents simultaneously.
*   üîÑ **Autonomous Agent Management:** Control and monitor your agents' lifecycle.
*   üîó **Blockchain Integration:** Interact with EVM-compatible blockchain networks.
*   üê¶ **Social Media Integration:** Connect with platforms like Twitter, Telegram, and more.
*   üõ†Ô∏è **Extensible Skill System:** Customize agents with a wide range of skills based on LangChain tools.
*   üîå **MCP (WIP):** In development.

## Architecture Overview

IntentKit's architecture is designed for flexibility and extensibility. The system integrates entrypoints for communication (Twitter, Telegram, etc.) with a central agent core powered by LangGraph. This core utilizes storage for agent configuration, credentials, memory, and skill state, and utilizes skills such as chain integration and internet search.

For more details, see the [Architecture](docs/architecture.md) section.
