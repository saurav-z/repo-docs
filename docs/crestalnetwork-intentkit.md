## Architecture

[Diagram of Architecture from Original README]

IntentKit's architecture is designed for flexibility and scalability.  For a deeper dive, explore the [Architecture Documentation](docs/architecture.md).

## Getting Started

### Package Manager Migration Warning

We've recently transitioned to `uv` from `poetry`. To set up your environment:

```bash
rm -rf .venv
uv sync
```

### Development
