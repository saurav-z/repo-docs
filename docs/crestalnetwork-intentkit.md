IntentKit empowers developers to build and deploy AI agents with diverse capabilities, including blockchain interaction, social media management, and custom skill integration. This framework streamlines the development process, providing a robust foundation for creating intelligent, autonomous systems.

## Key Features of IntentKit

*   ü§ñ **Multi-Agent Support:** Manage and deploy multiple AI agents, each with unique roles and responsibilities.
*   üîÑ **Autonomous Agent Management:**  Orchestrate and control your agents' behavior with built-in autonomous management features.
*   üîó **Blockchain Integration:** Seamlessly interact with EVM-compatible blockchain networks for transactions and data access.
*   üê¶ **Social Media Integration:** Connect with platforms like Twitter and Telegram to manage social media presence and engage with users.
*   üõ†Ô∏è **Extensible Skill System:**  Customize your agents' capabilities with a modular skill system, allowing for easy integration of new functionalities.
*   üîå **MCP (WIP):**  [Placeholder - Keep this.  If you know what this is replace with the relevant info.]

## Architecture Overview

IntentKit's architecture is designed for flexibility and scalability. Agents are built on LangGraph and interact with various entrypoints (Twitter, Telegram, etc.).  They leverage a combination of storage (Agent Config, Credentials, Memory), skills (Chain Integration, Internet Search, Image Processing), and core functionalities.  See the [Architecture](docs/architecture.md) section for more in-depth details.

## Getting Started

**1. Environment Setup (Important - Update Your Environment!)**

We've migrated to `uv` from `poetry`.  Follow these steps:

```bash
rm -rf .venv  # Delete the existing virtual environment
uv sync       # Create a new virtual environment
```

**2. Development:**

*   Consult the [Development Guide](DEVELOPMENT.md) for setting up your development environment.

**3. Documentation:**

*   Explore the comprehensive [Documentation](docs/) to learn more about IntentKit's features and capabilities.
*   Access the [Agent API Documentation](docs/agent_api.md) to programmatically interact with your agents.
