# IntentKit: Build Powerful AI Agents for the Modern Web

[![IntentKit by Crestal](docs/images/intentkit_banner.png)](https://github.com/crestalnetwork/intentkit)

**IntentKit empowers you to build and manage intelligent AI agents capable of interacting with blockchains, social media, and custom integrations.**

## Key Features

*   ü§ñ **Multi-Agent Support:** Easily create and manage multiple AI agents.
*   üîÑ **Autonomous Agent Management:** Orchestrate and control agent behaviors.
*   üîó **Blockchain Integration:** Interact with EVM-compatible blockchains.
*   üê¶ **Social Media Integration:** Manage Twitter, Telegram, and more.
*   üõ†Ô∏è **Extensible Skill System:** Customize agents with a wide range of skills.
*   üîå **MCP (WIP):** (WIP - More details in the future.)

## Architecture Overview

IntentKit leverages LangGraph to create a flexible and scalable agent framework. Agents can interact with various entry points (Twitter, Telegram, etc.), utilize storage for configurations and data (Agent Config, Credentials, Personality, Memory, Skill State), and access a diverse set of skills, including:

*   Chain Integration (Wallet Management, On-Chain Actions)
*   Internet Search
*   Image Processing

**For a deeper understanding of the architecture, please refer to the [Architecture Documentation](docs/architecture.md).**

## Package Manager Migration Warning

We've recently migrated from Poetry to `uv`. To ensure a smooth setup, please remove your existing virtual environment and run `uv sync`:

```bash
rm -rf .venv
uv sync
```
