# IntentKit: Build Intelligent Autonomous Agents with Ease

[![IntentKit by Crestal](docs/images/intentkit_banner.png)](https://github.com/crestalnetwork/intentkit)

**IntentKit empowers you to create and manage AI agents capable of complex tasks, including blockchain interactions and social media engagement.**

## Key Features

*   ü§ñ **Multi-Agent Support:** Manage and deploy multiple autonomous agents.
*   üîÑ **Autonomous Agent Management:** Orchestrate and oversee agent operations.
*   üîó **Blockchain Integration:** Interact with EVM-compatible blockchains.
*   üê¶ **Social Media Integration:** Connect agents with platforms like Twitter and Telegram.
*   üõ†Ô∏è **Extensible Skill System:** Customize agent capabilities with a flexible skill architecture.
*   üîå **MCP (WIP):** (Mention of the work in progress feature.)

## Architecture Overview

IntentKit's architecture enables agents to interact with various entrypoints (Twitter, Telegram, etc.) and leverage skills like blockchain integration, internet search, and image processing. Agents are powered by LangGraph and utilize storage for configurations, credentials, personality, memory, and skill states.

[View detailed architecture in the documentation](docs/architecture.md)

## Package Manager Migration Warning

*   **Important:** You need to delete the `.venv` folder and run `uv sync` to create a new virtual environment. (one time)
    ```bash
    rm -rf .venv
    uv sync
    ```
