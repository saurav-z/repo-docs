# IntentKit: Build Autonomous AI Agents with Ease

**IntentKit** empowers you to create and manage powerful AI agents for blockchain interaction, social media management, and more. ([See the original repository](https://github.com/crestalnetwork/intentkit))

## Key Features:

*   ü§ñ **Multiple Agent Support:** Manage and orchestrate multiple autonomous agents.
*   üîÑ **Autonomous Agent Management:** Streamline the lifecycle of your AI agents.
*   üîó **Blockchain Integration:** Interact with EVM-compatible blockchains.
*   üê¶ **Social Media Integration:** Connect with platforms like Twitter and Telegram.
*   üõ†Ô∏è **Extensible Skill System:** Customize agents with a flexible skill architecture.
*   üîå **MCP (WIP):** (Mention of MCP - Mobile Control Panel)

## Architecture Overview

[Image of the IntentKit architecture - removed for brevity, but keep in mind the image should still be here.]

IntentKit's architecture is designed to be modular and extensible. At its core, the system is powered by LangGraph. Agents interact with various entrypoints (Twitter, Telegram, etc.) and leverage a range of skills, including:

*   Chain Integration
*   Wallet Management
*   On-Chain Actions
*   Internet Search
*   Image Processing
*   And more...

Detailed architectural information can be found in the [Architecture](docs/architecture.md) section of the documentation.

## Package Manager Migration Warning

We've recently migrated to `uv` from `poetry`. To update your environment:

```bash
rm -rf .venv
uv sync
```
