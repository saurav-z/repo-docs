IntentKit is designed to enable the rapid development and deployment of AI agents capable of performing complex tasks across various platforms and services. Whether you're looking to automate blockchain interactions, manage social media, or integrate custom skills, IntentKit provides the tools you need.

## Key Features

*   **ü§ñ Multiple Agent Support:** Manage and orchestrate multiple AI agents within a single framework.
*   **üîÑ Autonomous Agent Management:**  Automate the lifecycle and operations of your AI agents.
*   **üîó Blockchain Integration:** Interact with EVM-compatible blockchain networks.
*   **üê¶ Social Media Integration:** Seamlessly manage and interact with platforms like Twitter and Telegram.
*   **üõ†Ô∏è Extensible Skill System:**  Add new capabilities and functionalities with a flexible skill architecture.
*   **üîå MCP (WIP):**  (Mention what this is or remove if unclear)

## Architecture

IntentKit's architecture is designed for flexibility and scalability. The core components include:

*   **Entrypoints:** Interfaces for interacting with agents (e.g., Twitter, Telegram).
*   **Agent Core:** Powered by LangGraph, managing agent logic and interactions.
*   **Skills:**  Extend agent capabilities through integrations like Chain Integration, Internet Search, Image Processing, etc.
*   **Storage:** Agent Config, Credentials, Personality, Memory, Skill State.

For a more detailed understanding, explore the [Architecture](docs/architecture.md) documentation.

## Getting Started

### Package Manager Migration

**Important:**  We've migrated to `uv` from `poetry`.  Follow these steps to update your environment:

```bash
rm -rf .venv
uv sync
```
