## Key Features

*   ü§ñ **Multi-Agent Support:** Manage multiple autonomous agents concurrently.
*   üîÑ **Autonomous Agent Management:** Efficiently control and orchestrate your AI agents.
*   üîó **Blockchain Integration:** Interact with EVM-compatible blockchains.
*   üê¶ **Social Media Integration:** Connect with platforms like Twitter, Telegram, and more.
*   üõ†Ô∏è **Extensible Skill System:** Easily integrate custom functionalities and capabilities.
*   üîå **MCP (WIP):**  Modular Component Protocol for advanced agent design.

## Architecture

IntentKit's architecture is designed for flexibility and extensibility.  The core of the system leverages LangGraph for agent management, integrating various components:

*   **Entrypoints:**  Handles interactions from various sources (Twitter, Telegram, etc.).
*   **Storage:** Manages agent configurations, credentials, personality, memory, and skill states.
*   **Skills:** Enables a broad range of agent capabilities, including:
    *   Chain Integration
    *   Wallet Management
    *   On-Chain Actions
    *   Internet Search
    *   Image Processing
    *   And more...

For a detailed architectural overview, refer to the [Architecture](docs/architecture.md) section.
