IntentKit is an open-source framework that empowers you to build and deploy AI agents capable of a wide range of tasks, from blockchain interaction to social media management and beyond.

## Key Features

*   **ü§ñ Multiple Agent Support:** Manage and deploy multiple AI agents simultaneously.
*   **üîÑ Autonomous Agent Management:** Oversee the lifecycle and operations of your AI agents.
*   **üîó Blockchain Integration:** Interact seamlessly with EVM-compatible blockchain networks.
*   **üê¶ Social Media Integration:** Connect with platforms like Twitter and Telegram.
*   **üõ†Ô∏è Extensible Skill System:** Easily integrate custom skills and functionalities.
*   **üîå MCP (WIP):** (Mention of this feature. Consider removing this from the summary, or adding a full sentence if there is enough context.)

## Architecture Overview

IntentKit's architecture is built around a core agent system driven by LangGraph. Agents interact with various entrypoints (e.g., Twitter, Telegram) and leverage a range of skills and integrations. The system includes:

*   **Entrypoints:** Handles interactions with external platforms (e.g., Twitter, Telegram).
*   **Core Agent:** Powered by LangGraph, manages agent logic and workflows.
*   **Skills:** Provides specialized functionalities, including:
    *   Chain Integration (Wallet Management, On-Chain Actions)
    *   Internet Search
    *   Image Processing
*   **Storage:** Stores Agent Config, Credentials, Personality, Memory, Skill State
*   **Agent Config & Memory:** The configurations and memory of each agent

For a more detailed view, refer to the [Architecture](docs/architecture.md) documentation.
