IntentKit is an autonomous agent framework designed to simplify the development and management of AI agents capable of diverse tasks.  It empowers developers to create agents that can interact with various platforms, including blockchain, social media, and custom-built skills.

## Key Features

*   **ü§ñ Multiple Agent Support:**  Easily manage and deploy multiple autonomous agents.
*   **üîÑ Autonomous Agent Management:** Streamline the lifecycle of your AI agents.
*   **üîó Blockchain Integration:** Interact with EVM-compatible blockchains to execute transactions and access data.
*   **üê¶ Social Media Integration:** Connect with platforms like Twitter and Telegram to manage social media presence and automate tasks.
*   **üõ†Ô∏è Extensible Skill System:** Build and integrate custom skills to expand agent capabilities.
*   **üîå MCP (WIP):**  (Placeholder for future functionality)

## Architecture

IntentKit is built around a modular architecture, enabling flexible and scalable agent development.  Core components include:

*   **Entrypoints:**  Interact with agents through various channels (Twitter, Telegram, Web, etc.).
*   **Agent Core:** Powered by LangGraph, the central processing unit for your agents.
*   **Storage:**  Manages agent configuration, credentials, personality, and memory.
*   **Skills:**  Provide specific functionalities, such as blockchain interaction, social media management, internet searches, and image processing.

For a more in-depth understanding, refer to the detailed [Architecture](docs/architecture.md) documentation.
