## Key Features

*   ü§ñ **Multi-Agent Support:**  Manage and deploy multiple autonomous AI agents.
*   üîÑ **Autonomous Agent Management:**  Control and oversee agent behavior and lifecycles.
*   üîó **Blockchain Integration:** Seamlessly interact with EVM-compatible blockchains (with broader support planned).
*   üê¶ **Social Media Integration:**  Connect with and manage social media platforms like Twitter and Telegram.
*   üõ†Ô∏è **Extensible Skill System:**  Customize agents with a wide range of skills and capabilities.
*   üîå **MCP (WIP):** (Details on this feature coming soon.)

## Architecture Overview

IntentKit is designed with a modular architecture, enabling flexibility and scalability.  The core agent system, powered by LangGraph, interacts with various entrypoints (like social media) and leverages a robust set of components:

*   **Entrypoints:** Handles interactions with the outside world (Twitter, Telegram, etc.).
*   **Storage:** Manages agent configurations, credentials, and memory.
*   **Skills:**  Provides agents with capabilities like chain integration, wallet management, on-chain actions, internet search, and image processing.

For a more in-depth understanding, please refer to the [Architecture](docs/architecture.md) documentation.
