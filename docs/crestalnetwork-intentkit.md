## Key Features of IntentKit

*   ü§ñ **Multi-Agent Support:** Manage and orchestrate multiple autonomous AI agents.
*   üîÑ **Autonomous Agent Management:**  Simplified lifecycle management and control over your agents.
*   üîó **Blockchain Integration:** Seamlessly interact with EVM-compatible blockchains (and more to come).
*   üê¶ **Social Media Integration:**  Connect with platforms like Twitter and Telegram to interact with your audience.
*   üõ†Ô∏è **Extensible Skill System:** Easily add new capabilities and customize agent behavior.
*   üîå **MCP (WIP):** (Work In Progress)

## Architecture

IntentKit's architecture is designed for flexibility and extensibility. It allows agents to interact with various entrypoints (social media, etc.), leverage a robust skill system, and utilize storage for configuration, credentials, and memory management, all powered by LangGraph.

*   See [Architecture](docs/architecture.md) for more details.

## Development

### Package Manager Migration Warning

**Important:** We've switched to `uv` from poetry.

1.  Delete the existing virtual environment: `rm -rf .venv`
2.  Create a new virtual environment: `uv sync`

### Getting Started

*   Read the [Development Guide](DEVELOPMENT.md) to set up your environment.
*   Explore the [Documentation](docs/) to learn how to use IntentKit.
