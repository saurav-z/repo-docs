# IntentKit: Build Intelligent AI Agents for the Web3 World

**Empower your projects with autonomous AI agents capable of blockchain interaction, social media management, and custom skill integration.**

[<img src="docs/images/intentkit_banner.png" alt="IntentKit by Crestal" width="100%">](https://github.com/crestalnetwork/intentkit)

IntentKit is a powerful, open-source framework designed for building and managing AI agents. These agents can perform a wide range of tasks, from interacting with EVM-compatible blockchains to managing your social media presence, and integrating with custom-built skills. Leverage IntentKit to automate complex workflows and create intelligent applications.

## Key Features of IntentKit

*   ü§ñ **Multiple Agent Support:** Manage and deploy multiple AI agents simultaneously.
*   üîÑ **Autonomous Agent Management:** Orchestrate and control your agents' behavior.
*   üîó **Blockchain Integration:** Seamlessly interact with EVM-compatible blockchains.
*   üê¶ **Social Media Integration:** Connect and manage your presence on platforms like Twitter and Telegram.
*   üõ†Ô∏è **Extensible Skill System:** Easily add new skills and functionalities to your agents.
*   üîå **MCP (WIP):**  [Awaiting clarification/expansion on this feature.]

## Architecture Overview

[Include a simplified version of the provided architecture diagram here, or a text description if a visual is not possible.]

IntentKit utilizes a modular architecture built around a core agent system, powered by LangGraph. This allows agents to process various inputs, utilize different skills, and interact with external services. Detailed architecture information can be found in the [Architecture](docs/architecture.md) section.

## Getting Started

### Package Manager Migration Warning

Due to recent changes, you must delete the `.venv` folder and run `uv sync` to create a new virtual environment. This is a one-time requirement.

```bash
rm -rf .venv
uv sync
```

### Development Setup

Get up and running quickly with the detailed instructions in our [Development Guide](DEVELOPMENT.md).

### Comprehensive Documentation

Explore all the features and functionality of IntentKit with our in-depth [Documentation](docs/).
