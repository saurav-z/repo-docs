Isaac Lab, built on NVIDIA Isaac Sim, provides a unified environment for reinforcement learning, imitation learning, and motion planning, featuring fast and accurate physics and sensor simulation for efficient sim-to-real transfer.

## Key Features:

*   **Diverse Robot Models:** Access a library of 16 pre-built robot models, including manipulators, quadrupeds, and humanoids.
*   **Rich Environments:** Train your robots in over 30 ready-to-use environments, compatible with popular RL frameworks (RSL RL, SKRL, RL Games, Stable Baselines) and multi-agent RL.
*   **Advanced Physics Engine:** Simulate rigid bodies, articulated systems, and deformable objects with high fidelity.
*   **Realistic Sensor Simulation:** Utilize RTX-based cameras, LIDAR, IMU, contact sensors, and ray casters for accurate data acquisition.
*   **GPU Acceleration:** Benefit from GPU acceleration for faster simulation and computation, enabling rapid iteration in RL and data-intensive tasks.
*   **Flexible Deployment:** Run simulations locally or distribute them across the cloud for scalability.
