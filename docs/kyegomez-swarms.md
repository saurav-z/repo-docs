## Getting Started: Build Your First Agent

An **Agent** is the core building block of a swarm ‚Äì an autonomous entity powered by an LLM + Tools + Memory.  [Learn more Here](https://docs.swarms.world/en/latest/swarms/structs/agent/)

```python
from swarms import Agent

# Initialize a new agent
agent = Agent(
    model_name="gpt-4o-mini",  # Specify the LLM
    max_loops=1,  # Set the number of interactions
    interactive=True,  # Enable interactive mode for real-time feedback
)

# Run the agent with a task
agent.run("What are the key benefits of using a multi-agent system?")
```

## Multi-Agent Collaboration: Your First Swarm

A **Swarm** consists of multiple agents working together. This simple example creates a two-agent workflow for researching and writing a blog post.  [Learn More About SequentialWorkflow](https://docs.swarms.world/en/latest/swarms/structs/sequential_workflow/)

```python
from swarms import Agent, SequentialWorkflow

# Agent 1: The Researcher
researcher = Agent(
    agent_name="Researcher",
    system_prompt="Your job is to research the provided topic and provide a detailed summary.",
    model_name="gpt-4o-mini",
)

# Agent 2: The Writer
writer = Agent(
    agent_name="Writer",
    system_prompt="Your job is to take the research summary and write a beautiful, engaging blog post about it.",
    model_name="gpt-4o-mini",
)

# Create a sequential workflow where the researcher's output feeds into the writer's input
workflow = SequentialWorkflow(agents=[researcher, writer])

# Run the workflow on a task
final_post = workflow.run("The history and future of artificial intelligence")
print(final_post)
```

-----

### SequentialWorkflow

A `SequentialWorkflow` executes tasks in a strict order, forming a pipeline where each agent builds upon the work of the previous one.  Ideal for processes with clear, ordered steps, ensuring that tasks with dependencies are handled correctly.

```python
from swarms import Agent, SequentialWorkflow

# Initialize agents for a 3-step process
# 1. Generate an idea
idea_generator = Agent(agent_name="IdeaGenerator", system_prompt="Generate a unique startup idea.", model_name="gpt-4o-mini")
# 2. Validate the idea
validator = Agent(agent_name="Validator", system_prompt="Take this startup idea and analyze its market viability.", model_name="gpt-4o-mini")
# 3. Create a pitch
pitch_creator = Agent(agent_name="PitchCreator", system_prompt="Write a 3-sentence elevator pitch for this validated startup idea.", model_name="gpt-4o-mini")

# Create the sequential workflow
workflow = SequentialWorkflow(agents=[idea_generator, validator, pitch_creator])

# Run the workflow
elevator_pitch = workflow.run()
print(elevator_pitch)
```

-----

### ConcurrentWorkflow (with `SpreadSheetSwarm`)

A concurrent workflow runs multiple agents simultaneously. `SpreadSheetSwarm` can manage thousands of concurrent agents and log their outputs to a CSV file. Use this for high-throughput tasks that can be performed in parallel, reducing execution time.

```python
from swarms import Agent, SpreadSheetSwarm

# Define a list of tasks (e.g., social media posts to generate)
platforms = ["Twitter", "LinkedIn", "Instagram"]

# Create an agent for each task
agents = [
    Agent(
        agent_name=f"{platform}-Marketer",
        system_prompt=f"Generate a real estate marketing post for {platform}.",
        model_name="gpt-4o-mini",
    )
    for platform in platforms
]

# Initialize the swarm to run these agents concurrently
swarm = SpreadSheetSwarm(
    agents=agents,
    autosave_on=True,
    save_file_path="marketing_posts.csv",
)

# Run the swarm with a single, shared task description
property_description = "A beautiful 3-bedroom house in sunny California."
swarm.run(task=f"Generate a post about: {property_description}")
# Check marketing_posts.csv for the results!
```

---

### AgentRearrange

Inspired by `einsum`, `AgentRearrange` lets you define complex, non-linear relationships between agents using a simple string-based syntax.  [Learn more](https://docs.swarms.world/en/latest/swarms/structs/agent_rearrange/). This architecture is Perfect for orchestrating dynamic workflows.

```python
from swarms import Agent, AgentRearrange

# Define agents
researcher = Agent(agent_name="researcher", model_name="gpt-4o-mini")
writer = Agent(agent_name="writer", model_name="gpt-4o-mini")
editor = Agent(agent_name="editor", model_name="gpt-4o-mini")

# Define a flow: researcher sends work to both writer and editor simultaneously
# This is a one-to-many relationship
flow = "researcher -> writer, editor"

# Create the rearrangement system
rearrange_system = AgentRearrange(
    agents=[researcher, writer, editor],
    flow=flow,
)

# Run the system
# The researcher will generate content, and then both the writer and editor
# will process that content in parallel.
outputs = rearrange_system.run("Analyze the impact of AI on modern cinema.")
print(outputs)
```

### SwarmRouter: The Universal Swarm Orchestrator

The `SwarmRouter` simplifies building complex workflows by providing a single interface to run any type of swarm.  Instead of importing and managing different swarm classes, you can dynamically select the one you need just by changing the `swarm_type` parameter.  [Read the full documentation](https://docs.swarms.world/en/latest/swarms/structs/swarm_router/)

```python
from swarms import Agent
from swarms.structs.swarm_router import SwarmRouter, SwarmType

# Define a few generic agents
writer = Agent(agent_name="Writer", system_prompt="You are a creative writer.", model_name="gpt-4o-mini")
editor = Agent(agent_name="Editor", system_prompt="You are an expert editor for stories.", model_name="gpt-4o-mini")
reviewer = Agent(agent_name="Reviewer", system_prompt="You are a final reviewer who gives a score.", model_name="gpt-4o-mini")

# The agents and task will be the same for all examples
agents = [writer, editor, reviewer]
task = "Write a short story about a robot who discovers music."

# --- Example 1: SequentialWorkflow ---
# Agents run one after another in a chain: Writer -> Editor -> Reviewer.
print("Running a Sequential Workflow...")
sequential_router = SwarmRouter(swarm_type=SwarmType.SequentialWorkflow, agents=agents)
sequential_output = sequential_router.run(task)
print(f"Final Sequential Output:\n{sequential_output}\n")

# --- Example 2: ConcurrentWorkflow ---
# All agents receive the same initial task and run at the same time.
print("Running a Concurrent Workflow...")
concurrent_router = SwarmRouter(swarm_type=SwarmType.ConcurrentWorkflow, agents=agents)
concurrent_outputs = concurrent_router.run(task)
# This returns a dictionary of each agent's output
for agent_name, output in concurrent_outputs.items():
    print(f"Output from {agent_name}:\n{output}\n")

# --- Example 3: MixtureOfAgents ---
# All agents run in parallel, and a special 'aggregator' agent synthesizes their outputs.
print("Running a Mixture of Agents Workflow...")
aggregator = Agent(
    agent_name="Aggregator",
    system_prompt="Combine the story, edits, and review into a final document.",
    model_name="gpt-4o-mini"
)
moa_router = SwarmRouter(
    swarm_type=SwarmType.MixtureOfAgents,
    agents=agents,
    aggregator_agent=aggregator, # MoA requires an aggregator
)
aggregated_output = moa_router.run(task)
print(f"Final Aggregated Output:\n{aggregated_output}\n")
```

-------

### MixtureOfAgents (MoA)

The `MixtureOfAgents` architecture processes tasks by feeding them to multiple "expert" agents in parallel, then synthesizing their outputs.  [Learn more here](https://docs.swarms.world/en/latest/swarms/examples/moa_example/)

```python
from swarms import Agent, MixtureOfAgents

# Define expert agents
financial_analyst = Agent(agent_name="FinancialAnalyst", system_prompt="Analyze financial data.", model_name="gpt-4o-mini")
market_analyst = Agent(agent_name="MarketAnalyst", system_prompt="Analyze market trends.", model_name="gpt-4o-mini")
risk_analyst = Agent(agent_name="RiskAnalyst", system_prompt="Analyze investment risks.", model_name="gpt-4o-mini")

# Define the aggregator agent
aggregator = Agent(
    agent_name="InvestmentAdvisor",
    system_prompt="Synthesize the financial, market, and risk analyses to provide a final investment recommendation.",
    model_name="gpt-4o-mini"
)

# Create the MoA swarm
moa_swarm = MixtureOfAgents(
    agents=[financial_analyst, market_analyst, risk_analyst],
    aggregator_agent=aggregator,
)

# Run the swarm
recommendation = moa_swarm.run("Should we invest in NVIDIA stock right now?")
print(recommendation)
```

----

### GroupChat

`GroupChat` creates a conversational environment for multiple agents to interact.  Ideal for tasks that benefit from debate and multi-perspective reasoning.

```python
from swarms import Agent, GroupChat

# Define agents for a debate
tech_optimist = Agent(agent_name="TechOptimist", system_prompt="Argue for the benefits of AI in society.", model_name="gpt-4o-mini")
tech_critic = Agent(agent_name="TechCritic", system_prompt="Argue against the unchecked advancement of AI.", model_name="gpt-4o-mini")

# Create the group chat
chat = GroupChat(
    agents=[tech_optimist, tech_critic],
    max_loops=4, # Limit the number of turns in the conversation
)

# Run the chat with an initial topic
conversation_history = chat.run(
    "Let's discuss the societal impact of artificial intelligence."
)

# Print the full conversation
for message in conversation_history:
    print(f"[{message['agent_name']}]: {message['content']}")
```
