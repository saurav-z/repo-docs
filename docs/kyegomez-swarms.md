```python
from swarms import Agent, SequentialWorkflow

# Agent 1: The Researcher
researcher = Agent(
    agent_name="Researcher",
    system_prompt="Your job is to research the provided topic and provide a detailed summary.",
    model_name="gpt-4o-mini",
)

# Agent 2: The Writer
writer = Agent(
    agent_name="Writer",
    system_prompt="Your job is to take the research summary and write a beautiful, engaging blog post about it.",
    model_name="gpt-4o-mini",
)

# Create a sequential workflow where the researcher's output feeds into the writer's input
workflow = SequentialWorkflow(agents=[researcher, writer])

# Run the workflow on a task
final_post = workflow.run("The history and future of artificial intelligence")
print(final_post)
```

-----

### ConcurrentWorkflow

Run multiple agents simultaneously for parallel task execution.

```python
from swarms import Agent, ConcurrentWorkflow

# Create agents for different analysis tasks
market_analyst = Agent(
    agent_name="Market-Analyst",
    system_prompt="Analyze market trends and provide insights on the given topic.",
    model_name="gpt-4o-mini",
    max_loops=1,
)

financial_analyst = Agent(
    agent_name="Financial-Analyst", 
    system_prompt="Provide financial analysis and recommendations on the given topic.",
    model_name="gpt-4o-mini",
    max_loops=1,
)

risk_analyst = Agent(
    agent_name="Risk-Analyst",
    system_prompt="Assess risks and provide risk management strategies for the given topic.",
    model_name="gpt-4o-mini", 
    max_loops=1,
)

# Create concurrent workflow
concurrent_workflow = ConcurrentWorkflow(
    agents=[market_analyst, financial_analyst, risk_analyst],
    max_loops=1,
)

# Run all agents concurrently on the same task
results = concurrent_workflow.run(
    "Analyze the potential impact of AI technology on the healthcare industry"
)

print(results)
```

---

### AgentRearrange

Define non-linear agent relationships using a simple syntax.  [Learn more](https://docs.swarms.world/en/latest/swarms/structs/agent_rearrange/).

```python
from swarms import Agent, AgentRearrange

# Define agents
researcher = Agent(agent_name="researcher", model_name="gpt-4o-mini")
writer = Agent(agent_name="writer", model_name="gpt-4o-mini")
editor = Agent(agent_name="editor", model_name="gpt-4o-mini")

# Define a flow: researcher sends work to both writer and editor simultaneously
# This is a one-to-many relationship
flow = "researcher -> writer, editor"

# Create the rearrangement system
rearrange_system = AgentRearrange(
    agents=[researcher, writer, editor],
    flow=flow,
)

# Run the swarm
outputs = rearrange_system.run("Analyze the impact of AI on modern cinema.")
print(outputs)
```

### SwarmRouter: The Universal Swarm Orchestrator

Simplify complex workflows by using a single interface for running any type of swarm. [Read the full documentation](https://docs.swarms.world/en/latest/swarms/structs/swarm_router/)

```python
from swarms import Agent
from swarms.structs.swarm_router import SwarmRouter, SwarmType

# Define a few generic agents
writer = Agent(agent_name="Writer", system_prompt="You are a creative writer.", model_name="gpt-4o-mini")
editor = Agent(agent_name="Editor", system_prompt="You are an expert editor for stories.", model_name="gpt-4o-mini")
reviewer = Agent(agent_name="Reviewer", system_prompt="You are a final reviewer who gives a score.", model_name="gpt-4o-mini")

# The agents and task will be the same for all examples
agents = [writer, editor, reviewer]
task = "Write a short story about a robot who discovers music."

# --- Example 1: SequentialWorkflow ---
# Agents run one after another in a chain: Writer -> Editor -> Reviewer.
print("Running a Sequential Workflow...")
sequential_router = SwarmRouter(swarm_type=SwarmType.SequentialWorkflow, agents=agents)
sequential_output = sequential_router.run(task)
print(f"Final Sequential Output:\n{sequential_output}\n")

# --- Example 2: ConcurrentWorkflow ---
# All agents receive the same initial task and run at the same time.
print("Running a Concurrent Workflow...")
concurrent_router = SwarmRouter(swarm_type=SwarmType.ConcurrentWorkflow, agents=agents)
concurrent_outputs = concurrent_router.run(task)
# This returns a dictionary of each agent's output
for agent_name, output in concurrent_outputs.items():
    print(f"Output from {agent_name}:\n{output}\n")

# --- Example 3: MixtureOfAgents ---
# All agents run in parallel, and a special 'aggregator' agent synthesizes their outputs.
print("Running a Mixture of Agents Workflow...")
aggregator = Agent(
    agent_name="Aggregator",
    system_prompt="Combine the story, edits, and review into a final document.",
    model_name="gpt-4o-mini"
)
moa_router = SwarmRouter(
    swarm_type=SwarmType.MixtureOfAgents,
    agents=agents,
    aggregator_agent=aggregator, # MoA requires an aggregator
)
