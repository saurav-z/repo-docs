## Your First Agent

An **Agent** is the fundamental building block of a swarm‚Äîan autonomous entity powered by an LLM + Tools + Memory. [Learn more Here](https://docs.swarms.world/en/latest/swarms/structs/agent/)

```python
from swarms import Agent

# Initialize a new agent
agent = Agent(
    model_name="gpt-4o-mini", # Specify the LLM
    max_loops="auto",              # Set the number of interactions
    interactive=True,         # Enable interactive mode for real-time feedback
)

# Run the agent with a task
agent.run("What are the key benefits of using a multi-agent system?")
```

---

## Your First Swarm: Multi-Agent Collaboration

A **Swarm** consists of multiple agents working together. This simple example creates a two-agent workflow for researching and writing a blog post. [Learn More About SequentialWorkflow](https://docs.swarms.world/en/latest/swarms/structs/sequential_workflow/)

```python
from swarms import Agent, SequentialWorkflow

# Agent 1: The Researcher
researcher = Agent(
    agent_name="Researcher",
    system_prompt="Your job is to research the provided topic and provide a detailed summary.",
    model_name="gpt-4o-mini",
)

# Agent 2: The Writer
writer = Agent(
    agent_name="Writer",
    system_prompt="Your job is to take the research summary and write a beautiful, engaging blog post about it.",
    model_name="gpt-4o-mini",
)

# Create a sequential workflow where the researcher's output feeds into the writer's input
workflow = SequentialWorkflow(agents=[researcher, writer])

# Run the workflow on a task
final_post = workflow.run("The history and future of artificial intelligence")
print(final_post)

```

---

## AutoSwarmBuilder: Autonomous Agent Generation

The `AutoSwarmBuilder` automatically generates specialized agents and their workflows based on your task description. Simply describe what you need, and it will create a complete multi-agent system with detailed prompts and optimal agent configurations. [Learn more about AutoSwarmBuilder](https://docs.swarms.world/en/latest/swarms/structs/auto_swarm_builder/)

```python
from swarms.structs.auto_swarm_builder import AutoSwarmBuilder
import json

# Initialize the AutoSwarmBuilder
swarm = AutoSwarmBuilder(
    name="My Swarm",
    description="A swarm of agents",
    verbose=True,
    max_loops=1,
    return_agents=True,
    model_name="gpt-4o-mini",
)

# Let the builder automatically create agents and workflows
result = swarm.run(
    task="Create an accounting team to analyze crypto transactions, "
         "there must be 5 agents in the team with extremely extensive prompts. "
         "Make the prompts extremely detailed and specific and long and comprehensive. "
         "Make sure to include all the details of the task in the prompts."
)

# The result contains the generated agents and their configurations
print(json.dumps(result, indent=4))
```

The `AutoSwarmBuilder` provides:

-   **Automatic Agent Generation**: Creates specialized agents based on task requirements
-   **Intelligent Prompt Engineering**: Generates comprehensive, detailed prompts for each agent

### SequentialWorkflow

A `SequentialWorkflow` executes tasks in a strict order, forming a pipeline where each agent builds upon the work of the previous one. `SequentialWorkflow` is Ideal for processes that have clear, ordered steps. This ensures that tasks with dependencies are handled correctly.

```python
from swarms import Agent, SequentialWorkflow

# Agent 1: The Researcher
researcher = Agent(
    agent_name="Researcher",
    system_prompt="Your job is to research the provided topic and provide a detailed summary.",
    model_name="gpt-4o-mini",
)

# Agent 2: The Writer
writer = Agent(
    agent_name="Writer",
    system_prompt="Your job is to take the research summary and write a beautiful, engaging blog post about it.",
    model_name="gpt-4o-mini",
)

# Create a sequential workflow where the researcher's output feeds into the writer's input
workflow = SequentialWorkflow(agents=[researcher, writer])

# Run the workflow on a task
final_post = workflow.run("The history and future of artificial intelligence")
print(final_post)
```

---

### ConcurrentWorkflow

A `ConcurrentWorkflow` runs multiple agents simultaneously, allowing for parallel execution of tasks. This architecture drastically reduces execution time for tasks that can be performed in parallel, making it ideal for high-throughput scenarios where agents work on similar tasks concurrently.

```python
from swarms import Agent, ConcurrentWorkflow

# Create agents for different analysis tasks
market_analyst = Agent(
    agent_name="Market-Analyst",
    system_prompt="Analyze market trends and provide insights on the given topic.",
    model_name="gpt-4o-mini",
    max_loops=1,
)

financial_analyst = Agent(
    agent_name="Financial-Analyst", 
    system_prompt="Provide financial analysis and recommendations on the given topic.",
    model_name="gpt-4o-mini",
    max_loops=1,
)

risk_analyst = Agent(
    agent_name="Risk-Analyst",
    system_prompt="Assess risks and provide risk management strategies for the given topic.",
    model_name="gpt-4o-mini", 
    max_loops=1,
)

# Create concurrent workflow
concurrent_workflow = ConcurrentWorkflow(
    agents=[market_analyst, financial_analyst, risk_analyst],
    max_loops=1,
)

# Run all agents concurrently on the same task
results = concurrent_workflow.run(
    "Analyze the potential impact of AI technology on the healthcare industry"
)

print(results)
```

---

### AgentRearrange

Inspired by `einsum`, `AgentRearrange` lets you define complex, non-linear relationships between agents using a simple string-based syntax. [Learn more](https://docs.swarms.world/en/latest/swarms/structs/agent_rearrange/). This architecture is perfect for orchestrating dynamic workflows where agents might work in parallel, in sequence, or in any combination you choose.

```python
from swarms import Agent, AgentRearrange

# Define agents
researcher = Agent(agent_name="researcher", model_name="gpt-4o-mini")
writer = Agent(agent_name="writer", model_name="gpt-4o-mini")
editor = Agent(agent_name="editor", model_name="gpt-4o-mini")

# Define a flow: researcher sends work to both writer and editor simultaneously
# This is a one-to-many relationship
flow = "researcher -> writer, editor"

# Create the rearrangement system
rearrange_system = AgentRearrange(
    agents=[researcher, writer, editor],
    flow=flow,
)

# Run the swarm
outputs = rearrange_system.run("Analyze the impact of AI on modern cinema.")
print(outputs)
```

---

### SwarmRouter: The Universal Swarm Orchestrator

The `SwarmRouter` simplifies building complex workflows by providing a single interface to run any type of swarm. Instead of importing and managing different swarm classes, you can dynamically select the one you need just by changing the `swarm_type` parameter. [Read the full documentation](https://docs.swarms.world/en/latest/swarms/structs/swarm_router/)

This makes your code cleaner and more flexible, allowing you to switch between different multi-agent strategies with ease. Here's a complete example that shows how to define agents and then use `SwarmRouter` to execute the same task using different collaborative strategies.

```python
from swarms import Agent
from swarms.structs.swarm_router import SwarmRouter, SwarmType

# Define a few generic agents
writer = Agent(agent_name="Writer", system_prompt="You are a creative writer.", model_name="gpt-4o-mini")
editor = Agent(agent_name="Editor", system_prompt="You are an expert editor for stories.", model_name="gpt-4o-mini")
reviewer = Agent(agent_name="Reviewer", system_prompt="You are a final reviewer who gives a score.", model_name="gpt-4o-mini")

# The agents and task will be the same for all examples
agents = [writer, editor, reviewer]
task = "Write a short story about a robot who discovers music."

# --- Example 1: SequentialWorkflow ---
# Agents run one after another in a chain: Writer -> Editor -> Reviewer.
print("Running a Sequential Workflow...")
sequential_router = SwarmRouter(swarm_type=SwarmType.SequentialWorkflow, agents=agents)
sequential_output = sequential_router.run(task)
print(f"Final Sequential Output:\n{sequential_output}\n")

# --- Example 2: ConcurrentWorkflow ---
# All agents receive the same initial task and run at the same time.
print("Running a Concurrent Workflow...")
concurrent_router = SwarmRouter(swarm_type=SwarmType.ConcurrentWorkflow, agents=agents)
concurrent_outputs = concurrent_router.run(task)
# This returns a dictionary of each agent's output
for agent_name, output in concurrent_outputs.items():
    print(f"Output from {agent_name}:\n{output}\n")

# --- Example 3: MixtureOfAgents ---
# All agents run in parallel, and a special 'aggregator' agent synthesizes their outputs.
print("Running a Mixture of Agents Workflow...")
aggregator = Agent(
    agent_name="Aggregator",
    system_prompt="Combine the story, edits, and review into a final document.",
    model_name="gpt-4o-mini"
)
moa_router = SwarmRouter(
    swarm_type=SwarmType.MixtureOfAgents,
    agents=agents,
    aggregator_agent=aggregator, # MoA requires an aggregator
)
aggregated_output = moa_router.run(task)
print(f"Final Aggregated Output:\n{aggregated_output}\n")
```

The `SwarmRouter` is a powerful tool for simplifying multi-agent orchestration. It provides a consistent and flexible way to deploy different collaborative strategies, allowing you to build more sophisticated applications with less code.

---

### MixtureOfAgents (MoA)

The `MixtureOfAgents` architecture processes tasks by feeding them to multiple "expert" agents in parallel. Their diverse outputs are then synthesized by an aggregator agent to produce a final, high-quality result. [Learn more here](https://docs.swarms.world/en/latest/swarms/examples/moa_example/)

```python
from swarms import Agent, MixtureOfAgents

# Define expert agents
financial_analyst = Agent(agent_name="FinancialAnalyst", system_prompt="Analyze financial data.", model_name="gpt-4o-mini")
market_analyst = Agent(agent_name="MarketAnalyst", system_prompt="Analyze market trends.", model_name="gpt-4o-mini")
risk_analyst = Agent(agent_name="RiskAnalyst", system_prompt="Analyze investment risks.", model_name="gpt-4o-mini")

# Define the aggregator agent
aggregator = Agent(
    agent_name="InvestmentAdvisor",
    system_prompt="Synthesize the financial, market, and risk analyses to provide a final investment recommendation.",
    model_name="gpt-4o-mini"
)

# Create the MoA swarm
moa_swarm = MixtureOfAgents(
    agents=[financial_analyst, market_analyst, risk_analyst],
    aggregator_agent=aggregator,
)

# Run the swarm
recommendation = moa_swarm.run("Should we invest in NVIDIA stock right now?")
print(recommendation)
```

---

### GroupChat

`GroupChat` creates a conversational environment where multiple agents can interact, discuss, and collaboratively solve a problem. You can define the speaking order or let it be determined dynamically. This architecture is ideal for tasks that benefit from debate and multi-perspective reasoning, such as contract negotiation, brainstorming, or complex decision-making.

```python
from swarms import Agent, GroupChat

# Define agents for a debate
tech_optimist = Agent(agent_name="TechOptimist", system_prompt="Argue for the benefits of AI in society.", model_name="gpt-4o-mini")
tech_critic = Agent(agent_name="TechCritic", system_prompt="Argue against the unchecked advancement of AI.", model_name="gpt-4o-mini")

# Create the group chat
chat = GroupChat(
    agents=[tech_optimist, tech_critic],
    max_loops=4, # Limit the number of turns in the conversation
)

# Run the chat with an initial topic
conversation_history = chat.run(
    "Let's discuss the societal impact of artificial intelligence."
)

# Print the full conversation
for message in conversation_history:
    print(f"[{message['agent_name']}]: {message['content']}")
```

---

### HierarchicalSwarm

`HierarchicalSwarm` implements a director-worker pattern where a central director agent creates comprehensive plans and distributes specific tasks to specialized worker agents. The director evaluates results and can issue new orders in feedback loops, making it ideal for complex project management and team coordination scenarios.

```python
from swarms import Agent, HierarchicalSwarm

# Define specialized worker agents
content_strategist = Agent(
    agent_name="Content-Strategist",
    system_prompt="You are a senior content strategist. Develop comprehensive content strategies, editorial calendars, and content roadmaps.",
    model_name="gpt-4o-mini"
)

creative_director = Agent(
    agent_name="Creative-Director", 
    system_prompt="You are a creative director. Develop compelling advertising concepts, visual directions, and campaign creativity.",
    model_name="gpt-4o-mini"
)

seo_specialist = Agent(
    agent_name="SEO-Specialist",
    system_prompt="You are an SEO expert. Conduct keyword research, optimize content, and develop organic growth strategies.",
    model_name="gpt-4o-mini"
)

brand_strategist = Agent(
    agent_name="Brand-Strategist",
    system_prompt="You are a brand strategist. Develop brand positioning, identity systems, and market differentiation strategies.",
    model_name="gpt-4o-mini"
)

# Create the hierarchical swarm with a director

### HeavySwarm

`HeavySwarm` implements a sophisticated 5-phase workflow inspired by X.AI's Grok heavy implementation. It uses specialized agents (Research, Analysis, Alternatives, Verification) to provide comprehensive task analysis through intelligent question generation, parallel execution, and synthesis. This architecture excels at complex research and analysis tasks requiring thorough investigation and multiple perspectives.

```python
from swarms import HeavySwarm

# Initialize the HeavySwarm with configuration
swarm = HeavySwarm(
    worker_model_name="gpt-4o-mini",  # Model for worker agents
    question_agent_model_name="gpt-4o-mini",  # Model for question generation
    loops_per_agent=1,  # Number of loops per agent
    show_dashboard=True,  # Enable real-time dashboard
)

# Run complex analysis task
result = swarm.run(
    "Provide 3 publicly traded biotech companies that are currently trading below their cash value. "
    "For each company identified, provide available data or projections for the next 6 months, "
    "including any relevant financial metrics, upcoming catalysts, or events that could impact valuation. "
    "Present your findings in a clear, structured format with ticker symbols, current prices, "
    "cash values, and percentage differences."
)

print(result)
```

The `HeavySwarm` provides:

-   **5-Phase Analysis**: Question generation, research, analysis, alternatives, and verification

-   **Specialized Agents**: Each phase uses purpose-built agents for optimal results

-   **Comprehensive Coverage**: Multiple perspectives and thorough investigation

-   **Real-time Dashboard**: Optional visualization of the analysis process

-   **Structured Output**: Well-organized and actionable results

This architecture is perfect for financial analysis, strategic planning, research reports, and any task requiring deep, multi-faceted analysis. [Learn more about HeavySwarm](https://docs.swarms.world/en/latest/swarms/structs/heavy_swarm/)
