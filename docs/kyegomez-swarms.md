# Swarms: The Enterprise-Grade Multi-Agent Orchestration Framework

**Unlock the power of multi-agent AI with Swarms, a production-ready framework designed for scalable, enterprise-grade deployments.**

[<img src="https://github.com/kyegomez/swarms/blob/master/images/swarmslogobanner.png" alt="Swarms Logo" width="100%">](https://github.com/kyegomez/swarms)

Swarms is a powerful Python library for building and deploying sophisticated multi-agent systems. It offers a comprehensive set of features for orchestrating AI agents, simplifying complex tasks, and integrating seamlessly into existing infrastructure. Check out the [original repo here](https://github.com/kyegomez/swarms).

**Key Features:**

*   **Production-Ready Infrastructure:** Build reliable, scalable multi-agent applications with built-in features for high availability and performance.
*   **Multi-Agent Orchestration:** Design and deploy complex workflows using sequential, concurrent, and graph-based architectures.
*   **Enterprise Integration:** Seamlessly integrate with a wide range of models, tools, and existing systems.
*   **Enterprise Scalability:** Leverage intelligent resource management and horizontal scaling for high-throughput processing.
*   **Developer Experience:** Accelerate development with an intuitive API, comprehensive documentation, and extensive examples.

## Getting Started

### Installation

Install Swarms using pip, uv (recommended), or poetry:

```bash
# Using pip
pip3 install -U swarms
```
```bash
# Using uv (Recommended)
uv pip install swarms
```
```bash
# Using poetry
poetry add swarms
```

For other installation options (from source, Docker), please refer to the original README.

### Environment Configuration

Configure your environment variables:

```
OPENAI_API_KEY=""
WORKSPACE_DIR="agent_workspace"
ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=""
GROQ_API_KEY=""
```

### ü§ñ Your First Agent

Create autonomous agents with LLMs, tools, and memory:

```python
from swarms import Agent

# Initialize a new agent
agent = Agent(
    model_name="gpt-4o-mini",  # Specify the LLM
    max_loops="auto",              # Set the number of interactions
    interactive=True,         # Enable interactive mode for real-time feedback
)

# Run the agent with a task
agent.run("What are the key benefits of using a multi-agent system?")
```

### ü§ù Your First Swarm: Multi-Agent Collaboration

Coordinate multiple agents to work together on complex tasks:

```python
from swarms import Agent, SequentialWorkflow

# Agent 1: The Researcher
researcher = Agent(
    agent_name="Researcher",
    system_prompt="Your job is to research the provided topic and provide a detailed summary.",
    model_name="gpt-4o-mini",
)

# Agent 2: The Writer
writer = Agent(
    agent_name="Writer",
    system_prompt="Your job is to take the research summary and write a beautiful, engaging blog post about it.",
    model_name="gpt-4o-mini",
)

# Create a sequential workflow where the researcher's output feeds into the writer's input
workflow = SequentialWorkflow(agents=[researcher, writer])

# Run the workflow on a task
final_post = workflow.run("The history and future of artificial intelligence")
print(final_post)
```

### ü§ñ AutoSwarmBuilder: Autonomous Agent Generation

Automatically generate specialized agents and their workflows:

```python
from swarms.structs.auto_swarm_builder import AutoSwarmBuilder
import json

# Initialize the AutoSwarmBuilder
swarm = AutoSwarmBuilder(
    name="My Swarm",
    description="A swarm of agents",
    verbose=True,
    max_loops=1,
    return_agents=True,
    model_name="gpt-4o-mini",
)

# Let the builder automatically create agents and workflows
result = swarm.run(
    task="Create an accounting team to analyze crypto transactions, "
         "there must be 5 agents in the team with extremely extensive prompts. "
         "Make the prompts extremely detailed and specific and long and comprehensive. "
         "Make sure to include all the details of the task in the prompts."
)

# The result contains the generated agents and their configurations
print(json.dumps(result, indent=4))
```

## üèóÔ∏è Multi-Agent Architectures For Production Deployments

Swarms provides various pre-built multi-agent architectures, enabling you to orchestrate agents in different ways.

| **Architecture** | **Description** | **Best For** |
|---|---|---|
| **[SequentialWorkflow](https://docs.swarms.world/en/latest/swarms/structs/sequential_workflow/)** | Agents execute tasks in a linear chain; the output of one agent becomes the input for the next. | Step-by-step processes such as data transformation pipelines and report generation. |
| **[ConcurrentWorkflow](https://docs.swarms.world/en/latest/swarms/structs/concurrent_workflow/)** | Agents run tasks simultaneously for maximum efficiency. | High-throughput tasks such as batch processing and parallel data analysis. |
| **[AgentRearrange](https://docs.swarms.world/en/latest/swarms/structs/agent_rearrange/)** | Dynamically maps complex relationships (e.g., `a -> b, c`) between agents. | Flexible and adaptive workflows, task distribution, and dynamic routing. |
| **[GraphWorkflow](https://docs.swarms.world/en/latest/swarms/structs/graph_workflow/)** | Orchestrates agents as nodes in a Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG). | Complex projects with intricate dependencies, such as software builds. |
| **[MixtureOfAgents (MoA)](https://docs.swarms.world/en/latest/swarms/structs/moa/)** | Utilizes multiple expert agents in parallel and synthesizes their outputs. | Complex problem-solving and achieving state-of-the-art performance through collaboration. |
| **[GroupChat](https://docs.swarms.world/en/latest/swarms/structs/group_chat/)** | Agents collaborate and make decisions through a conversational interface. | Real-time collaborative decision-making, negotiations, and brainstorming. |
| **[ForestSwarm](https://docs.swarms.world/en/latest/swarms/structs/forest_swarm/)** | Dynamically selects the most suitable agent or tree of agents for a given task. | Task routing, optimizing for expertise, and complex decision-making trees. |
| **[HierarchicalSwarm](https://docs.swarms.world/en/latest/swarms/structs/hiearchical_swarm/)** | Orchestrates agents with a director who creates plans and distributes tasks to specialized worker agents. | Complex project management, team coordination, and hierarchical decision-making with feedback loops. |
| **[HeavySwarm](https://docs.swarms.world/en/latest/swarms/structs/heavy_swarm/)** | Implements a five-phase workflow with specialized agents (Research, Analysis, Alternatives, Verification) for comprehensive task analysis. | Complex research and analysis tasks, financial analysis, strategic planning, and comprehensive reporting. |
| **[SwarmRouter](https://docs.swarms.world/en/latest/swarms/structs/swarm_router/)** | A universal orchestrator that provides a single interface to run any type of swarm with dynamic selection. | Simplifying complex workflows, switching between swarm strategies, and unified multi-agent management. |
