## Technology Under the Hood

ERPNext is built upon powerful open-source technologies:

*   **Frappe Framework:** A full-stack web application framework (Python & Javascript) providing a robust foundation for web applications, including a database abstraction layer, user authentication, and a REST API.
*   **Frappe UI:** A Vue-based UI library for a modern and user-friendly interface.

## Getting Started

### Managed Hosting

Simplify your ERPNext deployment with [Frappe Cloud](https://frappecloud.com). It offers easy hosting, maintenance, and support.

## Development Setup

### Manual Install

The Easy Way: our install script for bench will install all dependencies (e.g. MariaDB). See https://github.com/frappe/bench for more details.

New passwords will be created for the ERPNext "Administrator" user, the MariaDB root user, and the frappe user (the script displays the passwords and saves them to ~/frappe_passwords.txt).

### Local

To set up the repository locally, follow these steps:

1.  Setup bench by following the [Installation Steps](https://frappeframework.com/docs/user/en/installation) and start the server
    ```
    bench start
    ```

2.  In a separate terminal window, run the following commands:
    ```
    # Create a new site
    bench new-site erpnext.localhost
    ```

3.  Get the ERPNext app and install it
    ```
    # Get the ERPNext app
    bench get-app https://github.com/frappe/erpnext

    # Install the app
    bench --site erpnext.localhost install-app erpnext
    ```

4.  Open the URL `http://erpnext.localhost:8000/app` in your browser, you should see the app running
