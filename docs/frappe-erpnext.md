## Production Setup

The easiest way to get started is with [Frappe Cloud](https://frappecloud.com), a simple and sophisticated platform for hosting Frappe applications. It handles installation, updates, monitoring, and support, letting you focus on your business.

### Self-Hosted

#### Docker

**Prerequisites:** docker, docker-compose, git. Refer [Docker Documentation](https://docs.docker.com) for more details on Docker setup.

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/frappe/frappe_docker
    cd frappe_docker
    ```

2.  **Run Docker Compose:**
    ```bash
    docker compose -f pwd.yml up -d
    ```

After a few minutes, access your site on `http://localhost:8080`.

**Default Login:**
*   Username: `Administrator`
*   Password: `admin`

See [Frappe Docker](https://github.com/frappe/frappe_docker?tab=readme-ov-file#to-run-on-arm64-architecture-follow-this-instructions) for ARM based docker setup.

## Development Setup

### Manual Install

*The Easy Way:* Use the install script for bench, which will install all dependencies (e.g., MariaDB).  See [bench](https://github.com/frappe/bench) for details.

**Important:** New passwords will be created for the "Administrator" user, the MariaDB root user, and the frappe user. The script displays these passwords and saves them to `~/frappe_passwords.txt`.

### Local Setup

1.  **Setup bench:** Follow the [Installation Steps](https://frappeframework.com/docs/user/en/installation) and start the server:
    ```bash
    bench start
    ```

2.  **Open a new terminal:**
    ```bash
    bench new-site erpnext.localhost
    bench get-app https://github.com/frappe/erpnext
    bench --site erpnext.localhost install-app erpnext
    ```

3.  **Access ERPNext:** Open `http://erpnext.localhost:8000/app` in your browser.
