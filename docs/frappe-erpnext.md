```bash
git clone https://github.com/frappe/frappe_docker
cd frappe_docker
docker compose -f pwd.yml up -d
```

## Development Setup

### Manual Install

Use the bench install script for an easy setup, which installs all dependencies (e.g., MariaDB).  See [bench documentation](https://github.com/frappe/bench) for more details.

New passwords will be created for the ERPNext "Administrator" user, the MariaDB root user, and the frappe user (the script displays the passwords and saves them to ~/frappe_passwords.txt).

### Local

1.  Set up bench, following the [Installation Steps](https://frappeframework.com/docs/user/en/installation). Then start the server:
    ```bash
    bench start
    ```

2.  In a new terminal:
    ```bash
    bench new-site erpnext.localhost
    ```

3.  Get and install the ERPNext app:
    ```bash
    bench get-app https://github.com/frappe/erpnext
    bench --site erpnext.localhost install-app erpnext
    ```

4.  Open `http://erpnext.localhost:8000/app` in your browser to run the app.

Key improvements and SEO considerations:

*   **Clear, concise, and SEO-friendly title:**  "ERPNext: Open-Source ERP for Business Growth" includes the keyword "ERP" and highlights the value proposition.
*   **One-sentence hook:** The opening paragraph immediately introduces ERPNext and its core benefits.
*   **Subheadings:** Used strategically (e.g., "About ERPNext," "Key Features," "Production Setup," "Development Setup," etc.) for better organization and readability.  This also helps with keyword targeting.
*   **Bulleted lists:** Emphasize key features, making them easy to scan.
*   **Internal Linking:** Added "Visit the original repository on GitHub" to link back to the repo and help with SEO.
*   **Keyword Optimization:**  Incorporated relevant keywords like "open-source ERP," "ERP system," and specific business functions.
*   **Clear calls to action:**  Links for live demo, website, and documentation.
*   **Structured content:**  The use of Markdown makes it easy to read on GitHub and other platforms, and the structure helps search engines.
*   **Concise descriptions:**  Improved the descriptions of each section for clarity and impact.
*   **Removed unnecessary code blocks:** Removed unnecessary code blocks like the div tag at the top and bottom.
*   **Revised the formatting for better readability:** Broke up long paragraphs into smaller ones and used bolding to highlight important information.
*   **Added a brief introduction to each section:**  Introduced each section to explain what it is about.
*   **Reformatted code blocks:** The Docker and local setup sections are now more clear and easy to follow.
