## Why Choose ERPNext?

ERPNext offers a cost-effective and flexible solution for businesses of all sizes. It eliminates the need for separate software for different business functions, providing a unified platform to manage your entire operation. Being open-source, it offers transparency, customization, and community support.

## Under the Hood: Technologies

ERPNext is built upon powerful open-source technologies:

*   [**Frappe Framework**](https://github.com/frappe/frappe): A full-stack web application framework (Python & Javascript) providing the core infrastructure.
*   [**Frappe UI**](https://github.com/frappe/frappe-ui): A modern Vue-based UI library for a responsive and user-friendly interface.

## Development Setup

### Manual Install

**The Easy Way:** Use the install script for bench (requires prerequisites):
    ```bash
    # See https://github.com/frappe/bench for more details
    ```
    New passwords will be created for the ERPNext "Administrator" user, the MariaDB root user, and the frappe user (the script displays the passwords and saves them to ~/frappe_passwords.txt).

### Local

Follow these steps to set up the repository locally:

1.  **Set up bench:** Follow the [Installation Steps](https://frappeframework.com/docs/user/en/installation) and start the server:

    ```bash
    bench start
    ```

2.  **Create a new site:**

    ```bash
    bench new-site erpnext.localhost
    ```

3.  **Get and install ERPNext app:**

    ```bash
    bench get-app https://github.com/frappe/erpnext
    bench --site erpnext.localhost install-app erpnext
    ```

4.  **Access the app:** Open `http://erpnext.localhost:8000/app` in your browser.
