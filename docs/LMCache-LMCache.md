## LMCache: Accelerate LLM Serving with Efficient KV Cache Management

LMCache significantly reduces latency and boosts throughput for Large Language Models by efficiently caching and reusing KV (key-value) caches. Find out more on [GitHub](https://github.com/LMCache/LMCache).

### Key Features

*   **Enhanced Performance:** Drastically reduce Time-to-First-Token (TTFT) and increase throughput, especially in long-context scenarios.
*   **KV Cache Reusability:** Reuses KV caches for any reused text, regardless of its position within the input.
*   **Flexible Storage:** Supports caching across various storage locations: GPU, CPU DRAM, and Local Disk.
*   **vLLM Integration:** Seamlessly integrates with vLLM for high-performance CPU KV cache offloading, disaggregated prefill, and P2P KV cache sharing.
*   **Production-Ready:** Supported in the vLLM production stack, llm-d, and KServe.
*   **Stable Support:** Reliable support for non-prefix KV caches.
*   **Multiple Storage Backends:** Offers diverse storage options including CPU, Disk, and [NIXL](https://github.com/ai-dynamo/nixl).

### Installation

Install LMCache easily using pip:

```bash
pip install lmcache
```

For detailed installation instructions, especially for integrating with specific serving engines or resolving potential dependency conflicts, see the [detailed installation instructions](https://docs.lmcache.ai/getting_started/installation) in the documentation.
