## LMCache: Accelerate LLM Serving with Efficient KV Cache Management

LMCache dramatically improves LLM serving performance by intelligently caching and reusing KV caches across your infrastructure. [Learn more at the original repository.](https://github.com/LMCache/LMCache)

**Key Features:**

*   ‚ö° **Reduced TTFT & Increased Throughput:** Significantly lowers Time-To-First-Token and boosts overall LLM serving throughput, especially for long-context applications.
*   üîÑ **KV Cache Reusability:**  Stores and reuses KV caches of *any* reused text (not just prefixes) across different serving instances, optimizing GPU resource usage.
*   ‚öôÔ∏è **vLLM Integration:** Seamlessly integrates with vLLM (v1+) to enable high-performance CPU KVCache offloading, disaggregated prefill, and P2P KVCache sharing.
*   üîó **Production-Ready:**  Officially supported in vLLM Production Stack, llm-d, and KServe.
*   üíæ **Flexible Storage Options:** Supports CPU, Disk, and [NIXL](https://github.com/ai-dynamo/nixl) storage backends for KV caches.
*   ‚úÖ **Non-Prefix Cache Support:**  Stable support for non-prefix KV caches.

## Installation

Install LMCache with pip:

```bash
pip install lmcache
```

For detailed instructions, especially regarding specific serving engines or version compatibility, see the [installation guide](https://docs.lmcache.ai/getting_started/installation) in the documentation.
