## LMCache: Accelerate LLM Serving with Efficient KV Cache Reuse

LMCache dramatically boosts the performance of Large Language Models by intelligently reusing KV caches.  [Learn more at the LMCache GitHub repository](https://github.com/LMCache/LMCache).

### Key Features

*   **Reduced Latency:** Significantly decrease Time-To-First-Token (TTFT) for faster response times.
*   **Increased Throughput:** Maximize the number of requests your LLM can handle.
*   **KV Cache Reuse:** Efficiently reuses KV caches across various locations (GPU, CPU, Disk) for any reused text, not just prefixes.
*   **vLLM Integration:** Seamlessly integrates with vLLM v1 for high-performance CPU KVCache offloading, disaggregated prefill, and P2P KVCache sharing.
*   **Flexible Storage:** Supports CPU, Disk, and [NIXL](https://github.com/ai-dynamo/nixl) for versatile storage options.
*   **Production-Ready:** Officially supported in the [vLLM Production Stack](https://github.com/vllm-project/production-stack/), [llm-d](https://github.com/llm-d/llm-d/), and [KServe](https://github.com/kserve/kserve).
*   **Non-Prefix KV Cache Support:** Stable support for caching and reusing non-prefix KV caches.

### Installation

Install LMCache easily using pip:

```bash
pip install lmcache
```

Refer to the [documentation](https://docs.lmcache.ai/getting_started/installation) for detailed instructions, particularly if you're using a specific vLLM version or a different serving engine.

### Getting Started
