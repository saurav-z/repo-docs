# MAVLink: The Lightweight Communication Protocol for Drones and Robotics

MAVLink (Micro Air Vehicle Message Marshalling Library) is a powerful and lightweight message library designed for seamless communication between drones, ground control stations, and other robotic systems.  This open-source protocol uses a header-only design and XML-based message definitions.

## Key Features of MAVLink

*   **Lightweight and Efficient:** Optimized for resource-constrained systems, making it ideal for drones and embedded devices.
*   **Header-Only Library:** Easy to integrate into your projects without complex linking.
*   **XML-Based Message Definitions:** Simplifies message creation and management using XML files for different systems ("dialects").
*   **Cross-Platform Support:**  Provides code generation tools for various programming languages, including C, C++, Python, and more.
*   **Field-Proven:** Widely adopted and used in numerous products for reliable interoperability between components from different manufacturers.
*   **Bandwidth Optimization:** Designed for efficient communication even with limited bandwidth.

## Getting Started: Generating C Headers

Here's a quick guide to generate C headers for MAVLink.  Detailed instructions can be found on the [MAVLink website](https://mavlink.io/en/).

1.  **Install Dependencies (Ubuntu LTS 20.04/22.04):**

    ```bash
    sudo apt install python3-pip
    ```

2.  **Clone the MAVLink Repository:**

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/mavlink/mavlink.git --recursive
    cd mavlink
    ```

3.  **Install Python Requirements:**

    ```bash
    python3 -m pip install -r pymavlink/requirements.txt
    ```

4.  **Generate C Headers (Example):**

    ```bash
    python3 -m pymavlink.tools.mavgen --lang=C --wire-protocol=2.0 --output=generated/include/mavlink/v2.0 message_definitions/v1.0/common.xml
    ```

## Using MAVLink with CMake

1.  **Install Headers Locally:**

    ```bash
    cmake -Bbuild -H. -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=install -DMAVLINK_DIALECT=common -DMAVLINK_VERSION=2.0
    cmake --build build --target install
    ```

2.  **Use `find_package` in your `CMakeLists.txt`:**

    ```cmake
    find_package(MAVLink REQUIRED)
    add_executable(my_program my_program.c)
    target_link_libraries(my_program PRIVATE MAVLink::mavlink)
    ```

3.  **Configure CMake with the Install Directory:**

    ```bash
    cd ../my_program
    cmake -Bbuild -H. -DCMAKE_PREFIX_PATH=../mavlink/install
    ```

    For a full example, see [examples/c](examples/c).

    *Note: MAVLink is a header-only library, so `target_link_libraries` does not perform actual linking.*
