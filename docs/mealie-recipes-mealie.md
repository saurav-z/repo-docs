## About Mealie

Mealie is a powerful, open-source, and self-hosted application designed to help you manage your recipes, plan your meals, and generate shopping lists. Built with a REST API backend and a reactive Vue.js frontend, Mealie offers a clean and intuitive user experience for the whole family.  Easily import recipes by providing the URL and Mealie will automatically import the relevant data, or add a family recipe with the UI editor. Mealie also provides an API for interactions from 3rd party applications.
