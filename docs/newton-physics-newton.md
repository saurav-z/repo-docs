**⚠️ Important: Prerelease Software ⚠️**

This project is currently in active alpha development.  The API is subject to change, and breaking changes may occur frequently.

## Key Features of Newton

*   **GPU-Accelerated Physics:** Leverages the power of NVIDIA Warp for lightning-fast simulation.
*   **Differentiable Physics:** Enables gradient-based optimization and control for advanced robotics applications.
*   **Extensible Design:**  Supports user-defined customizations and extensions for tailored simulations.
*   **Integration with MuJoCo Warp:** Utilizes [MuJoCo Warp](https://github.com/google-deepmind/mujoco_warp) as a primary backend.
*   **Targeted Audience:** Specifically designed for roboticists and simulation researchers.
*   **Rapid Iteration and Scalability:** Facilitates faster development cycles and the ability to handle complex simulations.
