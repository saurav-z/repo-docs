**Newton, a GPU-accelerated physics simulation engine, empowers researchers and roboticists to build and test complex simulations with unprecedented speed and efficiency.**

**⚠️ Prerelease Software: Alpha Development ⚠️**

Please note that Newton is currently in alpha development. The API is subject to change, and breaking changes may occur.

## Key Features

*   **GPU Acceleration:** Leveraging the power of NVIDIA GPUs for significantly faster physics simulation.
*   **Differentiable Physics:** Enables gradient-based optimization and control for advanced robotics research.
*   **Extensible Design:** Built with user-defined customization in mind, allowing for tailored simulations.
*   **MuJoCo Warp Integration:** Uses [MuJoCo Warp](https://github.com/google-deepmind/mujoco_warp) as a primary backend, providing robust and established physics models.
*   **Based on NVIDIA Warp:** Extends and generalizes the `warp.sim` module for advanced simulation capabilities.
