### Learn More

#### Rapid AI Prototyping

Kiln simplifies AI development by enabling you to try and compare various approaches quickly and easily. Kiln supports features like:
- Prompting techniques: basic, few-shot, multi-shot, repair & feedback
- Chain of thought / thinking, with optional custom ‚Äúthinking‚Äù instructions
- Many models: GPT, Llama, Claude, Gemini, Mistral, Gemma, Phi
- Fine Tuning: create custom models using your Kiln dataset

#### Collaborate Across Technical and Non-Technical Teams

Kiln bridges the gap between subject matter experts and technical teams. Subject matter experts can generate structured datasets and ratings without coding. Data scientists can consume the datasets created by subject matter experts via the UI or our python library. QA and PM can help generate the dataset content needed to fix the issue at the model layer.

#### Build High-Quality AI Products

Kiln helps you create the datasets you need for your product. Every interaction in Kiln contributes to a growing dataset of inputs, outputs, ratings, feedback, and repairs that improve your models over time. Iterating on your dataset allows you to address issues that arise.
