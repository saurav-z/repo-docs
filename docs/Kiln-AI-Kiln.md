## Install Python Library

[![PyPI - Version](https://img.shields.io/pypi/v/kiln-ai.svg?logo=pypi&label=PyPI&logoColor=gold)](https://pypi.org/project/kiln-ai/) [![Docs](https://img.shields.io/badge/docs-pdoc-blue)](https://kiln-ai.github.io/Kiln/kiln_core_docs/index.html)

Integrate Kiln datasets seamlessly into your workflows, build fine-tuned models, utilize Kiln in notebooks, and build custom tools with our open-source [python library](https://pypi.org/project/kiln-ai/). [Read the docs](https://kiln-ai.github.io/Kiln/kiln_core_docs/index.html) for practical examples.

```bash
pip install kiln-ai
```

## Learn More

### Rapid Prototyping

Kiln simplifies trying multiple AI approaches and comparing them quickly, which often boosts quality and performance.

Current capabilities include:

*   Various prompting techniques: basic, few-shot, multi-shot, repair & feedback
*   Chain of thought / thinking, with optional custom ‚Äúthinking‚Äù instructions
*   Support for GPT, Llama, Claude, Gemini, Mistral, Gemma, and Phi models
*   Fine Tuning: create custom models using your Kiln dataset

Future enhancements include options for evals, and RAG. You can build these techniques today using Kiln datasets and our python library.

### Collaborate Across Technical and Non-Technical Teams

Kiln acts as a vital collaboration tool bridging the gap between subject matter experts and technical teams.

Subject matter experts can generate structured datasets without coding via intuitive apps.

Data scientists can use the UI, or dive deep using the python library.

QA and PM can quickly identify issues and contribute dataset content to improve models.

Dataset files use Git for powerful collaboration and attribution.  Shared drives can be used for non-technical team members to easily contribute data.

### Build High Quality AI Products with Datasets

Kiln helps you create datasets for your products, and your model quality improves automatically as the dataset grows.

Iterate the dataset to address shifts in product goals, or new bugs.
