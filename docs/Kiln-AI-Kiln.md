### Rapid Prototyping

Kiln empowers you to experiment and compare various AI approaches effortlessly, speeding up your development cycle.

We currently support:

*   Various prompting techniques: basic, few-shot, multi-shot, repair & feedback
*   Chain of thought / thinking, with optional custom ‚Äúthinking‚Äù instructions
*   Many models: GPT, Llama, Claude, Gemini, Mistral, Gemma, Phi
*   Fine Tuning: create custom models using your Kiln dataset

In the future, we plan to add more powerful no-code options like evals, and RAG. For experienced data-scientists, you can create these techniques today using Kiln datasets and our python library.

### Collaborate Across Technical and Non-Technical Teams

Kiln bridges the gap between subject matter experts and technical teams, facilitating seamless collaboration.

Subject matter experts can use our intuitive desktop apps to generate structured datasets and ratings, without coding or using technical tools.

Data-scientists can leverage the UI, or deep dive with our python library.

QA and PM can easily identify issues sooner and help generate the dataset content needed to fix the issue at the model layer.

The dataset file format is designed to be be used with Git for powerful collaboration and attribution. Many people can contribute in parallel; collisions are avoided using UUIDs, and attribution is captured inside the dataset files. You can even share a dataset on a shared drive, letting completely non-technical team members contribute data and evals without knowing Git.

### Build High Quality AI Products with Datasets

Create high-quality AI models by building datasets within Kiln. Every interaction captures inputs, outputs, human ratings, feedback, and repairs to improve model quality.

Your model quality improves automatically as the dataset grows, by giving the models more examples of quality content (and mistakes).

If your product goals shift or new bugs are found (as is almost always the case), you can easily iterate the dataset to address issues.
