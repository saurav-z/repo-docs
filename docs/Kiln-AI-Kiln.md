### Rapid Prototyping

Kiln simplifies the process of testing various AI approaches by offering quick model comparison with a user-friendly interface, resulting in improved quality and performance.

We currently support:

* Various prompting techniques: basic, few-shot, multi-shot, repair & feedback
* Chain of thought / thinking, with optional custom ‚Äúthinking‚Äù instructions
* Many models: GPT, Llama, Claude, Gemini, Mistral, Gemma, Phi
* Fine Tuning: create custom models using your Kiln dataset

In the future, we plan to add more powerful no-code options like evals, and RAG. For experienced data-scientists, you can create these techniques today using Kiln datasets and our python library.

### Collaborate Across Technical and Non-Technical Teams

Kiln bridges the gap between subject matter experts and technical teams, enabling seamless collaboration in AI product development.

Subject matter experts can use our intuitive desktop apps to generate structured datasets and ratings, without coding or using technical tools. No command line or GPU required.

Data-scientists can consume the dataset created by subject matter experts, using the UI, or deep dive with our python library.

QA and PM can easily identify issues sooner and help generate the dataset content needed to fix the issue at the model layer.

The dataset file format is designed to be be used with Git for powerful collaboration and attribution. Many people can contribute in parallel; collisions are avoided using UUIDs, and attribution is captured inside the dataset files. You can even share a dataset on a shared drive, letting completely non-technical team members contribute data and evals without knowing Git.

### Build High Quality AI Products with Datasets

Kiln helps you create a structured dataset from your product interactions, giving models more examples of quality content and mistakes.

Your model quality improves automatically as the dataset grows.

If your product goals shift or new bugs are found (as is almost always the case), you can easily iterate the dataset to address issues.
