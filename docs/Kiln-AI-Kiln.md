### Learn More About Kiln

#### Rapid AI Prototyping

Kiln facilitates rapid experimentation and comparison of different AI approaches, leading to higher-quality and improved performance.  It supports various prompting techniques, including Chain of Thought, and provides support for many models. Future plans include expanding no-code options such as evals and RAG.

#### Collaboration Across Teams

Kiln bridges the gap between technical and non-technical teams.  Subject matter experts can use intuitive desktop apps to generate structured datasets and ratings.  Data scientists can utilize the UI or our Python library.  QA and PM teams can use this collaboration to identify issues and generate dataset content to address them at the model layer.

#### Building High-Quality AI Products with Datasets

Kiln helps you build datasets for your AI products, capturing inputs, outputs, human ratings, feedback, and necessary repairs to train high-quality models. The quality of your model improves as the dataset grows, providing it with more high-quality examples. Iterating the dataset to address issues is simple.
