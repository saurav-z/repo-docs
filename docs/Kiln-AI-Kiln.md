### Rapid Prototyping

Kiln accelerates your prototyping process, enabling you to experiment with diverse models and techniques quickly and easily. This allows for informed comparisons and improved performance.

Supported features include:

*   Versatile prompting techniques: basic, few-shot, multi-shot, and repair & feedback
*   Chain of thought / thinking, customizable "thinking" instructions
*   Extensive model compatibility: GPT, Llama, Claude, Gemini, Mistral, Gemma, and Phi
*   Fine-tuning capabilities to create custom models using your Kiln datasets

Future enhancements include powerful no-code options like evals and RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation).  Data scientists can achieve these techniques today using Kiln datasets and the Python library.

### Foster Collaboration Across Technical and Non-Technical Teams

Kiln streamlines the collaboration between subject matter experts and technical teams in the AI product development process.

Subject matter experts can generate structured datasets and ratings using the user-friendly desktop app, without requiring coding expertise or specialized tools.

Data scientists can easily leverage these datasets through the UI, or dive deeper using the python library.

QA and PM can identify issues sooner and contribute to dataset content, which improves model accuracy.

The dataset file format seamlessly integrates with Git for effective collaboration.  Parallel contributions are supported, and collisions are minimized. You can even share datasets on a shared drive, allowing even non-technical team members to contribute data and evaluations without Git knowledge.

### Build High-Quality AI Products with Datasets

Kiln lets you create and leverage "datasets," which is fundamental to any AI product. Kiln captures the inputs, outputs, ratings, and feedback, which is invaluable for quality model-building. The more you use Kiln, the better the model becomes.

Iterate your dataset easily to resolve product goals and/or bugs.
