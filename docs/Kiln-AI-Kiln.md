## Learn More About Kiln

### Rapid Prototyping

Kiln streamlines the AI model development process, allowing you to experiment with different methods quickly. This rapid prototyping approach leads to improved performance and higher-quality models by enabling you to try new techniques in a few clicks.

Kiln currently supports:

*   Various prompting techniques: basic, few-shot, multi-shot, repair & feedback
*   Chain of thought / thinking, with optional custom ‚Äúthinking‚Äù instructions
*   Many models: GPT, Llama, Claude, Gemini, Mistral, Gemma, Phi
*   Fine Tuning: create custom models using your Kiln dataset

### Team Collaboration

Kiln serves as a bridge between technical and non-technical teams, fostering effective collaboration during AI product development.

Subject matter experts can use the intuitive desktop apps to create structured datasets and ratings without the need for coding skills.

Data scientists can easily utilize the datasets created through the UI, or dive deeper using our Python library.

QA and PM teams can swiftly identify issues and contribute to dataset creation, which helps resolve model-level problems more quickly.

The dataset file format supports Git for collaborative version control and attribution, allowing multiple team members to contribute in parallel without creating conflicts.

### Build High-Quality AI Products with Datasets

Kiln simplifies the creation of high-quality models through curated datasets. Every use of Kiln captures essential data such as inputs, outputs, human ratings, feedback, and corrections, which contributes to building and refining your models. As the dataset grows, the quality of your models automatically improves by providing more examples of quality and addressing mistakes.

In the event of product shifts or emerging bugs, the dataset can be easily iterated upon to address issues.
