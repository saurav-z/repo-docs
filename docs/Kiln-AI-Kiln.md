For developers, see our [Kiln Python Library Docs](https://kiln-ai.github.io/Kiln/kiln_core_docs/kiln_ai.html) which include how to load datasets into Kiln, or using Kiln datasets in your own code-base/notebooks.

## Install Python Library

[![PyPI - Version](https://img.shields.io/pypi/v/kiln-ai.svg?logo=pypi&label=PyPI&logoColor=gold)](https://pypi.org/project/kiln-ai/) [![Docs](https://img.shields.io/badge/docs-pdoc-blue)](https://kiln-ai.github.io/Kiln/kiln_core_docs/index.html)

Integrate Kiln datasets seamlessly into your workflows, build fine-tunes, and utilize Kiln in notebooks with our open-source [python library](https://pypi.org/project/kiln-ai/). [Explore the documentation](https://kiln-ai.github.io/Kiln/kiln_core_docs/index.html) for detailed examples.

```bash
pip install kiln-ai
```

### Streamlined Prototyping

With Kiln, effortlessly experiment with diverse approaches and evaluate them within clicks, without getting bogged down in code. This leads to better performance and quality in your model.

We presently offer support for:

-   A variety of prompting techniques: basic, few-shot, multi-shot, repair & feedback.
-   Chain of thought / thinking with custom ‚Äúthinking‚Äù instructions.
-   Many models: GPT, Llama, Claude, Gemini, Mistral, Gemma, Phi
-   Fine Tuning: creating custom models using your Kiln dataset

We intend to implement no-code options like evals and RAG in the future. If you are experienced in data-science, feel free to apply these techniques using Kiln datasets and our python library.

### Facilitate Collaboration Across Technical and Non-Technical Teams

Kiln helps bridge the gap between subject matter experts and technical teams when building AI products. It provides a platform for non-technical users to generate structured datasets without complex tools or coding knowledge.

With our user-friendly desktop apps, subject matter experts can generate structured datasets and ratings without coding or technical skills.

Data-scientists can work with datasets created by experts using the UI, or deep dive into data with our Python library.

QA and PM teams can identify issues earlier and create the necessary dataset content to fix the model layer.

The dataset file format integrates with Git for enhanced collaboration and attribution. The file format allows parallel contributions, avoiding collisions with UUIDs and capturing attribution. You can even share the dataset on a shared drive, allowing any non-technical team member to contribute data and evals without knowing Git.

### Build High Quality AI Products with Datasets

Create and refine datasets for your product using Kiln. Each time you use Kiln, we capture the inputs, outputs, human ratings, feedback, and repairs required to build top-quality models for your product. The more you use Kiln, the more data you have.

As your dataset expands, the model quality naturally improves by giving your models quality examples (and mistakes).

You can easily iterate the dataset if product goals or new issues arise, as often happens.
