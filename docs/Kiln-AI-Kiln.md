### Rapid Prototyping

Kiln simplifies the process of experimenting with new models and techniques. Try various approaches quickly, compare results with ease, and boost quality and performance without extensive coding.

Current support includes:

-   Diverse prompting techniques: basic, few-shot, multi-shot, repair & feedback
-   Chain of thought / thinking, with optional custom ‚Äúthinking‚Äù instructions
-   Wide model compatibility: GPT, Llama, Claude, Gemini, Mistral, Gemma, Phi
-   Fine Tuning: Customize models using your Kiln dataset

Future plans include even more powerful no-code options like evals and RAG. Data scientists can leverage Kiln datasets and our Python library to utilize these techniques now.

### Collaborate Across Technical and Non-Technical Teams

Kiln fosters collaboration between subject matter experts and technical teams. It's designed to bridge the gap between domain knowledge and model building.

Subject matter experts can create structured datasets and ratings effortlessly using our intuitive desktop apps. No coding or technical tools required.

Data scientists can utilize the datasets created by experts through the UI or our Python library.

QA and PM teams can identify and address issues efficiently, contributing to the necessary dataset content to improve model performance.

The dataset file format supports Git for enhanced collaboration and attribution. Concurrent contributions are managed with UUIDs, and all contributions are captured within the dataset files. Datasets can be shared on a shared drive, enabling non-technical team members to contribute data and evaluations.

### Build High Quality AI Products with Datasets

Kiln allows you to generate datasets for use in your products. As you use Kiln, inputs, outputs, human ratings, feedback, and repairs are captured to help build models. More use leads to richer data.

Your model improves as the dataset grows, giving models more quality examples and examples of mistakes.

If your product goals shift or new bugs are found, you can iterate on the dataset to address the issues.
