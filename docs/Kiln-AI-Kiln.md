## Install Python Library

[![PyPI - Version](https://img.shields.io/pypi/v/kiln-ai.svg?logo=pypi&label=PyPI&logoColor=gold)](https://pypi.org/project/kiln-ai/) [![Docs](https://img.shields.io/badge/docs-pdoc-blue)](https://kiln-ai.github.io/Kiln/kiln_core_docs/index.html)

Our open-source [python library](https://pypi.org/project/kiln-ai/) allows you to integrate Kiln datasets into your own workflows, build fine tunes, use Kiln in Notebooks, build custom tools, and much more! [Read the docs](https://kiln-ai.github.io/Kiln/kiln_core_docs/index.html) for examples.

```bash
pip install kiln-ai
```

### Rapid AI Prototyping

Kiln simplifies the process of experimenting with new AI models and techniques, allowing you to compare different approaches quickly and efficiently, and build better AI applications with better outcomes.

Key functionalities:

*   Basic, few-shot, multi-shot, repair & feedback prompting techniques
*   Chain of thought / thinking, with optional custom ‚Äúthinking‚Äù instructions
*   Support for models: GPT, Llama, Claude, Gemini, Mistral, Gemma, Phi
*   Fine Tuning: create custom models using your Kiln dataset

Future additions: evals, and RAG. For data-scientists, you can create these techniques today using Kiln datasets and our python library.

### Collaborate Across Technical and Non-Technical Teams

Kiln acts as a bridge between subject matter experts, who understand the problem you are trying to solve, and the technical teams responsible for building the model.

Subject matter experts can generate structured datasets and ratings using our intuitive desktop apps without any coding.

Data scientists can use the UI, or dive deep into the data with the python library.

QA and PM teams can leverage Kiln to identify and fix model issues.

The dataset file format is designed to be Git-friendly for efficient collaboration and attribution.  Multiple people can work on the same dataset in parallel; collisions are avoided using UUIDs, and attribution is tracked.

### Build High Quality AI Products with Datasets

Kiln allows you to create and refine a "dataset" for your AI projects, improving your model quality and performance over time by providing it with examples of quality content and identifying and resolving mistakes.

Model quality improves automatically as the dataset grows, by giving the models more examples of quality content (and mistakes).

Iterate the dataset to address shifts in product goals and/or new bugs as needed.
