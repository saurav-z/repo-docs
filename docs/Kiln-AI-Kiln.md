For developers, explore the [Kiln Python Library Docs](https://kiln-ai.github.io/Kiln/kiln_core_docs/kiln_ai.html) to learn how to load datasets and integrate Kiln into your projects.

## Python Library Installation

[![PyPI - Version](https://img.shields.io/pypi/v/kiln-ai.svg?logo=pypi&label=PyPI&logoColor=gold)](https://pypi.org/project/kiln-ai/) [![Docs](https://img.shields.io/badge/docs-pdoc-blue)](https://kiln-ai.github.io/Kiln/kiln_core_docs/index.html)

Integrate Kiln datasets seamlessly into your workflows using our open-source [Python library](https://pypi.org/project/kiln-ai/). Build fine-tunes, utilize Kiln within notebooks, and develop custom tools.  [Read the docs](https://kiln-ai.github.io/Kiln/kiln_core_docs/index.html) for usage examples.

```bash
pip install kiln-ai
```

## Deep Dive: Rapid Prototyping & Collaboration

Kiln streamlines AI development by allowing you to quickly experiment with various models and techniques without extensive coding. You can rapidly compare different approaches to achieve higher quality and improved performance.

*   **Flexible Prompting:** Supports diverse prompting strategies, including basic, few-shot, multi-shot, and feedback-driven approaches.
*   **Advanced Techniques:** Includes built-in support for chain-of-thought reasoning with customizable "thinking" instructions.
*   **Extensive Model Compatibility:** Works with leading models like GPT, Llama, Claude, Gemini, Mistral, Gemma, and Phi, along with any model accessible via Ollama, OpenAI, OpenRouter, Fireworks, Groq, or AWS.
*   **Future-Proof:** Planned features include powerful no-code options for evals and RAG. Advanced users can leverage Kiln datasets and our Python library today for these techniques.

Kiln also bridges the gap between technical and non-technical teams, transforming how AI products are built through efficient collaboration.

*   **Collaboration:** Subject matter experts (SMEs) can use our desktop apps to create structured datasets and ratings without requiring code or specialized tools.
*   **Accessibility:** Data scientists can then easily access and utilize those datasets through the UI or our Python library.
*   **Iterative Improvements:** QA and PM teams can identify and address issues, contributing to the dataset to improve model performance, accelerating the model development cycle.

Kiln utilizes a dataset file format designed for seamless Git integration, promoting robust collaboration and attribution.
