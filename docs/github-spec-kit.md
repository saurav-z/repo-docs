## üöÄ Key Features of Spec Kit

*   **Spec-Driven Development:** Transform specifications into executable code, drastically reducing development time.
*   **AI-Powered Automation:** Leverage AI agents for specification creation, planning, and iterative refinement.
*   **Technology Agnostic:** Build applications using diverse technology stacks, programming languages, and frameworks.
*   **Iterative Development:** Support for "Greenfield," "Creative Exploration," and "Brownfield" development phases.
*   **Enterprise-Ready:** Designed to incorporate organizational constraints and compliance requirements.

## ü§î What is Spec-Driven Development?

Spec-Driven Development **redefines software creation** by prioritizing clear, executable specifications. Unlike traditional methods, Spec Kit uses specifications as the foundation, allowing you to focus on the "what" and let the AI agents handle the "how," resulting in faster development cycles and higher-quality software.

## ‚ö° Get Started

1.  **Install Spec Kit:**
    Initialize your project using `uvx` for package management (if needed):

    ```bash
    uvx --from git+https://github.com/github/spec-kit.git specify init <PROJECT_NAME>
    ```

2.  **Describe Your Vision:**
    Use the `/specify` command to define your project's requirements. Focus on the desired functionality.

    ```bash
    /specify Build an application that can help me organize my photos in separate photo albums. Albums are grouped by date and can be re-organized by dragging and dropping on the main page. Albums are never in other nested albums. Within each album, photos are previewed in a tile-like interface.
    ```

3.  **Plan Your Implementation:**
    Use the `/plan` command to outline your chosen tech stack and architectural choices.

    ```bash
    /plan The application uses Vite with minimal number of libraries. Use vanilla HTML, CSS, and JavaScript as much as possible. Images are not uploaded anywhere and metadata is stored in a local SQLite database.
    ```

4.  **Break Down and Implement:**
    Use `/tasks` to generate a task list, then prompt your AI agent to implement the features.

    For a detailed walkthrough, see the [Comprehensive Guide](#detailed-process).

## üìö Core Philosophy

Spec-Driven Development prioritizes:

*   **Intent-driven development:** Focus on "what" before "how."
*   **Rich specification creation:** Employing guardrails and organizational principles.
*   **Multi-step refinement:** Iterative approach over single-shot code generation.
*   **AI Model Capabilities:** Leverage the power of advanced AI models for interpretation.

## üåü Development Phases

| Phase                     | Focus                     | Key Activities                                                                          |
| :------------------------ | :------------------------ | :-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **0-to-1 Development**    | Generate from scratch     | Start with requirements, generate specifications, plan implementation, build applications. |
| **Creative Exploration**  | Parallel implementations | Explore diverse solutions, support multiple stacks, experiment with UX patterns.            |
| **Iterative Enhancement** | Brownfield modernization | Add features iteratively, modernize legacy systems, and adapt processes.                   |

## üéØ Experimental Goals

*   **Technology Independence:** Create apps using various tech stacks.
*   **Enterprise Constraints:** Develop mission-critical apps with organizational constraints.
*   **User-Centric Development:** Build apps for diverse users and development approaches.
*   **Creative & Iterative Processes:** Explore parallel implementation and feature enhancements.

## üîß Prerequisites
