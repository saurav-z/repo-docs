## üöÄ Key Features of Spec Kit

*   ‚úÖ **Intent-Driven Development:** Define *what* you want to build first, allowing the system to figure out the *how*.
*   ‚úÖ **Executable Specifications:** Turn specifications into direct, working implementations.
*   ‚úÖ **AI-Powered Automation:** Leverage the power of AI coding agents for faster development.
*   ‚úÖ **Multi-Step Refinement:** Iterate and refine specifications for optimal results.
*   ‚úÖ **Tech-Stack Agnostic:** Build applications using diverse technologies and frameworks.
*   ‚úÖ **Flexible Development Phases:** Supports Greenfield, Creative Exploration, and Brownfield projects.

## ‚ö°Ô∏è Get Started with Spec-Driven Development

Spec Kit simplifies software development by focusing on specifications, enabling your AI coding agent to do the heavy lifting of implementation.

1.  **Install Specify:** Initialize your project with:

    ```bash
    uvx --from git+https://github.com/github/spec-kit.git specify init <PROJECT_NAME>
    ```

2.  **Create Your Spec:** Use the `/specify` command to describe your desired application functionality. Focus on the *what* and *why*.

    ```bash
    /specify Build an application that can help me organize my photos in separate photo albums. Albums are grouped by date and can be re-organized by dragging and dropping on the main page. Albums are never in other nested albums. Within each album, photos are previewed in a tile-like interface.
    ```

3.  **Define Your Implementation Plan:** Use the `/plan` command to specify the tech stack and architecture.

    ```bash
    /plan The application uses Vite with minimal number of libraries. Use vanilla HTML, CSS, and JavaScript as much as possible. Images are not uploaded anywhere and metadata is stored in a local SQLite database.
    ```

4.  **Break Down and Implement:** Use `/tasks` to generate tasks and then use your AI agent to implement features.

    For detailed instructions, consult our [comprehensive guide](./spec-driven.md).

## üìö Core Philosophy of Spec-Driven Development

Spec-Driven Development is a structured approach that emphasizes:

*   **Intent-Driven Development:** Prioritizing specifications before implementation.
*   **Rich Specification Creation:** Utilizing guardrails and organizational principles.
*   **Multi-Step Refinement:** Refining specifications and implementations through iterative cycles.
*   **AI-Driven Implementation:** Utilizing advanced AI to interpret specifications and generate code.

## üîç Troubleshooting

### Git Credential Manager on Linux

If you encounter Git authentication issues on Linux:

```bash
#!/usr/bin/env bash
set -e
echo "Downloading Git Credential Manager v2.6.1..."
wget https://github.com/git-ecosystem/git-credential-manager/releases/download/v2.6.1/gcm-linux_amd64.2.6.1.deb
echo "Installing Git Credential Manager..."
sudo dpkg -i gcm-linux_amd64.2.6.1.deb
echo "Configuring Git to use GCM..."
git config --global credential.helper manager
echo "Cleaning up..."
rm gcm-linux_amd64.2.6.1.deb
```
