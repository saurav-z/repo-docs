**Can an AI, like ChatGPT, make smart trading decisions and generate alpha in the stock market?**  This repository documents a live, real-money trading experiment where ChatGPT manages a micro-cap stock portfolio.  [View the original repository](https://github.com/LuckyOne7777/ChatGPT-Micro-Cap-Experiment).

## Key Features:

*   **AI-Powered Trading:** ChatGPT makes daily trading decisions based on provided market data.
*   **Real-World Experiment:** Uses real money ($100 starting capital) to trade micro-cap stocks.
*   **Strict Risk Management:** Stop-loss rules are implemented to manage risk.
*   **Weekly Deep Research:** Allows for thorough account evaluation and research.
*   **Performance Tracking:**  Daily P&L, equity, and trade history are meticulously tracked and published.
*   **Transparency & Documentation:**  All data, decisions, and performance metrics are publicly available.
*   **Visualization Tools:**  Matplotlib graphs compare the portfolio's performance against market benchmarks.
*   **Open Source & Replicable:**  Provides scripts and data for anyone to understand the approach and potentially replicate the experiment.

## Experiment Details:

This project aims to explore the potential of large language models (LLMs) like ChatGPT in financial markets. Each trading day, ChatGPT receives trading data for its portfolio, while adhering to strict stop-loss rules. Weekly, the AI leverages in-depth research to re-evaluate its holdings.

*   **Performance Updates:** Weekly performance data is published on a personal blog ([Here](https://nathanbsmith729.substack.com)).
