*   **Transparent Performance Tracking:** Detailed daily P&L, total equity, and trade history recorded in CSV files.
*   **Visualizations:**  Includes Matplotlib graphs for performance comparison against market indexes.
*   **Automated Logging:** Logs and trade data are auto-saved for complete transparency.
*   **Publicly Available Data:** Weekly performance data and research reports are published for comprehensive analysis.

## The Experiment:  Unveiling AI's Trading Potential

This project is a real-world experiment testing the capabilities of large language models like ChatGPT in the stock market. Starting with a modest budget of $100, the experiment aims to answer a critical question: Can AI-driven strategies generate profits and make informed trading decisions using real-time market data?

**How It Works:**

*   ChatGPT is provided with daily trading data for its portfolio.
*   Strict stop-loss rules are in place to manage risk.
*   Weekly, ChatGPT can leverage deep research to re-evaluate its account.
*   Performance is tracked and published weekly.
