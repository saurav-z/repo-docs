## The Experiment Explained

Inspired by the hype around AI-driven investing, this project sets out to answer a critical question: can large language models make smart trading decisions? Starting with a $100 micro-cap portfolio, ChatGPT is tasked with managing a real-world investment. The experiment follows a clear structure:

*   **Daily Trading:** ChatGPT receives trading data and makes daily decisions.
*   **Strict Stop-Loss Rules:** To manage risk, strict stop-loss orders are implemented.
*   **Weekly Research:** ChatGPT conducts deep research to re-evaluate its portfolio.
*   **Regular Updates:** Performance data and insights are published weekly on [Substack](https://nathanbsmith729.substack.com).
