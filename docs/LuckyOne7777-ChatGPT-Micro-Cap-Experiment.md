# ChatGPT Micro-Cap Experiment: Can AI Beat the Market?

This project dives into the fascinating intersection of artificial intelligence and finance, testing whether ChatGPT can successfully manage a real-money micro-cap portfolio. **[Check out the original repo here](https://github.com/LuckyOne7777/ChatGPT-Micro-Cap-Experiment).**

## Project Overview

This repository documents a live trading experiment where ChatGPT makes real-time trading decisions for a micro-cap portfolio using Python scripts.  The experiment's goal is to determine if large language models like ChatGPT can generate alpha (outperform the market) using real-time data.  The experiment began in June 2023 and concludes in December 2023.
