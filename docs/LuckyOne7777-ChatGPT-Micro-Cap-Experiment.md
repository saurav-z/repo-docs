# Can ChatGPT Beat the Market? A Live Trading Experiment

**Can a large language model like ChatGPT successfully navigate the stock market and generate alpha?** Explore the intriguing experiment detailed in this repository: [ChatGPT-Micro-Cap-Experiment](https://github.com/LuckyOne7777/ChatGPT-Micro-Cap-Experiment). This project puts ChatGPT to the test, managing a real-money micro-cap portfolio with live trading, and provides transparent results and insights.

## Key Features:

*   **Real-Time Trading:** ChatGPT makes daily trading decisions using live market data.
*   **Performance Tracking:** Detailed performance data, including daily P&L, equity, and trade history, is tracked and published.
*   **AI-Powered Decision Making:** Leverages ChatGPT for stock selection and trading strategies.
*   **Strict Risk Management:** Implements stop-loss rules to manage risk.
*   **Weekly Deep Research:** Provides in-depth analysis and reevaluation of the portfolio's holdings on a weekly basis.
*   **Transparent Data:** All trading data, logs, and decisions are recorded and available for analysis.
*   **Visualizations:** Utilizes Matplotlib to compare ChatGPT's performance against market indexes.
*   **Educational Resources:** Includes comprehensive documentation, research summaries, and a Q&A section.

## Project Concept:

This experiment, running from June to December 2025, aims to answer the question: Can AI, specifically ChatGPT, make intelligent trading decisions in the stock market? The project uses a $100 starting budget and provides ChatGPT with market data each trading day, while adhering to strict stop-loss rules. Weekly, the AI uses deep research to re-evaluate its account. This repo offers a transparent look at the process and results, with weekly performance updates available on the author's blog.

## Performance and Results:

The repository includes example performance data, such as the performance from 6/30 to 7/25, demonstrating how the ChatGPT-managed portfolio performs against benchmarks like the Russell 2000.
