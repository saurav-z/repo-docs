**Explore a live trading experiment where ChatGPT manages a micro-cap stock portfolio with real money, answering the question: can AI generate alpha in the stock market?** ([Original Repo](https://github.com/LuckyOne7777/ChatGPT-Micro-Cap-Experiment))

## Key Features:

*   **AI-Driven Trading:** Leverage the power of ChatGPT-5 to make real-time trading decisions.
*   **Real-World Experiment:** Track the performance of a micro-cap stock portfolio with a live budget.
*   **Transparent Data:** Access daily P&L, trade history, and equity data.
*   **Performance Tracking:** Visualize the portfolio's performance compared to market indices using Matplotlib graphs.
*   **Open-Source & Accessible:** Utilize provided scripts and tools as a blueprint to start your own AI-powered trading journey.

## The Concept

Inspired by the increasing interest in AI and the stock market, this project aims to evaluate how well a large language model like ChatGPT can manage a real-money investment portfolio. Starting with $100, this experiment uses ChatGPT to make trading decisions on micro-cap stocks, with strict stop-loss rules and weekly deep research to re-evaluate the account.

## Experiment Details:

*   **Daily Trading:** ChatGPT receives trading data and makes daily trading decisions.
*   **Stop-Loss Strategy:** Adherence to strict stop-loss rules to manage risk.
*   **Weekly Research:** Deep research conducted weekly to optimize the portfolio.
*   **Weekly Performance Tracking:** Monitor the portfolio's performance through detailed documentation and reports.
*   **Live Updates:** The experiment runs from June 2024 to December 2024, and the portfolio's performance will be tracked and updated daily in the portfolio CSV file.

**Research & Documentation:** Comprehensive documentation is available to track the experiment:
