**Discover if a Large Language Model (LLM) like ChatGPT can generate alpha in the stock market with our live trading experiment!** ([Original Repo](https://github.com/LuckyOne7777/ChatGPT-Micro-Cap-Experiment))

This project dives into the intriguing intersection of AI and finance, using ChatGPT to manage a real-money micro-cap portfolio. Follow along as we test the hypothesis: can AI make smart trading decisions using real-time data?

## Key Features

*   **Real-World Trading:** A live experiment trading a micro-cap portfolio with real money.
*   **AI-Driven Decisions:** ChatGPT is the decision engine, choosing trades based on daily data.
*   **Strict Stop-Loss Rules:** Risk management is a priority, with clearly defined stop-loss parameters.
*   **Weekly Deep Research:** ChatGPT gets to re-evaluate the portfolio with in-depth research weekly.
*   **Transparent Performance Tracking:** Daily Profit & Loss (PnL), total equity, and trade history are meticulously tracked and shared.
*   **Data Visualization:**  Matplotlib graphs compare the AI-driven portfolio performance to market indices.
*   **Open-Source & Accessible:** All trading scripts, data, and methodologies are open for you to explore and use.
*   **Regular Updates:** Weekly updates on performance, insights, and learnings on [Substack](https://nathanbsmith729.substack.com).

## The Concept: AI Investing Experiment

Inspired by the buzz around AI-driven investing, this project explores the question: Can a large language model like ChatGPT outperform traditional investment strategies, or at least make smart trading decisions?

Here's how the experiment works:

*   **Daily Data:** ChatGPT receives trading data for its portfolio holdings.
*   **Stop-Loss Discipline:** Stop-loss rules are strictly enforced to manage risk.
*   **Weekly Re-evaluation:** Deep research allows ChatGPT to re-evaluate its account.
*   **Transparency & Results:** Performance data is tracked and published weekly.
