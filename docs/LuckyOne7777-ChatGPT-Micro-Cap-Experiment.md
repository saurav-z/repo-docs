**Can an AI, specifically ChatGPT, generate alpha in the volatile world of micro-cap stocks? This repository documents a live trading experiment to find out.** ([View the original repo](https://github.com/LuckyOne7777/ChatGPT-Micro-Cap-Experiment))

## Project Overview

Inspired by the increasing buzz around AI-driven investment strategies, this project dives headfirst into a real-world test. Beginning with just $100, this experiment tasks ChatGPT with managing a micro-cap stock portfolio, providing daily trading data and weekly deep research opportunities. The goal? To determine if a large language model like ChatGPT can make smart trading decisions and outperform market benchmarks.

## Key Features

*   **AI-Powered Trading:** Harnessing the decision-making capabilities of ChatGPT-5 to identify and execute trades.
*   **Real-Time Data & Stop-Loss Strategy:** Using real-time market data with strict stop-loss rules to manage risk.
*   **Performance Tracking:** Daily P&L, total equity, and trade history are meticulously tracked and recorded in CSV files.
*   **Visualization Tools:** Matplotlib graphs visualize and compare ChatGPT's performance against market indices.
*   **Transparent Logs & Data:** Automated logging of all trades, decisions, and performance metrics for complete transparency.
*   **Weekly Deep Research:** ChatGPT utilizes weekly deep research to re-evaluate its account.
