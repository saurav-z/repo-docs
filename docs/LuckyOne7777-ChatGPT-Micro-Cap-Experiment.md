## Project Overview

This project investigates whether large language models (LLMs) like ChatGPT can make profitable trading decisions in the stock market using real-time data. Starting with a modest budget, the experiment puts AI to the test, aiming to answer a fundamental question: Can AI generate alpha in the stock market?
