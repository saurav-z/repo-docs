## Key Features of the Experiment:

*   **Real-World Trading:** Uses real money and real-time data to make trading decisions.
*   **LLM-Powered:** ChatGPT is the core decision engine, analyzing data and making trade recommendations.
*   **Strict Rules:** Implements stop-loss rules and weekly deep research for disciplined trading.
*   **Transparent Performance Tracking:** Tracks and publishes weekly performance data.
*   **Open-Source and Reproducible:** Provides all code, data, and documentation for transparency and learning.
*   **Live Trading Scripts:** Includes Python scripts for daily price evaluation and portfolio updates.
*   **Automated Logging:** Saves logs and trade data for complete transparency.
*   **Visualization Tools:** Uses Matplotlib to compare ChatGPT performance against market benchmarks.

## The Experiment:

This project started with a simple question: Can large language models (LLMs) like ChatGPT make smart trading decisions using real-time data? The project utilizes $100 to see if ChatGPT can generate alpha.

### Methodology:

*   Daily: ChatGPT receives trading data for stocks in the portfolio.
*   Weekly: Deep research is conducted, allowing ChatGPT to re-evaluate its account.
*   Strict Stop-Losses: Stop-loss rules are strictly applied to manage risk.
*   Transparency: Performance data is tracked and published weekly.
