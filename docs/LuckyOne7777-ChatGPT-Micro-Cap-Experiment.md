## The Concept

Inspired by the common AI-driven investment ads, this project dives into the potential of Large Language Models (LLMs) in financial markets. The experiment starts with a small portfolio and asks a simple question: can ChatGPT generate alpha (or at least make smart trading decisions) using real-time data?

## How it Works

Each trading day involves:

*   Providing ChatGPT with trading data on the portfolio's stocks.
*   Applying strict stop-loss rules to manage risk.
*   Allowing ChatGPT to conduct in-depth research weekly for portfolio re-evaluation.
*   Weekly updates and performance reports available on the author's blog. [SubStack Link](https://nathanbsmith729.substack.com)
