This repository documents a fascinating experiment: can ChatGPT, a large language model, make profitable trading decisions in the micro-cap stock market? Explore the experiment on [GitHub](https://github.com/LuckyOne7777/ChatGPT-Micro-Cap-Experiment).

## Key Features:

*   **Real-World Trading:** A live trading experiment using ChatGPT to manage a real-money micro-cap portfolio.
*   **Daily Data & Analysis:** ChatGPT analyzes daily trading data, applying stop-loss rules, and weekly deep research to inform decisions.
*   **Transparent Performance Tracking:** Weekly performance data, including P&L, equity, and trade history, available via CSV and visualizations.
*   **Open Source:** All code, prompts, and data are available for review and replication.
*   **Automated Logging:** Detailed logs and trade data are automatically saved for transparency.
*   **Performance Visualization:** Tools include Matplotlib graphs comparing ChatGPT performance against market indexes.

## The Experiment:

Driven by curiosity about AI's potential in financial markets, this project answers a crucial question: Can ChatGPT generate alpha, or at least make smart trading decisions using real-time data? Starting with a modest $100, the project aims to:

*   **Leverage AI:** Utilize the power of ChatGPT-5 for stock selection and trading strategies.
*   **Document & Share:** Provide full transparency, including prompts, research, and performance data.
*   **Generate Alpha:** Compare ChatGPT's returns against market benchmarks (e.g. the S&P 500).
