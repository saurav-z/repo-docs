# ChatGPT Micro-Cap Stock Trading Experiment: Can AI Beat the Market?

**This project explores whether ChatGPT can successfully manage a real-money micro-cap stock portfolio.** Dive into the results and the underlying code at the original repository: [https://github.com/LuckyOne7777/ChatGPT-Micro-Cap-Experiment](https://github.com/LuckyOne7777/ChatGPT-Micro-Cap-Experiment).

## Key Features

*   **Real-World Trading:**  ChatGPT manages a live portfolio using real money.
*   **AI-Powered Decisions:**  Large Language Models (LLMs) drive all trading decisions.
*   **Strict Risk Management:** Includes stop-loss rules to protect investments.
*   **Weekly Deep Research:** Allows for in-depth analysis to refine the portfolio strategy.
*   **Detailed Performance Tracking:**  Comprehensive daily and weekly performance data.
*   **Transparent Data:** CSV files with P&L, equity, and trade history.
*   **Visualizations:**  Matplotlib graphs compare the AI's performance against market benchmarks.
*   **Open Source:** Includes live trading scripts and decision-making processes for educational purposes.

## The Experiment

Inspired by the increasing use of AI in financial decision making, this experiment puts ChatGPT's capabilities to the test in the volatile micro-cap stock market.  The goal is to see if an LLM can make smart trading decisions using real-time data and generate alpha.

## How It Works

*   **Daily Data Input:** The AI receives trading data on portfolio stocks each trading day.
*   **Stop-Loss Rules:**  Trades are governed by strict stop-loss rules to manage risk.
*   **Weekly Re-evaluation:** The AI conducts deep research to re-evaluate and optimize the portfolio.
*   **Regular Updates:**  Portfolio performance data is tracked and shared weekly.
