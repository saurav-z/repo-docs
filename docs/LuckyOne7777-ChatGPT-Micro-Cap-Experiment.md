# ChatGPT Micro-Cap Stock Trading Experiment: Can AI Beat the Market?

**This project puts ChatGPT to the test, using real money to trade micro-cap stocks and see if AI can generate alpha.** Dive into the exciting world of AI-driven finance with this open-source experiment.  [See the original repository here](https://github.com/LuckyOne7777/ChatGPT-Micro-Cap-Experiment).

## Key Features:

*   **Real-World Experiment:**  A live trading experiment using ChatGPT to manage a real-money micro-cap portfolio.
*   **Automated Trading:** Utilizes Python scripts for daily trading based on ChatGPT's recommendations.
*   **Performance Tracking:**  Detailed tracking of daily P&L, total equity, and trade history with CSV exports.
*   **Data Visualization:**  Visualizations using Matplotlib to compare ChatGPT's performance against market benchmarks (e.g., Russell 2K).
*   **Transparency:**  Openly available logs and trade data for complete transparency.
*   **Weekly Deep Research:**  ChatGPT utilizes deep research weekly to re-evaluate its positions.

## The Concept:

This project seeks to answer a critical question: Can large language models like ChatGPT make intelligent trading decisions using real-time financial data? Starting with a modest budget, the experiment provides ChatGPT with daily trading data and allows for weekly deep research to refine its strategy. Strict stop-loss rules are applied to manage risk.

## Experiment Details:

*   **Data Input:**  ChatGPT receives daily trading data on portfolio stocks.
*   **Stop-Loss Rules:**  Strict risk management through stop-loss orders.
*   **Weekly Re-evaluation:**  Deep research allows ChatGPT to re-evaluate its account weekly.
*   **Performance Monitoring:** Weekly performance updates and analysis.
