**Discover if large language models like ChatGPT can generate alpha in the stock market with this real-world micro-cap portfolio experiment.** [View the original project on GitHub](https://github.com/LuckyOne7777/ChatGPT-Micro-Cap-Experiment)

This project is a live, six-month experiment where ChatGPT manages a real-money micro-cap portfolio, using real-time data and strict trading rules. We're investigating the potential of AI in finance, with full transparency and publicly available performance data.

## Key Features:

*   **LLM-Powered Trading:** ChatGPT makes all trading decisions.
*   **Real-Time Data & Trading:** Utilizes live market data and a real budget for trading.
*   **Performance Tracking:** Daily Profit and Loss (PnL) records, total equity, and detailed trade history.
*   **Data Visualization:** Matplotlib graphs comparing the ChatGPT-managed portfolio against market indexes.
*   **Transparent Logging:** Automated logs for all trades and decision-making processes.
*   **Open-Source:** Python scripts and datasets are available for public review and replication.

## The Experiment's Methodology:

*   **Initial Investment:** Starting with $100, the portfolio is managed by ChatGPT.
*   **Daily Operations:** ChatGPT receives trading data on the portfolio's stocks. Strict stop-loss rules are in place.
*   **Weekly Deep Research:**  ChatGPT reevaluates its holdings using in-depth research.
*   **Performance Tracking:**  Weekly performance data, including comparisons with the S&P 500, is tracked.
