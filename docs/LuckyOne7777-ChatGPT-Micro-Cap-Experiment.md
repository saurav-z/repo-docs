This repository documents a real-world experiment using ChatGPT to manage a micro-cap stock portfolio, testing the potential of AI in financial trading. [(Original Repo)](https://github.com/LuckyOne7777/ChatGPT-Micro-Cap-Experiment)

## Project Overview

This project explores the application of large language models (LLMs) like ChatGPT in algorithmic trading. The experiment involves a live trading portfolio managed by ChatGPT, with a starting capital of $100, and real-time market data.  The goal is to determine if AI can generate alpha and make effective trading decisions.
