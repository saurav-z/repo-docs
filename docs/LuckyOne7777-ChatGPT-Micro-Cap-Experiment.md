*   **Weekly Deep Research:**  Allows ChatGPT to re-evaluate its account weekly using in-depth research.
*   **Performance Tracking:** Tracks and publishes performance data weekly on a dedicated blog.
*   **Transparent Data & Logs:** Auto-saved logs of trades and comprehensive performance tracking.
*   **Visualization Tools:** Uses Matplotlib to create graphs comparing the AI's performance against market benchmarks.
*   **Open Source for Learning:**  Offers scripts and data as a blueprint for anyone to learn from.

## Project Concept

Inspired by the constant hype around AI-powered investing, this project sets out to test whether large language models like ChatGPT can actually generate returns in the stock market.
