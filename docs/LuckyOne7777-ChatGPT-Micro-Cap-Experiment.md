## Project Overview

This project delves into the exciting question: **Can powerful large language models like ChatGPT generate alpha in the stock market using real-time data?** The experiment, running from June 2024 to December 2024, uses a real-money micro-cap portfolio to test this hypothesis.

Each trading day, ChatGPT receives market data on its portfolio and operates under strict stop-loss rules. Weekly, the AI leverages deep research to re-evaluate its holdings, and the results are tracked and published weekly.
