**Can an AI like ChatGPT successfully manage a real-money investment portfolio?** This repository documents a live trading experiment where ChatGPT makes investment decisions in a micro-cap stock portfolio.  Explore the methodology, results, and code behind this fascinating project.  [See the original repository](https://github.com/LuckyOne7777/ChatGPT-Micro-Cap-Experiment)

## Key Features:

*   **AI-Driven Trading:**  ChatGPT uses real-time data to make daily trading decisions.
*   **Real-World Experiment:**  The project utilizes a live, real-money portfolio with a $100 starting balance.
*   **Strict Risk Management:**  The experiment adheres to strict stop-loss rules to manage risk.
*   **Weekly Deep Research:** ChatGPT re-evaluates its portfolio based on deep research, provided weekly.
*   **Performance Tracking:**  Detailed performance data is meticulously tracked and published weekly, including P&L, total equity, and trade history.
*   **Transparency:**  All trade data, logs, and decision-making processes are documented and available for review.
*   **Visualization:** Includes tools to generate Matplotlib graphs to compare ChatGPT's performance against benchmarks.

## The Concept

Inspired by the growing buzz around AI in finance, this project aims to investigate the potential of large language models like ChatGPT to generate alpha in the stock market.  The experiment began with a $100 portfolio, and will run from June to December 2025.  Every day, ChatGPT receives trading data, and makes decisions based on this information.

## Core Components:

*   **Trading Data Input:** Daily trading data is provided to ChatGPT.
*   **Stop-Loss Rules:** Strict stop-loss rules are implemented to limit potential losses.
*   **Weekly Portfolio Re-evaluation:** ChatGPT conducts deep research and re-evaluates its portfolio every week.
*   **Performance Monitoring:** The project includes weekly performance data, published on the author's blog.

## Results (Example - June 30 - July 25):
