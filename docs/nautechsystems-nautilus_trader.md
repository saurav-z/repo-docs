## Introduction

NautilusTrader is an open-source, production-grade algorithmic trading platform designed for quantitative traders. It allows for backtesting portfolios of automated trading strategies on historical data with an event-driven engine, and also enables live deployment with identical strategy code.

The platform is *AI-first*, designed to develop and deploy algorithmic trading strategies within a highly performant and robust Python-native environment. This helps to address the parity challenge of keeping the Python research/backtest environment consistent with the production live trading environment.

NautilusTrader prioritizes software correctness and safety at the highest level, with the aim of supporting Python-native, mission-critical, trading system backtesting and live deployment workloads.

The platform is also universal, and asset-class-agnostic â€”  with any REST API or WebSocket feed able to be integrated via modular adapters. It supports high-frequency trading across a wide range of asset classes and instrument types including FX, Equities, Futures, Options, Crypto, DeFi, and Betting, enabling seamless operations across multiple venues simultaneously.

> *nautilus - from ancient Greek 'sailor' and naus 'ship'.*
>
> *The nautilus shell consists of modular chambers with a growth factor which approximates a logarithmic spiral.
> The idea is that this can be translated to the aesthetics of design and architecture.*

##  Technology Stack

*   **Rust:** Core components for performance and reliability.
*   **Python:**  User-friendly for strategy development, data science and AI.
*   **Cython:** Bridge the gap between Python and Rust for optimal performance.

### Status

*   `building`: Under construction and likely not in a usable state.
*   `beta`: Completed to a minimally working state and in a beta testing phase.
*   `stable`: Stabilized feature set and API, the integration has been tested by both developers and users to a reasonable level (some bugs may still remain).

See the [Integrations](https://nautilustrader.io/docs/latest/integrations/index.html) documentation for further details.

## Installation

NautilusTrader offers several installation options.  We recommend using the latest supported version of Python and installing [nautilus_trader](https://pypi.org/project/nautilus_trader/) inside a virtual environment to isolate dependencies.

**There are two supported ways to install**:

1.  Pre-built binary wheel from PyPI *or* the Nautech Systems package index.
2.  Build from source.

> [!TIP]
>
> We highly recommend installing using the [uv](https://docs.astral.sh/uv) package manager with a "vanilla" CPython.
>
> Conda and other Python distributions *may* work but arenâ€™t officially supported.

### From PyPI

```bash
pip install -U nautilus_trader
```

### From the Nautech Systems package index

```bash
pip install -U nautilus_trader --index-url=https://packages.nautechsystems.io/simple
```

### From Source

1.  Install [rustup](https://rustup.rs/)
2.  Enable cargo
3.  Install clang
4.  Install uv
5.  Clone the source with `git`
6.  Set environment variables for PyO3 compilation (Linux and macOS only):

See the [Installation Guide](https://nautilustrader.io/docs/latest/getting_started/installation) for more options and further details.

## Redis

Using [Redis](https://redis.io) with NautilusTrader is **optional** and only required if configured as the backend for a
[cache](https://nautilustrader.io/docs/latest/concepts/cache) database or [message bus](https://nautilustrader.io/docs/latest/concepts/message_bus).
See the **Redis** section of the [Installation Guide](https://nautilustrader.io/docs/latest/getting_started/installation#redis) for further details.

## Makefile

A `Makefile` is provided to automate most installation and build tasks for development.

## Examples

Indicators and strategies can be developed in both Python and Cython. For performance and
latency-sensitive applications, we recommend using Cython. Below are some examples:

-   [indicator](/nautilus_trader/examples/indicators/ema_python.py) example written in Python.
-   [indicator](/nautilus_trader/indicators/) examples written in Cython.
-   [strategy](/nautilus_trader/examples/strategies/) examples written in Python.
-   [backtest](/examples/backtest/) examples using a `BacktestEngine` directly.

## Docker

Docker containers are built using the base image `python:3.12-slim` with the following variant tags:

-   `nautilus_trader:latest` has the latest release version installed.
-   `nautilus_trader:nightly` has the head of the `nightly` branch installed.
-   `jupyterlab:latest` has the latest release version installed along with `jupyterlab` and an
    example backtest notebook with accompanying data.
-   `jupyterlab:nightly` has the head of the `nightly` branch installed along with `jupyterlab` and an
    example backtest notebook with accompanying data.
