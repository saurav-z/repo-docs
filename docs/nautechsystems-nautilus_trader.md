![Nautilus Art](https://github.com/nautechsystems/nautilus_trader/raw/develop/assets/nautilus-art.png "nautilus")

> *nautilus - from ancient Greek 'sailor' and naus 'ship'.*
>
> *The nautilus shell consists of modular chambers with a growth factor which approximates a logarithmic spiral. The idea is that this can be translated to the aesthetics of design and architecture.*

## Why Choose NautilusTrader?

*   **Event-Driven Python with Exceptional Performance:** Benefit from native binary core components written in Rust.
*   **Backtesting and Live Trading Parity:** Use identical strategy code for both backtesting and live deployment, reducing development time and risk.
*   **Enhanced Risk Management:** Enjoy increased risk management capabilities, accuracy, and type safety to minimize operational risk.
*   **Extensibility:** Leverage a message bus, custom components, actors, custom data, and custom adapters for a flexible trading environment.

Traditionally, trading strategy research and backtesting would be conducted in Python using vectorized methods. Then, the strategy needs to be reimplemented in a more event-driven way using C++, C#, Java, or other statically typed languages. This is because vectorized backtesting code cannot express the granular time and event-dependent complexity of real-time trading.

A key advantage of NautilusTrader is that the reimplementation step is now circumvented. The critical core components of the platform have been written entirely in [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/) and [Cython](https://cython.org/). This approach utilizes systems programming languages that compile performant binaries. CPython C extension modules then offer a Python-native environment suitable for professional quantitative traders and trading firms.

## Why Python?

Python's clean syntax has made it the *lingua franca* of data science, machine learning, and AI, but it has performance and typing limitations. Cython addresses these issues by introducing static typing into Python's ecosystem.

## Why Rust?

[Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/) is a multi-paradigm programming language designed for performance and safety, especially safe concurrency. Rust is memory-efficient and can power mission-critical systems with no garbage collector. Rustâ€™s rich type system and ownership model guarantees memory-safety and thread-safety.

The project utilizes Rust for core performance-critical components. Python bindings are implemented via Cython and [PyO3](https://pyo3.rs).

The project adheres to the [Soundness Pledge](https://raphlinus.github.io/rust/2020/01/18/soundness-pledge.html).

> [!NOTE]
>
> **MSRV:** NautilusTrader relies heavily on improvements in the Rust language and compiler.
> As a result, the Minimum Supported Rust Version (MSRV) is generally equal to the latest stable release of Rust.

## Integrations

NautilusTrader is modularly designed with *adapters* for seamless connectivity to trading venues and data providers, translating their APIs into a unified interface and normalized domain model.

The following integrations are currently supported; see [docs/integrations/](https://nautilustrader.io/docs/latest/integrations/) for details:

-   **ID**: The default client ID for the integrations adapter clients.
-   **Type**: The type of integration (often the venue type).

### Status

-   `building`: Under construction and likely not in a usable state.
-   `beta`: Completed to a minimally working state and in a beta testing phase.
-   `stable`: Stabilized feature set and API, the integration has been tested by both developers and users to a reasonable level (some bugs may still remain).

See the [Integrations](https://nautilustrader.io/docs/latest/integrations/index.html) documentation for further details.

## Versioning and Releases

**NautilusTrader is under active development**, with potential breaking changes. We document changes in release notes on a best-effort basis.

We aim to follow a **bi-weekly release schedule**, though experimental features may cause delays.

### Branches

We aim to maintain a stable, passing build across all branches.

-   `master`: Reflects the source code for the latest released version; recommended for production use.
-   `nightly`: Daily snapshots of the `develop` branch for early testing; merged at **14:00 UTC** or on demand.
-   `develop`: Active development branch for contributors and feature work.

> [!NOTE]
>
> Our [roadmap](/ROADMAP.md) aims to achieve a **stable API for version 2.x**.
> Once this milestone is reached, we plan to implement a formal deprecation process for any API changes.
> This approach allows us to maintain a rapid development pace for now.

## Precision Mode

NautilusTrader supports two precision modes for its core value types (`Price`, `Quantity`, `Money`):

-   **High-precision**: 128-bit integers with up to 16 decimals of precision, and a larger value range.
-   **Standard-precision**: 64-bit integers with up to 9 decimals of precision, and a smaller value range.

> [!NOTE]
>
> By default, the official Python wheels **ship** in high-precision (128-bit) mode on Linux and macOS.
> On Windows, only standard-precision (64-bit) is available due to the lack of native 128-bit integer support.
> For the Rust crates, the default is standard-precision unless you explicitly enable the `high-precision` feature flag.

See the [Installation Guide](https://nautilustrader.io/docs/latest/getting_started/installation) for further details.

**Rust feature flag**: To enable high-precision mode in Rust, add the `high-precision` feature to your Cargo.toml:

```toml
[dependencies]
nautilus_model = { version = "*", features = ["high-precision"] }
```

## Installation

We recommend installing [nautilus_trader](https://pypi.org/project/nautilus_trader/) inside a virtual environment.

**There are two supported ways to install**:

1.  Pre-built binary wheel from PyPI *or* the Nautech Systems package index.
2.  Build from source.

> [!TIP]
>
> We highly recommend installing using the [uv](https://docs.astral.sh/uv) package manager with a "vanilla" CPython.
>
> Conda and other Python distributions *may* work but arenâ€™t officially supported.

### From PyPI

To install the latest binary wheel (or sdist package) from PyPI using Python's pip package manager:

```bash
pip install -U nautilus_trader
```

### From the Nautech Systems Package Index

The Nautech Systems package index (`packages.nautechsystems.io`) complies with [PEP-503](https://peps.python.org/pep-0503/) and hosts both stable and development binary wheels for `nautilus_trader`.
This enables users to install either the latest stable release or pre-release versions for testing.

#### Stable Wheels

Stable wheels correspond to official releases of `nautilus_trader` on PyPI, and use standard versioning.

To install the latest stable release:

```bash
pip install -U nautilus_trader --index-url=https://packages.nautechsystems.io/simple
```

#### Development Wheels

Development wheels are published from both the `nightly` and `develop` branches,
allowing users to test features and fixes ahead of stable releases.

**Note**: Wheels from the `develop` branch are only built for the Linux x86_64 platform to save time
and compute resources, while `nightly` wheels support additional platforms as shown below.

| Platform           | Nightly | Develop |
| :----------------- | :------ | :------ |
| `Linux (x86_64)`   | âœ“       | âœ“       |
| `Linux (ARM64)`    | âœ“       | -       |
| `macOS (ARM64)`    | âœ“       | -       |
| `Windows (x86_64)` | âœ“       | -       |

This process also helps preserve compute resources and ensures easy access to the exact binaries tested in CI pipelines,
while adhering to [PEP-440](https://peps.python.org/pep-0440/) versioning standards:

-   `develop` wheels use the version format `dev{date}+{build_number}` (e.g., `1.208.0.dev20241212+7001`).
-   `nightly` wheels use the version format `a{date}` (alpha) (e.g., `1.208.0a20241212`).

> [!WARNING]
>
> We do not recommend using development wheels in production environments, such as live trading controlling real capital.

#### Installation Commands

By default, pip will install the latest stable release. Adding the `--pre` flag ensures that pre-release versions, including development wheels, are considered.

To install the latest available pre-release (including development wheels):

```bash
pip install -U nautilus_trader --pre --index-url=https://packages.nautechsystems.io/simple
```

To install a specific development wheel (e.g., `1.208.0a20241212` for December 12, 2024):

```bash
pip install nautilus_trader==1.208.0a20241212 --index-url=https://packages.nautechsystems.io/simple
```

#### Available Versions

You can view all available versions of `nautilus_trader` on the [package index](https://packages.nautechsystems.io/simple/nautilus-trader/index.html).

To programmatically fetch and list available versions:

```bash
curl -s https://packages.nautechsystems.io/simple/nautilus-trader/index.html | grep -oP '(?<=<a href=")[^"]+(?=")' | awk -F'#' '{print $1}' | sort
```

#### Branch Updates

-   `develop` branch wheels (`.dev`): Build and publish continuously with every merged commit.
-   `nightly` branch wheels (`a`): Build and publish daily when we automatically merge the `develop` branch at **14:00 UTC** (if there are changes).

#### Retention Policies

-   `develop` branch wheels (`.dev`): We retain only the most recent wheel build.
-   `nightly` branch wheels (`a`): We retain only the 10 most recent wheel builds.

## Examples

Indicators and strategies can be developed in both Python and Cython. For performance-critical applications, we recommend using Cython. Examples include:

-   [indicator](/nautilus_trader/examples/indicators/ema_python.py) example written in Python.
-   [indicator](/nautilus_trader/indicators/) examples written in Cython.
-   [strategy](/nautilus_trader/examples/strategies/) examples written in Python.
-   [backtest](/examples/backtest/) examples using a `BacktestEngine` directly.

## Docker

Docker containers are built using the base image `python:3.12-slim` with the following variant tags:

-   `nautilus_trader:latest` has the latest release version installed.
-   `nautilus_trader:nightly` has the head of the `nightly` branch installed.
-   `jupyterlab:latest` has the latest release version installed along with `jupyterlab` and an example backtest notebook with accompanying data.
-   `jupyterlab:nightly` has the head of the `nightly` branch installed along with `jupyterlab` and an example backtest notebook with accompanying data.

Pull the container images:

```bash
docker pull ghcr.io/nautechsystems/<image_variant_tag> --platform linux/amd64
```

Launch the backtest example container:

```bash
docker pull ghcr.io/nautechsystems/jupyterlab:nightly --platform linux/amd64
docker run -p 8888:8888 ghcr.io/nautechsystems/jupyterlab:nightly
```

> [!WARNING]
>
> NautilusTrader currently exceeds the rate limit for Jupyter notebook logging (stdout output).
> Therefore, we set the `log_level` to `ERROR` in the examples. Lowering this level to see more
> logging will cause the notebook to hang during cell execution. We are investigating a fix that
> may involve either raising the configured rate limits for Jupyter or throttling the log flushing
> from Nautilus.

## Development

We aim to provide the best developer experience. See the [Developer Guide](https://nautilustrader.io/docs/latest/developer_guide/index.html).

> [!TIP]
>
> Run `make build-debug` to compile after changes to Rust or Cython code for the most efficient development workflow.

### Testing with Rust

[cargo-nextest](https://nexte.st) is the standard Rust test runner for NautilusTrader. Its key benefit is isolating each test.

Install cargo-nextest:

```bash
cargo install cargo-nextest
```

> [!TIP]
>
> Run Rust tests with `make cargo-test`.
