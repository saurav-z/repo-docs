# Falcon: The Fast and Flexible Python Web Framework

**Falcon is a minimalist ASGI/WSGI framework built for blazing-fast REST APIs and microservices.**  This [GitHub repository](https://github.com/falconry/falcon) contains the source code for the Falcon web framework.

## Key Features

*   **ASGI, WSGI, and WebSocket Support:** Build versatile web applications.
*   **Native `asyncio` Support:** Leverage asynchronous programming for performance.
*   **Minimalist Design:**  Focus on the essentials for speed and flexibility.
*   **RESTful Architecture:** Embrace HTTP and REST principles.
*   **High Performance:** Optimized codebase for speed at scale.
*   **Request/Response Classes:** Easy access to headers and bodies.
*   **Middleware and Hooks:** DRY request processing.
*   **Strict RFC Adherence:** Ensure standards compliance.
*   **Idiomatic Error Handling:**  Clear and concise error responses.
*   **CPython 3.9+ and PyPy 3.9+ Support:** Broad compatibility.
*   **Simple API Modeling:** Through centralized RESTful routing.

## How is Falcon Different?

Falcon is engineered to be **Reliable, Debuggable, Fast, and Flexible**:

*   **Reliable:**  Emphasis on backwards-compatibility and rigorous testing.  Minimal dependencies to reduce attack surface.
*   **Debuggable:**  Avoids "magic" and provides clear input/output paths.
*   **Fast:**  Significantly faster than other popular Python frameworks. Supports Cython and PyPy for extra speed boosts.
*   **Flexible:** Gives you control over implementation details, allowing for customization.

```

## Dependencies

Falcon has no dependencies outside of the Python standard library.

## Getting Started

Here's a basic WSGI example:

```python
# examples/things.py
from wsgiref.simple_server import make_server
import falcon

class ThingsResource:
    def on_get(self, req, resp):
        resp.status = falcon.HTTP_200
        resp.content_type = falcon.MEDIA_TEXT
        resp.text = "Two things..."

app = falcon.App()
things = ThingsResource()
app.add_route('/things', things)

if __name__ == '__main__':
    with make_server('', 8000, app) as httpd:
        print('Serving on port 8000...')
        httpd.serve_forever()
```

Run with:

```bash
$ pip install falcon
$ python things.py
```

And test with:

```bash
$ curl localhost:8000/things
```

(Similar ASGI example included in original README.)
