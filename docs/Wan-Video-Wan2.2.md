# Wan2.2: Unleash Cinematic Video Generation with Open-Source AI

**Wan2.2** ([Original Repo](https://github.com/Wan-Video/Wan2.2)) is a cutting-edge open-source video generation model pushing the boundaries of AI-driven video creation.  Generate stunning, high-definition videos from text, images, or audio with unparalleled speed and quality.

**Key Features:**

*   üëç **MoE Architecture:** Utilizes a Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) architecture for increased model capacity while maintaining efficient computation.
*   üëç **Cinematic Aesthetics:** Incorporates curated aesthetic data for precise control over lighting, composition, and color grading, enabling cinematic-quality video generation.
*   üëç **Advanced Motion Generation:** Trained on a significantly expanded dataset (+65.6% images, +83.2% videos) compared to Wan2.1, resulting in improved generalization across motions, semantics, and aesthetics.
*   üëç **Efficient High-Definition Hybrid TI2V:** Open-sources a 5B model with a compression ratio of 16x16x4, supporting 720P@24fps text-to-video and image-to-video generation on consumer-grade GPUs like the 4090.
