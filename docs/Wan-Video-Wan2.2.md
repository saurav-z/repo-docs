##  Introduction of Wan2.2

**Wan2.2** builds on the foundation of Wan2.1 with notable improvements in generation quality and model capability. This upgrade is driven by a series of key technical innovations, mainly including the Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) architecture, upgraded training data, and high-compression video generation.

##### (1) Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) Architecture

Wan2.2 introduces Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) architecture into the video generation diffusion model. MoE has been widely validated in large language models as an efficient approach to increase total model parameters while keeping inference cost nearly unchanged. In Wan2.2, the A14B model series adopts a two-expert design tailored to the denoising process of diffusion models: a high-noise expert for the early stages, focusing on overall layout; and a low-noise expert for the later stages, refining video details. Each expert model has about 14B parameters, resulting in a total of 27B parameters but only 14B active parameters per step, keeping inference computation and GPU memory nearly unchanged.

</div>

The transition point between the two experts is determined by the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR), a metric that decreases monotonically as the denoising step $t$ increases. At the beginning of the denoising process, $t$ is large and the noise level is high, so the SNR is at its minimum, denoted as ${SNR}_{min}$. In this stage, the high-noise expert is activated. We define a threshold step ${t}_{moe}$ corresponding to half of the ${SNR}_{min}$, and switch to the low-noise expert when $t<{t}_{moe}$.

    <img src="assets/moe_2.png" alt="" style="width: 90%;" />
</div>

To validate the effectiveness of the MoE architecture, four settings are compared based on their validation loss curves. The baseline **Wan2.1** model does not employ the MoE architecture. Among the MoE-based variants, the **Wan2.1 & High-Noise Expert** reuses the Wan2.1 model as the low-noise expert while uses the  Wan2.2's high-noise expert, while the **Wan2.1 & Low-Noise Expert** uses Wan2.1 as the high-noise expert and employ the Wan2.2's low-noise expert. The **Wan2.2 (MoE)** (our final version) achieves the lowest validation loss, indicating that its generated video distribution is closest to ground-truth and exhibits superior convergence.


##### (2) Efficient High-Definition Hybrid TI2V
To enable more efficient deployment, Wan2.2 also explores a high-compression design. In addition to the 27B MoE models, a 5B dense model, i.e., TI2V-5B, is released. It is supported by a high-compression Wan2.2-VAE, which achieves a $T\times H\times W$ compression ratio of $4\times16\times16$, increasing the overall compression rate to 64 while maintaining high-quality video reconstruction. With an additional patchification layer, the total compression ratio of TI2V-5B reaches $4\times32\times32$. Without specific optimization, TI2V-5B can generate a 5-second 720P video in under 9 minutes on a single consumer-grade GPU, ranking among the fastest 720P@24fps video generation models. This model also natively supports both text-to-video and image-to-video tasks within a single unified framework, covering both academic research and practical applications.

##### Comparisons to SOTAs
We compared Wan2.2 with leading closed-source commercial models on our new Wan-Bench 2.0, evaluating performance across multiple crucial dimensions. The results demonstrate that Wan2.2 achieves superior performance compared to these leading models.
