# Wan2.2: Unleashing the Power of Open Video Generation

**Wan2.2 is a cutting-edge open-source video generation model, offering unparalleled cinematic aesthetics and complex motion generation capabilities. [Explore the original repository](https://github.com/Wan-Video/Wan2.2).**

## Key Features

*   **Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) Architecture:**  Leverages a novel MoE architecture for efficient and high-quality video generation, optimizing model capacity while maintaining computational efficiency.
*   **Cinematic-Level Aesthetics:** Trained on meticulously curated aesthetic data with detailed labels, enabling precise control over lighting, composition, color, and style.
*   **Enhanced Motion Generation:** Trained on significantly expanded datasets for improved motion dynamics, semantic understanding, and aesthetic diversity, achieving top performance among open-source and closed-source models.
*   **Efficient High-Definition Hybrid TI2V:**  Features a 5B parameter model (TI2V-5B) with advanced Wan2.2-VAE, supporting text-to-video and image-to-video generation at 720P resolution and 24fps on consumer-grade GPUs like the 4090.

python generate.py --task i2v-A14B --size 1280*720 --ckpt_dir ./Wan2.2-I2V-A14B --offload_model True --convert_model_dtype --image examples/i2v_input.JPG --prompt "Summer beach vacation style, a white cat wearing sunglasses sits on a surfboard. The fluffy-furred feline gazes directly at the camera with a relaxed expression. Blurred beach scenery forms the background featuring crystal-clear waters, distant green hills, and a blue sky dotted with white clouds. The cat assumes a naturally relaxed posture, as if savoring the sea breeze and warm sunlight. A close-up shot highlights the feline's intricate details and the refreshing atmosphere of the seaside."
```

**Text-Image-to-Video Generation:**

```bash
python generate.py --task ti2v-5B --size 1280*704 --ckpt_dir ./Wan2.2-TI2V-5B --offload_model True --convert_model_dtype --t5_cpu --image examples/i2v_input.JPG --prompt "Summer beach vacation style, a white cat wearing sunglasses sits on a surfboard.
