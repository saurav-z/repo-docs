## SGLang: High-Performance Serving Framework for LLMs

SGLang empowers faster and more controllable interactions with large language models by co-designing a backend runtime and frontend language.  [Explore the original repository](https://github.com/sgl-project/sglang).

**Key Features:**

*   **Blazing Fast Backend Runtime:**
    *   RadixAttention for efficient prefix caching.
    *   Zero-overhead CPU scheduler.
    *   Prefill-decode disaggregation for optimized processing.
    *   Speculative decoding for improved speed.
    *   Continuous batching for efficient resource utilization.
    *   Paged attention for memory efficiency.
    *   Tensor, pipeline, and expert parallelism for scaling.
    *   Support for structured outputs.
    *   Chunked prefill for large context windows.
    *   Quantization (FP8/INT4/AWQ/GPTQ) for reduced memory footprint.
    *   Multi-LoRA batching for flexible model configurations.

*   **Flexible Frontend Language:**
    *   Intuitive interface for LLM application development.
    *   Chained generation calls for complex tasks.
    *   Advanced prompting capabilities.
    *   Control flow structures for dynamic logic.
    *   Multi-modal input support.
    *   Parallelism for improved performance.
    *   External interaction capabilities for seamless integration.

*   **Extensive Model Support:**
    *   Supports a wide range of generative models (Llama, Gemma, Mistral, Qwen, DeepSeek, LLaVA, etc.).
    *   Compatible with various embedding models (e5-mistral, gte, mcdse).
    *   Includes support for reward models (Skywork).
    *   Easy extensibility for integrating new models.

*   **Active Community and Industry Adoption:**
    *   Open-source project with a vibrant and supportive community.
    *   Trusted and adopted by leading enterprises and institutions, generating trillions of tokens daily in production.
