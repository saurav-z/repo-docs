## SGLang: The High-Performance Serving Framework for LLMs and VLM

SGLang is a powerful, open-source framework designed to accelerate the serving of large language models (LLMs) and vision language models (VLMs), offering both a fast backend runtime and a flexible frontend language.  [Visit the original repo](https://github.com/sgl-project/sglang) for more details.

### Key Features

*   **Blazing-Fast Backend Runtime:**
    *   Optimized with RadixAttention for efficient prefix caching and accelerated decoding.
    *   Includes a zero-overhead CPU scheduler and intelligent load balancing.
    *   Supports advanced techniques like prefill-decode disaggregation, speculative decoding, and continuous batching.
    *   Offers features like paged attention, tensor/pipeline/expert parallelism for maximum performance.
    *   Optimized for structured outputs and supports quantization (FP8/INT4/AWQ/GPTQ).
    *   Supports multi-LoRA batching.

*   **Intuitive Frontend Language:**
    *   Easy-to-use interface for building LLM applications with chained generation calls.
    *   Supports advanced prompting, control flow, and multi-modal inputs.
    *   Enables parallel processing and integration with external services.

*   **Extensive Model Support:**
    *   Broad compatibility with popular generative models (Llama, Gemma, Mistral, Qwen, DeepSeek, LLaVA, etc.).
    *   Supports various embedding models (e5-mistral, gte, mcdse).
    *   Includes support for reward models (Skywork).
    *   Designed for easy integration of new models.

*   **Thriving Community & Industry Adoption:**
    *   Open-source and backed by an active community.
    *   Used in production environments, generating trillions of tokens daily.
