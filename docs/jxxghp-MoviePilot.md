## Development

### Prerequisites

*   Python 3.12
*   Node.js v20.12.1

### Getting Started

1.  **Clone the main repository:**

    ```shell
    git clone https://github.com/jxxghp/MoviePilot
    ```

2.  **Clone the resources repository:**

    ```shell
    git clone https://github.com/jxxghp/MoviePilot-Resources
    ```
    Copy the necessary `.so`/`.pyd`/`.bin` files from the `MoviePilot-Resources/resources` directory to the `app/helper` directory of the main project, corresponding to your platform and version.

3.  **Install backend dependencies and run the backend:**

    ```shell
    cd MoviePilot
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    python3 main.py
    ```

    The backend will run on port `3001` by default.  API documentation is available at `http://localhost:3001/docs`.

4.  **Clone and run the frontend:**

    ```shell
    cd MoviePilot
    git clone https://github.com/jxxghp/MoviePilot-Frontend
    cd MoviePilot-Frontend
    yarn
    yarn dev
    ```

    The frontend will be accessible at `http://localhost:5173`.

5.  **Plugin Development:**  Refer to the [Plugin Development Guide](https://wiki.movie-pilot.org/zh/plugindev) to create custom plugins within the `app/plugins` directory.
