# R-Zero: Self-Evolving Reasoning LLM from Zero Data

**R-Zero revolutionizes Large Language Models by enabling them to autonomously develop reasoning skills from scratch, without any pre-existing data.**

[View the original repository on GitHub](https://github.com/Chengsong-Huang/R-Zero)

## Key Features

*   **Autonomous Learning:** Trains LLMs from a blank slate, requiring no initial datasets or human annotations.
*   **Co-Evolutionary Loop:**  Employs a Challenger-Solver dynamic for continuous, adaptive learning. The Challenger generates challenging problems, and the Solver improves by solving them.
*   **Superior Performance:** Achieves significant performance improvements across multiple reasoning benchmarks.
*   **Strong Generalization:** Reasoning skills learned on specific domains transfer effectively to general reasoning tasks.
*   **Model-Agnostic:** Enhances the reasoning capabilities of various base LLMs.

## üî• What's New

*   **[2025-8-27]** Analysis on iteration scaling and one model taking on two roles added.
*   **[2025-8-25]** Code updates to improve training smoothness (using stopit).
*   **[2025-8-8]** R-Zero recognized as `#2 Paper of the day` on [huggingface daily paper](https://huggingface.co/papers/2508.05004).
*   **[2025-8-7]** Paper and code released.

## üß† Overview

R-Zero is a groundbreaking framework that empowers LLMs to self-improve their reasoning abilities. Unlike traditional methods that rely on large, curated datasets, R-Zero starts with a base model and fosters a dynamic co-evolution between two key components:

*   **The Challenger:**  Generates challenging problems to push the Solver to its limits.
*   **The Solver:**  Continuously improves by solving the problems posed by the Challenger.

This iterative process creates a tailored learning curriculum.  The Challenger learns to ask more effective questions, and the Solver learns to provide more accurate answers. R-Zero utilizes techniques like majority voting and relative policy optimization within a self-contained loop, eliminating the need for external data.

## üöÄ Quickstart Guide

Get started with R-Zero in a few simple steps:

### 1. Set Up Your Environment

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Chengsong-Huang/R-Zero.git
cd R-Zero
pip install -r requirements.txt
export STORAGE_PATH="/path/to/your/storage" # Set your storage directory
export HUGGINGFACENAME="yourhuggingfacename" # Set your Hugging Face username

mkdir -p "$STORAGE_PATH/evaluation" "$STORAGE_PATH/models" "$STORAGE_PATH/generated_question" "$STORAGE_PATH/temp_results"
```

### 2.  Configure API Keys

*   Add your Hugging Face and WandB API keys in `tokens.json`.
*   Provide your OpenAI GPT API key in `evaluation/results_recheck.py` for evaluation.

### 3. Run the Experiments

Replicate the experiments with this script:

```bash
# Replace with your base model name and abbreviation
bash scripts/main.sh [Base_Model_Name] [Abbreviation]

# Example:
bash scripts/main.sh Qwen/Qwen3-4B-Base qwen3-4b
```

## ‚ùì Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ)

### Hardware Setup for Experiments?

**A:** Experiments were performed on an 8-GPU server. You might need to adjust the code for larger models or different hardware.

### Environment Configuration Issues?

**A:**  Refer to the setup instructions or Docker environment of [EasyR1](https://github.com/hiyouga/EasyR1/tree/main) for guidance.

### Training Logs and Checkpoints?

**A:** All generated data is stored in the directory specified by the `STORAGE_PATH` environment variable.  Datasets are sent to Hugging Face via `HUGGINGFACENAME`.

### Code Getting Stuck During Training?

**A:** A timeout mechanism is in place to address potential infinite loops. If the issue persists, restart training from the last saved checkpoint.
