## Overview

[![R-Zero Overview](./figs/abstract.png)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.05004)

Training reasoning models typically demands massive, curated datasets, which are expensive and challenging to scale. R-Zero addresses this challenge with a novel framework. It allows LLMs to autonomously improve their reasoning skills. The process begins without any pre-existing tasks or labels, creating a self-evolving system that learns from the ground up.

R-Zero's core is a dynamic co-evolutionary loop between two instances of the same base model:

1.  **Challenger ðŸŽ¯:** Probes the Solver for weaknesses by generating challenging problems.
2.  **Solver ðŸ§ :** Continuously improves by tackling the increasingly complex tasks from the Challenger.

This creates a tailored, adaptive curriculum. The Challenger learns to formulate more complex questions, while the Solver learns to provide improved answers. The entire cycle is self-contained, employing majority voting for pseudo-labels and relative policy optimization.

## Quickstart Guide

### 1. Environment Setup

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Chengsong-Huang/R-Zero.git
cd R-Zero
pip install -r requirements.txt
export STORAGE_PATH="/path/to/your/storage"
export HUGGINGFACENAME="yourhuggingfacename"

mkdir -p \
  "$STORAGE_PATH/evaluation" \
  "$STORAGE_PATH/models" \
  "$STORAGE_PATH/generated_question" \
  "$STORAGE_PATH/temp_results"
```

### 2. API Keys

*   Add your API keys for **Hugging Face** and **WandB** in `tokens.json`.
*   Add your **OpenAI GPT** API key in `evaluation/results_recheck.py` for evaluation.

### 3. Run Experiments

Replicate the results using this script:

```bash
# The script takes the base model name and an abbreviation as arguments
# The abbreviation is used for creating a directory to save the model.
# Format: bash scripts/main.sh [Base_Model_Name] [Abbreviation]

# Example using Qwen/Qwen3-4B-Base:
bash scripts/main.sh Qwen/Qwen3-4B-Base qwen3-4b
```

## Impressive Results

*   **R-Zero shows significant improvements over base models and baseline challengers.**

## FAQ for Developers

### Hardware Setup?

Experiments used an 8-GPU server.  Modify code as needed for different hardware.

### Environment Configuration?

Refer to [EasyR1](https://github.com/hiyouga/EasyR1/tree/main) for setup guidance, or use their Docker environment.

### Where are training logs and model checkpoints saved?

Logs, datasets, and model checkpoints are stored in the `STORAGE_PATH`. Datasets are also sent to Hugging Face under `HUGGINGFACENAME`.

### Code getting stuck?

Restart training from the last saved checkpoint if the questioner training process gets stuck (likely due to an infinite loop in the math\_verify lib).
