# R-Zero: Self-Evolving Reasoning for LLMs - Train from Zero Data

**R-Zero empowers Large Language Models to autonomously enhance their reasoning abilities without any pre-existing datasets.** ([Original Repo](https://github.com/Chengsong-Huang/R-Zero))

R-Zero introduces a novel framework that enables LLMs to learn and evolve their reasoning skills from scratch, eliminating the need for expensive, human-curated data. Through a self-contained co-evolutionary loop, R-Zero allows LLMs to continuously improve, demonstrating significant performance gains across various benchmarks.

## Key Features

*   üöÄ **Fully Autonomous:** Operates without any initial training data or labeled examples.
*   üîÑ **Co-Evolutionary Loop:** A dynamic Challenger-Solver system creates a tailored curriculum for continuous improvement.
*   üìà **Proven Performance:** Achieves substantial performance boosts on various reasoning benchmarks.
*   üß† **Strong Generalization:** Reasoning skills learned in one domain effectively transfer to general reasoning tasks.
*   ‚öôÔ∏è **Model-Agnostic:** Consistently enhances the performance of various base LLMs.

## üî• Updates

*   **2025-8-27:** Analysis on iteration scaling and one model taking on two roles.
*   **2025-8-25:** Code updates for smoother training (using stopit).
*   **2025-8-8:** R-Zero earned `#2 Paper of the day` on [Hugging Face Daily Papers](https://huggingface.co/papers/2508.05004).
*   **2025-8-7:** Paper and code release.

## ‚ö°Ô∏è Quickstart

Get up and running with R-Zero in a few simple steps:

### 1.  Environment Setup

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Chengsong-Huang/R-Zero.git
cd R-Zero
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Set up environment variables
export STORAGE_PATH="/path/to/your/storage"
export HUGGINGFACENAME="yourhuggingfacename"

mkdir -p "$STORAGE_PATH/evaluation" "$STORAGE_PATH/models" "$STORAGE_PATH/generated_question" "$STORAGE_PATH/temp_results"
```

### 2.  API Key Configuration

*   Add your **Hugging Face** and **WandB** API keys to `tokens.json`.
*   Add your **OpenAI GPT** API key to `evaluation/results_recheck.py`.

### 3.  Run the Experiments

Replicate the reported results with a single command:

```bash
# Format: bash scripts/main.sh [Base_Model_Name] [Abbreviation]
# Example:
bash scripts/main.sh Qwen/Qwen3-4B-Base qwen3-4b
```

## üìä Impressive Results

R-Zero demonstrates significant performance improvements across various reasoning benchmarks. The table below compares the performance of base models, the Zero-Shot Challenger, and R-Zero over multiple iterations.  Peak performance for each model is **bolded**.

## ‚ùì FAQ

**Q: What are the hardware requirements for running experiments?**

**A:** Experiments were conducted on an 8-GPU server. Models should fit on a single GPU (e.g., 4B or 8B models). For larger models or different hardware setups, code modifications may be necessary.

**Q:  What if I run into environment configuration problems during installation?**

**A:**  This project is inspired by [EasyR1](https://github.com/hiyouga/EasyR1/tree/main).  Refer to their setup instructions or consider using their Docker environment for assistance.

**Q: Where are the training logs and checkpoints stored?**

**A:** All generated data, including logs, datasets, and model checkpoints, are saved in the directory specified by the `STORAGE_PATH` environment variable.  Datasets are also sent to Hugging Face via `HUGGINGFACENAME`.

**Q: What if the code gets stuck during the questioner training process?**

**A:** This may be due to a bug in the `math_verify` library. Implement a timeout control to mitigate this, but it may not catch all cases. If this issue arises, restart training from the last saved checkpoint.
