## Overview

![Abstract](figs/abstract.png)

Traditional methods for training powerful reasoning models rely on extensive, manually curated datasets, which are costly and difficult to scale. R-Zero introduces a groundbreaking framework that allows LLMs to self-improve their reasoning skills without any pre-existing tasks or labeled data.

R-Zero uses a co-evolutionary loop between two components:

*   **Challenger ðŸŽ¯:**  Probes the Solver for weaknesses and creates challenging problems.
*   **Solver ðŸ§ :**  Continuously improves by solving the increasingly difficult tasks from the Challenger.

This creates a self-contained, adaptive curriculum where the Challenger asks better questions and the Solver learns better answers.  The system employs techniques like majority voting for pseudo-labels and relative policy optimization to guide learning.

## Quickstart Guide

Get up and running quickly with these steps:

### 1.  Environment Setup

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Chengsong-Huang/R-Zero.git
cd R-Zero
pip install -r requirements.txt
export STORAGE_PATH="/path/to/your/storage"  # Set a path for checkpoints and generated data
export HUGGINGFACENAME="yourhuggingfacename" # Set the Hugging Face name
mkdir -p \
  "$STORAGE_PATH/evaluation" \
  "$STORAGE_PATH/models" \
  "$STORAGE_PATH/generated_question" \
  "$STORAGE_PATH/temp_results"
```

### 2.  API Key Configuration

*   Add your Hugging Face and WandB API keys to `tokens.json`.
*   Add your OpenAI GPT API key to `evaluation/results_recheck.py` for evaluation.

### 3.  Run the Experiments

Replicate our experimental results with a single script:

```bash
# Run with: bash scripts/main.sh [Base_Model_Name] [Abbreviation]
# Example: bash scripts/main.sh Qwen/Qwen3-4B-Base qwen3-4b
```

## Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ)

### Q: What hardware is required for experiments?

**A:** Experiments were performed on an 8-GPU server using models that fit on a single GPU (e.g., 4B or 8B). You may need to adjust the code for larger models or different hardware.

### Q:  How do I resolve environment configuration issues?

**A:** R-Zero's structure is based on [EasyR1](https://github.com/hiyouga/EasyR1/tree/main). Consult their setup instructions or use their Docker environment for guidance.

### Q: Where are training logs and model checkpoints saved?

**A:** All data, including logs, datasets, and checkpoints, is saved in the directory set by the `STORAGE_PATH` environment variable. Datasets are also sent to Hugging Face via `HUGGINGFACENAME`.

### Q: What if the code gets stuck during training?

**A:**  A timeout has been added to `math_verify` to handle potential infinite loops. If problems persist, restart training from the latest checkpoint.
