# R-Zero: Revolutionizing Reasoning in LLMs with Self-Evolving Intelligence

**R-Zero is a groundbreaking framework that enables Large Language Models (LLMs) to autonomously improve their reasoning abilities from scratch, without any pre-existing data.** ([Original Repo](https://github.com/Chengsong-Huang/R-Zero))

## Key Features

*   ‚úÖ **Autonomous Learning:** R-Zero starts with a base model and requires no external datasets or human-labeled examples.
*   üîÑ **Co-Evolutionary Loop:**  A "Challenger" model generates increasingly complex problems, driving the "Solver" model to continually enhance its reasoning skills.
*   üìà **Performance Boosts:** Demonstrates significant improvements on various reasoning benchmarks.
*   üåê **Strong Generalization:** Reasoning skills learned in specific domains effectively transfer to broader reasoning tasks.
*   ‚öôÔ∏è **Model-Agnostic:** R-Zero enhances the performance of diverse base LLMs.

## üöÄ Updates

*   [2025-08-12] Updated codes to improve training smoothness.
*   [2025-08-08]  R-Zero was recognized as `#2 Paper of the day` on [huggingface daily paper](https://huggingface.co/papers/2508.05004).
*   [2025-08-07]  Released our [paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.05004) and code.

## üßê Overview

[![R-Zero Overview](figs/abstract.png)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.05004)

Traditional methods for training powerful reasoning models rely on large, manually curated datasets, which are costly and difficult to scale. R-Zero offers a novel approach: a self-evolving system that empowers LLMs to learn and improve their reasoning abilities autonomously.

R-Zero leverages a dynamic co-evolutionary loop between two instances of the same base model:

1.  **Challenger üéØ:**  Probes the Solver for weaknesses, creating challenging problems that push its boundaries.
2.  **Solver üß†:**  Continuously improves by solving the increasingly difficult tasks posed by the Challenger.

This process creates a perfectly tailored, adaptive learning curriculum.  The Challenger learns to ask better questions, and the Solver learns to find better answers, all self-contained and using techniques like majority voting and relative policy optimization.

## üèÅ Quickstart Guide

Get started with R-Zero quickly using these steps:

### 1. Set Up Your Environment

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Chengsong-Huang/R-Zero.git
cd R-Zero
pip install -r requirements.txt
export STORAGE_PATH="/path/to/your/storage"  # Set your storage directory
export HUGGINGFACENAME="yourhuggingfacename" # Set your Hugging Face username
mkdir -p "$STORAGE_PATH/evaluation" "$STORAGE_PATH/models" "$STORAGE_PATH/generated_question" "$STORAGE_PATH/temp_results"
```

### 2. Configure API Keys

*   Add your **Hugging Face** and **WandB** API keys to `tokens.json`.
*   Add your **OpenAI GPT** API key in `evaluation/results_recheck.py` for evaluation purposes.

### 3. Run Experiments

Replicate our results using a single script:

```bash
# Specify the base model name and an abbreviation
#  e.g., bash scripts/main.sh Qwen/Qwen3-4B-Base qwen3-4b
bash scripts/main.sh [Base_Model_Name] [Abbreviation]
```

## ‚ùì FAQ for Developers

### Q: What is the hardware setup for experiments?

**A:** All experiments were conducted on an 8-GPU server using models that can be run on a single GPU (4B or 8B). Adapt the code as needed for larger models or different hardware.

### Q: Environment configuration issues during installation?

**A:**  Refer to the setup instructions or Docker environment of [EasyR1](https://github.com/hiyouga/EasyR1/tree/main) for troubleshooting.

### Q: Where are training logs and model checkpoints saved?

**A:**  Generated data, including logs, datasets, and checkpoints, are stored in the directory specified by the `STORAGE_PATH` environment variable. Datasets will also be sent to Hugging Face via `HUGGINGFACENAME`.

### Q: Code stuck during questioner training?

**A:** This may be due to a bug in the `math_verify` library. Restart training from the last saved checkpoint.
