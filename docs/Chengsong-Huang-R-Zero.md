## Overview

[![R-Zero Overview](./figs/abstract.png)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.05004)

Training powerful reasoning models typically necessitates extensive human-curated data, which is expensive and difficult to scale. R-Zero is a novel framework that enables LLMs to enhance their reasoning capabilities autonomously, without relying on any pre-existing tasks or labels. It's a self-evolving system designed to learn from the ground up.

R-Zero establishes a dynamic co-evolutionary loop between two instances of the same base model:

1.  **Challenger ðŸŽ¯:** Generates challenging problems to expose the Solver's weaknesses, pushing it to its limits.
2.  **Solver ðŸ§ :** Continuously improves by tackling increasingly difficult tasks posed by the Challenger.

This process creates a perfectly tailored, adaptive learning curriculum. The Challenger hones its question-asking abilities, while the Solver refines its problem-solving skills. The entire cycle is self-contained, using techniques like majority voting for pseudo-labels and relative policy optimization to guide the learning process.

## Quickstart Guide

Follow these steps to get started:

### 1. Configure Environment and Prepare Directories

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Chengsong-Huang/R-Zero.git

cd R-Zero

pip install -r requirements.txt

export STORAGE_PATH="/path/to/your/storage"
export HUGGINGFACENAME="yourhuggingfacename"

mkdir -p \
  "$STORAGE_PATH/evaluation" \
  "$STORAGE_PATH/models" \
  "$STORAGE_PATH/generated_question" \
  "$STORAGE_PATH/temp_results"
```

### 2. Add API Keys

*   Add your Hugging Face and WandB (for logging) API keys to `tokens.json`.
*   Add your OpenAI GPT API key for evaluation in `evaluation/results_recheck.py`.

### 3. Run Experiments

Replicate the results with a single script:

```bash
# The script takes the base model name and an abbreviation as arguments
# The abbreviation is used for creating a directory to save the model.
# Format: bash scripts/main.sh [Base_Model_Name] [Abbreviation]

# Example using Qwen/Qwen3-4B-Base:
bash scripts/main.sh Qwen/Qwen3-4B-Base qwen3-4b
```

## FAQ for Developers

### **Q: What hardware is required for experiments?**

**A:** The experiments were conducted on an 8-GPU server with models that can run on a single GPU (e.g., 4B or 8B). You may need to modify the code for larger models or different hardware setups.

### **Q:  How to handle environment configuration problems during installation?**

**A:** The framework is inspired by [EasyR1](https://github.com/hiyouga/EasyR1/tree/main).  Refer to their setup instructions or their Docker environment for assistance.

### **Q: Where are training logs and model checkpoints saved?**

**A:** All generated data, including logs, datasets, and model checkpoints, are saved in the directory specified by the `STORAGE_PATH` environment variable. Datasets are also uploaded to Hugging Face via `HUGGINGFACENAME`.

### **Q: What if the code gets stuck during the questioner training?**

**A:**  This may be due to a bug in the `math_verify` library.  A timeout control is in place, but if this occurs, restart training from the last saved checkpoint.
