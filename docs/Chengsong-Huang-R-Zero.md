# R-Zero: Self-Evolving Reasoning LLM from Zero Data

**R-Zero is a revolutionary framework that empowers Large Language Models to learn reasoning skills autonomously, starting with no pre-existing data.** ([Original Repo](https://github.com/Chengsong-Huang/R-Zero))

## Key Features

*   **Fully Autonomous Learning:** Trains LLMs from scratch, eliminating the need for labeled datasets or pre-existing problem sets.
*   **Co-Evolutionary Dynamics:** Employs a Challenger-Solver loop, creating a dynamic and adaptive curriculum for continuous reasoning improvement.
*   **Proven Performance Gains:** Demonstrates significant performance boosts across various reasoning benchmarks.
*   **Strong Generalization:** Reasoning skills learned are transferable to general reasoning tasks.
*   **Model Agnostic:** Enhances the performance of a variety of base LLMs.

## üöÄ Overview

R-Zero overcomes the limitations of traditional reasoning model training by enabling LLMs to self-improve without any external data. This innovative framework utilizes a co-evolutionary approach:

*   **Challenger:** This component generates challenging problems designed to identify and expose weaknesses in the Solver.
*   **Solver:** This component focuses on solving the increasingly difficult tasks posed by the Challenger, thus continuously improving its reasoning abilities.

This self-contained cycle utilizes techniques such as majority voting for pseudo-labeling and relative policy optimization, leading to a perfectly tailored and adaptive learning process.

## üìä Impressive Results

R-Zero shows remarkable improvements across several reasoning benchmarks. The table below compares the performance of Base Models, Zero-Shot Challenger baselines, and the iterative R-Zero framework. Peak performance for each model is highlighted in **bold**.

## üõ†Ô∏è Quickstart Guide

### 1.  Set Up Your Environment and Prepare Directories
```bash
git clone https://github.com/Chengsong-Huang/R-Zero.git
cd R-Zero
pip install -r requirements.txt
export STORAGE_PATH="/path/to/your/storage"
export HUGGINGFACENAME="yourhuggingfacename"
mkdir -p "$STORAGE_PATH/evaluation" "$STORAGE_PATH/models" "$STORAGE_PATH/generated_question" "$STORAGE_PATH/temp_results"
```
### 2.  Add API Keys
*   Insert your Hugging Face and WandB API keys into `tokens.json`.
*   Add your OpenAI GPT API key in `evaluation/results_recheck.py`.

### 3. Run Experiments
```bash
# Format: bash scripts/main.sh [Base_Model_Name] [Abbreviation]
# Example: bash scripts/main.sh Qwen/Qwen3-4B-Base qwen3-4b
```

## ‚ùì FAQ for Developers

**Q: What hardware setup is recommended for running experiments?**

**A:** The experiments were conducted on an 8-GPU server. Models that can run on a single GPU (e.g., 4B or 8B) were used.

**Q: What to do if environment configuration issues arise during installation?**

**A:** Consider consulting the setup instructions or Docker environment from [EasyR1](https://github.com/hiyouga/EasyR1/tree/main), as R-Zero is inspired by their work.

**Q: Where can I find training logs and model checkpoints?**

**A:** Logs, datasets, and model checkpoints are saved in the directory specified by the `STORAGE_PATH` environment variable. Datasets are also sent to Hugging Face via `HUGGINGFACENAME`.

**Q: What should I do if the code gets stuck during the questioner training process?**

**A:** This may be due to a bug in the `math_verify` library.  Restart training from the last saved checkpoint.
