# R-Zero: Self-Evolving Reasoning LLM from Zero Data

**R-Zero revolutionizes Large Language Models by enabling them to autonomously evolve their reasoning skills, requiring no initial data.** ([Original Repository](https://github.com/Chengsong-Huang/R-Zero))

## Key Features

*   **Fully Autonomous Learning:** Trains LLMs from scratch, eliminating the need for pre-existing datasets or human-labeled examples.
*   **Co-Evolutionary Architecture:** Leverages a dynamic "Challenger-Solver" loop to create a tailored, adaptive curriculum for continuous reasoning improvement.
*   **Performance Boosts:** Demonstrated significant performance gains across various reasoning benchmarks.
*   **Strong Generalization:** Reasoning abilities learned in specific domains translate effectively to broader reasoning tasks.
*   **Model Agnostic:**  R-Zero can enhance the reasoning capabilities of various base LLMs.

##  Overview

R-Zero is a groundbreaking framework that allows Large Language Models (LLMs) to enhance their reasoning abilities without any initial data. This self-evolving system initiates a co-evolutionary process between two instances of the same base model:

*   **Challenger:** This model identifies weaknesses in the Solver and generates progressively more challenging problems.
*   **Solver:** The Solverâ€™s mission is to refine its problem-solving skills by tackling the tasks generated by the Challenger.

This iterative "Challenger-Solver" dynamic constructs a custom, adaptive learning path. The Challenger learns to pose better questions, and the Solver becomes more skilled at finding optimal solutions. Key techniques like majority voting for pseudo-labels and relative policy optimization support the self-contained learning cycle.

##  Quickstart Guide

Get started with R-Zero by following these simple steps:

### 1. Configure Your Environment

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Chengsong-Huang/R-Zero.git
cd R-Zero
pip install -r requirements.txt
export STORAGE_PATH="/path/to/your/storage"  # Set your storage path
export HUGGINGFACENAME="yourhuggingfacename"
mkdir -p "$STORAGE_PATH/evaluation" "$STORAGE_PATH/models" "$STORAGE_PATH/generated_question" "$STORAGE_PATH/temp_results"
```

### 2. Add API Keys

Add the required API keys to `tokens.json` for Hugging Face and WandB (for logging), and your OpenAI GPT API key in `evaluation/results_recheck.py` for evaluation.

### 3. Run the Experiments

Replicate the experimental results with a single script:

```bash
#  bash scripts/main.sh [Base_Model_Name] [Abbreviation]
# Example:
bash scripts/main.sh Qwen/Qwen3-4B-Base qwen3-4b
```

##  Impressive Results

R-Zero consistently delivers significant performance improvements.

## Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ)

**Q: What hardware is needed for the experiments?**

**A:** The experiments were conducted on an 8-GPU server using models compatible with a single GPU (e.g., 4B or 8B). You might need to modify the code for larger models or different hardware configurations.

**Q: How can I address environment configuration issues?**

**A:** This framework's design is inspired by [EasyR1](https://github.com/hiyouga/EasyR1/tree/main). If you have any environment setup issues, consult their setup instructions or utilize their Docker environment.

**Q: Where can I find training logs and model checkpoints?**

**A:** All generated data, including logs, datasets, and model checkpoints, is saved in the directory defined by the `STORAGE_PATH` environment variable. Datasets will also be sent to Hugging Face via `HUGGINGFACENAME`.

**Q: What if the code gets stuck during questioner training?**

**A:** This could be due to a known issue with the `math_verify` lib, which can create an infinite loop. If you encounter this, restart training from the last checkpoint, as a timeout control has been added to help mitigate it.
