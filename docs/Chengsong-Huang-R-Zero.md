# R-Zero: Self-Evolving Reasoning LLM from Zero Data

**R-Zero empowers Large Language Models to learn and refine their reasoning skills autonomously, without any pre-existing datasets.**

[Check out the original repository](https://github.com/Chengsong-Huang/R-Zero) for more details.

## Key Features

*   **Autonomous Learning:** R-Zero starts with a base model and requires no external data or labeled examples.
*   **Co-Evolutionary Loop:** A "Challenger" model generates increasingly difficult problems, driving the "Solver" model to continuously improve.
*   **Enhanced Reasoning:**  R-Zero demonstrably boosts reasoning performance across various benchmarks.
*   **Generalization:** Reasoning skills learned in specific domains transfer effectively to general reasoning tasks.
*   **Model Agnostic:** R-Zero improves the performance of different LLM backbones.

## What's New

*   **2025-08-27:** Analysis of iteration scaling and a model taking on two roles added.
*   **2025-08-25:** Code updates for smoother training (via stopit).
*   **2025-08-08:** R-Zero was recognized as `#2 Paper of the day` on [Hugging Face Daily Paper](https://huggingface.co/papers/2508.05004).
*   **2025-08-07:** Paper and code released.

## Overview

R-Zero is a novel framework designed to enhance the reasoning abilities of LLMs through a self-evolving process. Unlike traditional methods that rely on extensive, curated datasets, R-Zero enables LLMs to learn and adapt autonomously, beginning with only a base model.

The core of R-Zero involves a dynamic co-evolutionary loop between two instances of the same base model:

*   **Challenger ðŸŽ¯:** This model probes the Solver for weaknesses by generating challenging problems.
*   **Solver ðŸ§ :** This model aims to continuously improve by solving the problems posed by the Challenger.

This interaction creates a targeted, adaptive curriculum. The Challenger learns to ask more effective questions, and the Solver learns to find better answers, all within a self-contained cycle using techniques like majority voting for pseudo-labels and relative policy optimization.

## Quickstart Guide

Get started with R-Zero in a few simple steps:

### 1. Configure Environment and Prepare Directories

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Chengsong-Huang/R-Zero.git

cd R-Zero

pip install -r requirements.txt

export STORAGE_PATH="/path/to/your/storage"
export HUGGINGFACENAME="yourhuggingfacename"

mkdir -p \
  "$STORAGE_PATH/evaluation" \
  "$STORAGE_PATH/models" \
  "$STORAGE_PATH/generated_question" \
  "$STORAGE_PATH/temp_results"
```

### 2. Add API Keys

You'll need to provide API keys for the following:

*   **Hugging Face** and **WandB** (for logging) in `tokens.json`.
*   **OpenAI GPT** (for evaluation) in `evaluation/results_recheck.py`.

### 3. Run the Experiments

Replicate the experimental results with a single script:

```bash
# Format: bash scripts/main.sh [Base_Model_Name] [Abbreviation]

# Example:
bash scripts/main.sh Qwen/Qwen3-4B-Base qwen3-4b
```

## FAQ for Developers

### Q: What are the hardware requirements?

**A:** Experiments were conducted on an 8-GPU server using models that can run on a single GPU (4B or 8B).  For larger models or different hardware, you may need to modify the code.

### Q: How to handle environment configuration issues?

**A:** This framework is inspired by [EasyR1](https://github.com/hiyouga/EasyR1/tree/main). Refer to their setup instructions or their Docker environment for troubleshooting.

### Q: Where are training logs and model checkpoints saved?

**A:** All generated data, including logs, datasets, and model checkpoints, will be saved in the `STORAGE_PATH` directory. Datasets will also be sent to Hugging Face via `HUGGINGFACENAME`.

### Q: What if the code gets stuck during training?

**A:** A timeout control mitigates potential infinite loops in the `math_verify` library. Restart training from the last checkpoint if this occurs.
