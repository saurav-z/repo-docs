## Overview

![](./figs/abstract.png)

R-Zero tackles the challenges of training reasoning models by eliminating the reliance on extensive, manually curated datasets. This innovative framework fosters self-improvement in LLMs, using a unique co-evolutionary loop to drive learning.

The core of R-Zero is a continuous interaction between two instances of the same base LLM:

1.  **Challenger:** This module probes the Solver, creating challenging problems designed to uncover its weaknesses.
2.  **Solver:** This module focuses on continuous improvement by solving the increasingly difficult tasks posed by the Challenger.

This process cultivates a highly effective, adaptive learning curriculum. The Challenger gets better at questioning, and the Solver gets better at answering. The system employs self-contained techniques like majority voting for pseudo-labels and relative policy optimization to guide the learning process.

## Quickstart Guide

Get started with R-Zero in a few simple steps:

### 1. Configure Environment & Prepare Directories

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Chengsong-Huang/R-Zero.git
cd R-Zero
pip install -r requirements.txt
export STORAGE_PATH="/path/to/your/storage"
export HUGGINGFACENAME="yourhuggingfacename"

mkdir -p \
  "$STORAGE_PATH/evaluation" \
  "$STORAGE_PATH/models" \
  "$STORAGE_PATH/generated_question" \
  "$STORAGE_PATH/temp_results"
```

### 2. Set Up API Keys

Add your API keys for the following services in the specified files:

*   **Hugging Face** and **WandB** (for logging) in `tokens.json`.
*   **OpenAI GPT** (for evaluation) in `evaluation/results_recheck.py`.

### 3. Run Experiments

Replicate our experimental results using the following script:

```bash
# Format: bash scripts/main.sh [Base_Model_Name] [Abbreviation]
# Example:
bash scripts/main.sh Qwen/Qwen3-4B-Base qwen3-4b
```

## FAQ for Developers

### Q: What hardware is required for experiments?

**A:** Experiments were conducted on an 8-GPU server using models that run on a single GPU (4B or 8B). Modifications may be required for larger models or different hardware.

### Q: What do I do if I encounter environment configuration issues?

**A:** The framework is inspired by [EasyR1](https://github.com/hiyouga/EasyR1/tree/main). Refer to their setup instructions or use their Docker environment as a guide.

### Q: Where are the training logs and checkpoints saved?

**A:**  All generated data, including logs, datasets, and checkpoints, are stored in the directory specified by the `STORAGE_PATH` environment variable. Datasets are also sent to Hugging Face via `HUGGINGFACENAME`.

### Q: What if the code gets stuck during the questioner training process?

**A:** A timeout control is in place to mitigate potential infinite loops from the `math_verify` library. Restart training from the last saved checkpoint if issues persist.
