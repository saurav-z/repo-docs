MemU achieves industry-leading performance:

![Memory Accuracy Comparison](assets/benchmark.png)
<em>(1) Single-hop questions require answers based on a single session; (2) Multi-hop questions require synthesizing information from multiple different sessions; (3) Temporal reasoning questions can be answered through temporal reasoning and capturing time-related data cues within the conversation; (4) Open-domain knowledge questions can be answered by integrating a speaker‚Äôs provided information with external knowledge such as commonsense or world facts; </em>

### Fast Retrieval

We categorize information into documents, eliminating the need for extensive embedding searches.

### Low Cost

Process hundreds of conversation turns at once to avoid wasting tokens. See [best practice](https://memu.pro/blog/memu-best-practice).
