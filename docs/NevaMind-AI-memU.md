*   **Link:**  Connections are created between related memories, building a rich network of hyperlinked documents.

*   **Evolve:**  Insights are generated by analyzing existing memories, identifying patterns, and creating summary documents.

*   **Never Forget:**  Information is prioritized based on usage, creating an information hierarchy that evolves with your needs.
