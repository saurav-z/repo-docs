    # Initialize
    memu_client = MemuClient(
        base_url="https://api.memu.so",
        api_key=os.getenv("MEMU_API_KEY") # Use os.getenv to securely fetch the API key
    )
    conversation_text = "Your long conversation string here..."  # Replace with actual conversation
    memu_client.memorize_conversation(
        conversation=conversation_text,  # Recommended: Long conversations (~8000 tokens); see best practice in blog
        user_id="user001",

## ‚ú® Core Concepts: Memory as a File System

MemU employs an innovative memory system:

*   **Organize:**  Autonomous Memory File Management - Your memories are structured as intelligent folders managed by a memory agent. The agent automatically decides what to record, modify, or archive.
*   **Link:** Interconnected Knowledge Graph - The system automatically creates connections between related memories, building a network of hyperlinked documents.
*   **Evolve:** Continuous Self-Improvement - Your memory agent generates new insights by analyzing existing memories, identifying patterns, and creating summary documents.
*   **Never Forget:** Adaptive Forgetting Mechanism - The memory agent prioritizes information based on usage patterns. Recently accessed memories remain highly accessible.

## üò∫ Advantages of MemU

*   **Higher Memory Accuracy:** MemU achieves 92.09% average accuracy in the Locomo dataset, significantly surpassing competitors. [Technical Report coming soon!]

    ![Memory Accuracy Comparison](assets/benchmark.png)

    _(1) Single-hop questions; (2) Multi-hop questions; (3) Temporal reasoning; (4) Open-domain knowledge._
*   **Fast Retrieval:** Efficiently locate relevant document content without extensive embedding searches.
*   **Low Cost:**  Process hundreds of conversation turns efficiently, reducing the need for repeated memory function calls.
