## ‚ú® Deep Dive: Memory as a File System

MemU reimagines memory as an intelligent file system:

*   **Organize: Autonomous Memory File Management** Your memories are structured as intelligent folders managed by a memory agent. The memory agent automatically decides what to record, modify, or archive.
*   **Link: Interconnected Knowledge Graph** The system automatically creates connections between related memories, building a rich network of hyperlinked documents and transforming memory discovery from search into effortless recall.
*   **Evolve: Continuous Self-Improvement** The memory agent generates new insights by analyzing existing memories, identifies patterns, and creates summary documents through self-reflection.
*   **Never Forget: Adaptive Forgetting Mechanism** The memory agent automatically prioritizes information based on usage patterns. Recently accessed memories remain highly accessible, while less relevant content is deprioritized or forgotten.
