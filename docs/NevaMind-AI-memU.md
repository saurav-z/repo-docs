### **Memory as File System**

#### **Organize** - Autonomous Memory File Management
Your memories are structured as intelligent folders managed by a memory agent. We do not do explicit modeling for memories. The memory agent automatically decides what to record, modify, or archive. Think of it as having a personal librarian who knows exactly how to organize your thoughts.

#### **Link** - Interconnected Knowledge Graph
Memories don't exist in isolation. Our system automatically creates meaningful connections between related memories, building a rich network of hyperlinked documents and transforming memory discovery from search into effortless recall.

#### **Evolve** - Continuous Self-Improvement
Even when offline, your memory agent keeps working. It generates new insights by analyzing existing memories, identifies patterns, and creates summary documents through self-reflection. Your knowledge base becomes smarter over time, not just larger.

#### **Never Forget** - Adaptive Forgetting Mechanism
The memory agent automatically prioritizes information based on usage patterns. Recently accessed memories remain highly accessible, while less relevant content is deprioritized or forgotten. This creates a personalized information hierarchy that evolves with your needs.
