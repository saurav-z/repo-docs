## Getting Started

### Basic Usage

```python
from dysts.flows import Lorenz

model = Lorenz()
sol = model.make_trajectory(1000)
# plt.plot(sol[:, 0], sol[:, 1])
```

### Modify Parameters

```python
model = Lorenz()
model.gamma = 1
model.ic = [0.1, 0.0, 5]
sol = model.make_trajectory(1000)
# plt.plot(sol[:, 0], sol[:, 1])
```

### Generate Trajectory Ensembles

```python
from dysts.systems import make_trajectory_ensemble

all_out = make_trajectory_ensemble(100, resample=True, pts_per_period=75)
```

### Load Precomputed Datasets

```python
from dysts.datasets import load_dataset

data = load_dataset(subsets="train", data_format="numpy", standardize=True)
```

## Installation

Install `dysts` from PyPI:

```bash
pip install dysts
```

## Contents

*   Code to generate benchmark forecasting and training experiments are included in  a separate [benchmarks repository](https://github.com/williamgilpin/dysts_data/tree/main/dysts_data/benchmarks)
*   Pre-computed time series with training and test partitions are included in [`data`](dysts/data/)
*   The raw definitions metadata for all chaotic systems are included in the database file [`chaotic_attractors`](dysts/data/chaotic_attractors.json). The Python implementations of differential equations can be found in [`the flows module`](dysts/flows.py)

## Additional Installation Guide

To obtain the latest version directly from GitHub:

```bash
pip install git+https://github.com/williamgilpin/dysts
```

To install the optional precomputed trajectories and benchmark results:

```bash
pip install git+https://github.com/williamgilpin/dysts_data
```

## Implementation Notes

*   The library features 135 continuous-time models, including delay differential equations and 10 discrete maps.
*   Dynamical equations are compiled using `numba` for performance.
*   Metadata is stored in parseable JSON files.
*   The integration timestep (`dt`) is chosen based on the highest significant frequency, and trajectories can be resampled for consistent timescales.

## Testing

Run tests using:

```bash
python -m unittest discover tests
```
