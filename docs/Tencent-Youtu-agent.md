# Youtu-agent: Build Powerful Agents with Open-Source Models

**Unleash the power of autonomous agents with Youtu-agent, a high-performance framework designed for building, running, and evaluating agents using open-source models.  [Explore the Youtu-agent Repository](https://github.com/Tencent/Youtu-agent)**

Youtu-agent empowers you to create sophisticated agents for data analysis, file processing, and in-depth research, all while leveraging the cost-effectiveness and flexibility of open-source models.

**Key Features:**

*   **Impressive Performance:** Achieves state-of-the-art results on benchmarks like WebWalkerQA (71.47%) and GAIA (72.8% text-only), demonstrating strong capabilities with open-source models.
*   **Open-Source & Cost-Effective:** Designed for accessible deployment, eliminating reliance on expensive closed-source models.
*   **Practical Use Cases:** Supports tasks like CSV analysis, literature review, personal file management, and more, with podcast and video generation coming soon.
*   **Flexible Architecture:** Built on the robust [openai-agents](https://github.com/openai/openai-agents-python), offering extensive support for diverse model APIs (DeepSeek, gpt-oss), tool integrations, and framework implementations.
*   **Streamlined Automation:** YAML-based configuration, automatic agent generation, and simplified setup minimize manual effort.

## Key Highlights:

*   **Verified Performance:** Achieved 71.47% on WebWalkerQA (pass@1) and 72.8% on GAIA (text-only subset, pass@1), using purely `DeepSeek-V3` series models (without Claude or GPT), establishing a strong open-source starting point.
*   **Open-source friendly & cost-aware**: Optimized for accessible, low-cost deployment without reliance on closed models.
*   **Practical use cases**: Out-of-the-box support for tasks like CSV analysis, literature review, personal file organization, and podcast and video generation (coming soon).
*   **Flexible architecture**: Built on [openai-agents](https://github.com/openai/openai-agents-python), with extensible support for diverse model APIs (form `DeepSeek` to `gpt-oss`), tool integrations, and framework implementations.
*   **Automation & simplicity**: YAML-based configs, auto agent generation, and streamlined setup reduce manual overhead.

## Performance

Youtu-agent demonstrates strong results on challenging deep search and tool use benchmarks, built upon open-source models and lightweight tools.

*   **WebWalkerQA:** Achieved 60.71% accuracy with `DeepSeek-V3-0324` and 71.47% with `DeepSeek-V3.1`.
*   **GAIA:** Achieved 72.8% pass@1 on the [text-only validation subset](https://github.com/sunnynexus/WebThinker/blob/main/data/GAIA/dev.json) using `DeepSeek-V3-0324`.

## Automatic Agent Generation

Youtu-agent simplifies agent creation with automatic configuration generation. Interact with a built-in "meta-agent" via YAML-based configurations to define your agent and generate config automatically.

**How it Works:**

1.  Clarify your requirements interactively.
2.  The system automatically generates the agent configuration.
3.  Run the generated configuration immediately.
