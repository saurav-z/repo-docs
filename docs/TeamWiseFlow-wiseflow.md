You can also use `install_pocketbase.sh` (for MacOS/Linux) or `install_pocketbase.ps1` (for Windows).

### 2.  Configure the .env File

Create a `.env` file in the Wiseflow project root directory by referring to `env_sample` and filling in your settings.

For version 4.x, you only need these parameters:

-   `LLM_API_KEY=""`
-   `LLM_API_BASE="https://api.siliconflow.cn/v1"`
-   `PRIMARY_MODEL=Qwen/Qwen3-14B`
-   `VL_MODEL=Pro/Qwen/Qwen2.5-VL-7B-Instruct`
