## üßê 'Wide Search' vs. 'Deep Search'

*   **Comprehensive Data Sources:** Access information from websites, social media (Weibo, Kuaishou), RSS feeds, and search engines.
*   **Smart HTML Processing:** Automatically extracts relevant information and identifies valuable links.
*   **User-Friendly Design:** No need for manual Xpaths ‚Äì it's ready to use.
*   **Continuous Improvement:** Expect high stability, availability, and efficient resource management.
*   **More Than Just a Crawler:** Wiseflow is designed to do more.
