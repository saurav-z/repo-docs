## Getting Started Quickly

**Follow these three steps to begin using Wiseflow:**

**Windows users should install the git bash tool first.  Follow the link to download [git bash](https://git-scm.com/downloads/win) then run the following commands in the bash terminal:**

### 1.  Clone the Repository & Install Dependencies

```bash
curl -LsSf https://astral.sh/uv/install.sh | sh
git clone https://github.com/TeamWiseFlow/wiseflow.git
```

This installs `uv`.

### 2.  Install PocketBase

Download PocketBase from the [PocketBase docs](https://pocketbase.io/docs/) and place it in the  `.pb/` directory of your project.

Alternatively, use `install_pocketbase.sh` (macOS/Linux) or `install_pocketbase.ps1` (Windows).

### 3. Configure the .env File

Create a `.env` file in the root directory of the project based on the `env_sample` file.  Fill in the necessary settings.  Minimum parameters required for 4.x:

```
LLM_API_KEY=""  # LLM service key (any OpenAI-compatible provider; omit if using a local Ollama deployment)
LLM_API_BASE="https://api.siliconflow.cn/v1" # LLM API endpoint (recommended: SiliconFlow; use my [referral link](https://cloud.siliconflow.cn/i/WNLYbBpi) for a bonus!)
PRIMARY_MODEL=Qwen/Qwen3-14B  # Recommended: Qwen3-14B or similar
VL_MODEL=Pro/Qwen/Qwen2.5-VL-7B-Instruct  # Recommended
```

### 4. Run Wiseflow

```bash
cd wiseflow
uv venv  #  Run only the first time
source .venv/bin/activate  # Linux/macOS
# OR on Windows:
# .venv\Scripts\activate
uv sync  # Run only the first time
python -m playwright install --with-deps chromium  # Run only the first time
chmod +x run.sh # Run only the first time
./run.sh
```

Refer to [docs/manual/manual.md](./docs/manual/manual.md) for detailed usage instructions.
