## Key Features

*   **AI-Driven Information Extraction:**  Leverage large language models (LLMs) to automatically extract relevant information from web pages, social media, and more.
*   **Customizable Search Sources:** Integrate with Bing, GitHub, arXiv, and other platforms to focus your searches.
*   **Contextual Analysis with AI:** Define roles and goals for the LLM to tailor analysis and extraction to your specific needs.
*   **Customizable Extraction Templates:**  Create custom forms to extract specific data points from web pages.
*   **Social Media Source Discovery:**  Identify content and creators on social platforms based on your focus points.
*   **Local Chrome Browser Integration:** Version 4.2 and later directly uses your local Chrome browser to enhance web scraping capabilities, bypass anti-bot measures, and support user logins for access to content requiring authentication.

## What's New in Version 4.2

*   **Enhanced Web Scraping:**  Improved web crawling by directly integrating with your local Chrome browser.
*   **Refactored Search Engine:** Includes new search engine options.
*   **Comprehensive Proxy Support:** Offers robust proxy solutions for reliable access.
*   **No Playwright Dependency:** Removes the need to install Playwright dependencies for deployment.
*   **More Stable and Reliable:**  Continuously improved for stability and availability.

For details, see the [CHANGELOG](CHANGELOG.md).

## LLM Recommendation

Based on extensive testing, the following models are recommended for optimal performance and cost-effectiveness:

*   **Performance-Focused:** `ByteDance-Seed/Seed-OSS-36B-Instruct`
*   **Cost-Effective:** `Qwen/Qwen3-14B`
*   **Visual Analysis:**  `Qwen/Qwen2.5-VL-7B-Instruct` (for visual analysis tasks)

Detailed test reports are available at [LLM USE TEST](./test/reports/README.md).

Wiseflow is compatible with OpenAI SDK-compatible LLM services, allowing you to use various providers such as Siliconflow, local Ollama deployments, or other options.

## Deep Search vs. Wide Search

Wiseflow is designed for "wide search" scenarios, offering a cost-effective solution for broad information gathering, such as industry intelligence or background checks.  It avoids the complexity and cost of "deep search" approaches when broad information gathering is needed.

## Getting Started

**Follow these three steps to start using Wiseflow:**

**Important:**  Starting with version 4.2, you must have Google Chrome installed on your system (using the default installation path).

### 1.  Clone the Repository and Install Dependencies

```bash
curl -LsSf https://astral.sh/uv/install.sh | sh
git clone https://github.com/TeamWiseFlow/wiseflow.git
```

### 2. Install PocketBase

Download the appropriate PocketBase binary from [PocketBase docs](https://pocketbase.io/docs/) and place it in the `.pb` folder. You can also try to use:

* install\_pocketbase.sh (for MacOS/Linux)
* install\_pocketbase.ps1 (for Windows) to install.

### 3. Configure the Environment

Create a `.env` file in the root directory of the project (based on `env_sample`) and configure the following parameters:

*   `LLM_API_KEY=""` (Your LLM service API key.  Leave blank if using a local Ollama deployment.)
*   `LLM_API_BASE="https://api.siliconflow.cn/v1"` (LLM API endpoint. Recommended: Siliconflow.  See the original repo for a referral link.)
*   `PRIMARY_MODEL=ByteDance-Seed/Seed-OSS-36B-Instruct` (The primary LLM model to be used.)
*   `VL_MODEL=Pro/Qwen/Qwen2.5-VL-7B-Instruct` (Visual LLM model.)

### 4. Run Wiseflow

```bash
cd wiseflow
uv venv # Run this command only the first time
source .venv/bin/activate  # Linux/macOS
# Or on Windows:
# .venv\Scripts\activate
uv sync # Run this command only the first time
chmod +x run.sh # Run this command only the first time
./run.sh
```

## Integrating Data

All scraped data is stored in PocketBase, so you can directly access it through the database using a Go/Javascript/Python SDK.
