# Wiseflow: Your AI Chief Intelligence Officer

**Tired of drowning in information?** Wiseflow is an AI-powered tool designed to extract and deliver the most relevant information from a vast sea of sources, saving you time and uncovering valuable insights. ([Original Repository](https://github.com/TeamWiseFlow/wiseflow))

**Key Features:**

*   **Comprehensive Information Gathering:** Collects data from a variety of sources, including web pages, social media platforms (Weibo, Kuaishou), RSS feeds, and search engines (Bing, GitHub, Arxiv, eBay).
*   **AI-Driven Information Filtering:** Uses large language models (LLMs) to filter noise and highlight valuable information based on your specific interests.
*   **Customizable Search Sources:** Choose from a selection of search engines for focused information gathering.
*   **Role-Based Analysis:** Instructs LLMs to analyze information from a specific perspective or for a particular purpose.
*   **Custom Extraction Modes:** Create custom forms within the PocketBase interface to extract specific data fields.
*   **Social Media Creator Discovery:** Identifies content creators related to your focus points on social media.
*   **90% Discount on OpenAI Models:** Enjoy discounted access to OpenAI models through the AiHubMix service (requires switching to the aihubmix branch).

## What Makes Wiseflow Different?

*   **Broad Search Focus:** Designed for "wide search" scenarios, where you need to gather a wide range of information rather than a deep dive into a specific query.
*   **User-Friendly:** Operates without requiring manual Xpath inputs, making it accessible to users without coding expertise.
*   **Adaptive Processing:** Employs a unique HTML processing flow optimized for information extraction.
*   **Stable and Efficient:** Continuously updated for high stability and performance, while being efficient with system resources.

## Getting Started Quickly

**Follow these simple steps to get started:**

**Prerequisites:**

*   Windows users, download and install Git Bash: [Git Bash Download](https://git-scm.com/downloads/win)

### 1. Clone the Repository & Install Dependencies

```bash
curl -LsSf https://astral.sh/uv/install.sh | sh
git clone https://github.com/TeamWiseFlow/wiseflow.git
```

### 2. Download PocketBase

Download the PocketBase application for your operating system from the [PocketBase Docs](https://pocketbase.io/docs/) and place it in the `.pb/` folder.

*Alternatively*, use the provided scripts (install\_pocketbase.sh for MacOS/Linux or install\_pocketbase.ps1 for Windows) to install PocketBase.

### 3. Configure the .env File

Create a `.env` file in the project's root directory using `env_sample` as a template, and fill in the required settings:

*   `LLM_API_KEY=""` (Your LLM service API key.  Use a service that provides OpenAI-compatible API, or leave blank if deploying locally with Ollama.)
*   `LLM_API_BASE="https://api.siliconflow.cn/v1"` (LLM API endpoint.  Consider using SiliconFlow, and use this [referral link](https://cloud.siliconflow.cn/i/WNLYbBpi) for a sign-up bonus!)
*   `PRIMARY_MODEL=Qwen/Qwen3-14B` (Recommended LLM model)
*   `VL_MODEL=Pro/Qwen/Qwen2.5-VL-7B-Instruct` (Recommended Visual Language Model)

### 4. Run Wiseflow
