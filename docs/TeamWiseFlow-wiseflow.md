## ðŸš€ Getting Started

Follow these simple steps to get started with Wiseflow!

**Important:**  Starting with version 4.2, you *must* have Google Chrome installed (using the default installation path).

### 1.  Clone the Repository & Install Dependencies

```bash
curl -LsSf https://astral.sh/uv/install.sh | sh
git clone https://github.com/TeamWiseFlow/wiseflow.git
```

After cloning, you'll need to install the PocketBase application. Download the appropriate version for your operating system from the [PocketBase docs](https://pocketbase.io/docs/) and place it in the `.pb` directory.  Alternatively, you can try using the provided `install_pocketbase.sh` (MacOS/Linux) or `install_pocketbase.ps1` (Windows) scripts.

### 2.  Configure the Environment

Create a `.env` file in the project's root directory, using `env_sample` as a guide.  At a minimum, you'll need to configure:

*   `LLM_API_KEY`:  Your API key for the LLM service.
*   `LLM_API_BASE`: The base URL for your LLM API. (Siliconflow is recommended)
*   `PRIMARY_MODEL`: The primary LLM model to use.
*   `VL_MODEL`: An optional visual analysis model.

### 3.  Run Wiseflow

cd wiseflow
uv venv # First time only
