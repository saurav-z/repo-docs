## üßê **Wide Search vs. Deep Search**

Wiseflow is designed for **"wide search"**, focusing on broad information gathering.  It's the ideal tool for industry intelligence, background checks, and lead generation, offering a more efficient approach than resource-intensive "deep search" methods.

## ‚úã **What Makes Wiseflow Different?**

*   **Comprehensive Data Sources:** Access web pages, social media (Weibo, Kuaishou), RSS feeds, and search engines (Bing, GitHub, ArXiv, eBay).
*   **Smart HTML Processing:** Automatically extracts key information and identifies valuable links, powered by a 14B parameter model.
*   **User-Friendly Design:** No need for manual XPath configuration; "out-of-the-box" functionality for easy use.
*   **Ongoing Development:** Expect continuous improvements and stability, with a focus on efficient resource management.
*   **Future-Proof:** The product will evolve beyond a simple crawler.
