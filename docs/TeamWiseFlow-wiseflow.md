## üåü Quick Start Guide

**Follow these three simple steps to get started!**

**Windows users:**  Download and install Git Bash before proceeding.  [Git Bash Download](https://git-scm.com/downloads/win)

### üìã Clone the Repository & Install Dependencies

```bash
curl -LsSf https://astral.sh/uv/install.sh | sh
git clone https://github.com/TeamWiseFlow/wiseflow.git
```

This will install `uv`.

Next, download the correct PocketBase executable for your system from [PocketBase Docs](https://pocketbase.io/docs/) and place it in the `.pb/` folder.
Alternatively, try running install_pocketbase.sh (for MacOS/Linux) or install_pocketbase.ps1 (for Windows) to install it.

### üì• Configure Your Environment

Create a `.env` file in the project root directory based on the `env_sample` file and fill in your settings.  The minimum configuration requires:

*   `LLM_API_KEY=""` (Your LLM service API key - any OpenAI-compatible service works)
*   `LLM_API_BASE="https://api.siliconflow.cn/v1"` (Your LLM service API endpoint - SiliconFlow is recommended.  Use my [referral link](https://cloud.siliconflow.cn/i/WNLYbBpi) for a bonus!)
*   `PRIMARY_MODEL=Qwen/Qwen3-14B` (Recommended: Qwen3-14B or similar-sized model)
*   `VL_MODEL=Pro/Qwen/Qwen2.5-VL-7B-Instruct` (Recommended, but optional)

### üöÄ Run Wiseflow

```bash
cd wiseflow
uv venv # Run only the first time
source .venv/bin/activate  # Linux/macOS
# Or on Windows:
# .venv\Scripts\activate
uv sync # Run only the first time
python -m playwright install --with-deps chromium # Run only the first time
chmod +x run.sh # Run only the first time
./run.sh
```

For detailed instructions, see [docs/manual/manual.md](./docs/manual/manual.md).

## üìö Integrating with Your Applications

Wiseflow saves all scraped data in Pocketbase.  Use Pocketbase SDKs (Go/Javascript/Python and more) to access and utilize the data in your own projects.
