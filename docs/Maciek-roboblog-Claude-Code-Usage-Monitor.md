```

For first-time `uv` users:

```bash
# On Linux/macOS:
curl -LsSf https://astral.sh/uv/install.sh | sh

# On Windows:
powershell -ExecutionPolicy ByPass -c "irm https://astral.sh/uv/install.ps1 | iex"

# After installation, restart your terminal
```

### üì¶ Installation with `pip`

```bash
# Install from PyPI
pip install claude-monitor

# If claude-monitor command is not found, add ~/.local/bin to PATH:
echo 'export PATH="$HOME/.local/bin:$PATH"' >> ~/.bashrc
source ~/.bashrc  # or restart your terminal

# Run:
claude-monitor  # or cmonitor, ccmonitor, ccm
```
