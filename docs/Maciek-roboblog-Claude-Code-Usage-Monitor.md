## Installation

Choose the installation method that suits your needs.  **uv is the recommended and easiest method.**

### ‚ö° Modern Installation with uv (Recommended)

uv is a fast and modern package and dependency manager.

```bash
# Install uv if you don't have it:
# On Linux/macOS:
curl -LsSf https://astral.sh/uv/install.sh | sh
# On Windows:
powershell -ExecutionPolicy ByPass -c "irm https://astral.sh/uv/install.ps1 | iex"

# Install the monitor:
uv tool install claude-monitor

# Run from anywhere
claude-monitor  # or cmonitor, ccmonitor for short
```

### üì¶ Installation with pip

```bash
pip install claude-monitor

# If claude-monitor command is not found, add ~/.local/bin to PATH (as described above):
echo 'export PATH="$HOME/.local/bin:$PATH"' >> ~/.bashrc
source ~/.bashrc  # or restart your terminal

# Run from anywhere
claude-monitor  # or cmonitor, ccmonitor for short
```

### üõ†Ô∏è Other Package Managers

*   **pipx**: `pipx install claude-monitor`
*   **conda/mamba**: `pip install claude-monitor` within your conda environment.

## Usage

### Basic Usage

```bash
# Run with default settings (Custom plan, real-time view)
claude-monitor
```

*   Press `Ctrl+C` to gracefully exit.

### Configuration Options

Customize your monitoring experience with a variety of options, saved automatically:

*   **`--plan`**: Choose your Claude plan (`pro`, `max5`, `max20`, `custom`).  `custom` is the default.
*   **`--custom-limit-tokens`**: Set a custom token limit (for the custom plan).
*   **`--view`**: Select the view type (`realtime`, `daily`, `monthly`).
*   **`--timezone`**: Specify your timezone (e.g., `America/New_York`, `UTC`, `auto`).
*   **`--time-format`**: Set your preferred time format (e.g., `12h`, `24h`, `auto`).
*   **`--theme`**:  Choose your theme (`light`, `dark`, `classic`, `auto`).
*   **`--refresh-rate`**: Set the data refresh rate in seconds (1-60).
*   **`--refresh-per-second`**: Adjust the display refresh rate (0.1-20.0 Hz).
*   **`--reset-hour`**: Set the daily reset hour (0-23).
*   **`--log-level`**: Set logging level (`DEBUG`, `INFO`, `WARNING`, `ERROR`, `CRITICAL`).
*   **`--log-file`**: Specify a log file path.
*   **`--debug`**: Enable debug logging.
*   **`--clear`**: Clear saved configuration.
