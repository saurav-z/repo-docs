## Understanding How It Works

The Claude Code Usage Monitor is built with a modular design which is split up into three layers:

*   **üñ•Ô∏è User Interface Layer**: Handles CLI, Settings, Errors, and Rich Terminal UI
*   **üéõÔ∏è Monitoring Orchestrator**: Manages central control, data flow, and analytics
*   **üèóÔ∏è Foundation Layer**: Contains Core Models, Analysis Engine, and Terminal Themes

**Data Flow:** Claude Config Files ‚Üí Data Layer ‚Üí Analysis Engine ‚Üí UI Components ‚Üí Terminal Display

### Key Features:

- Configurable update intervals with high-precision display refresh
- Multi-threaded orchestration with callback system
- Progress Bars and Data Tables
- Intelligent auto-detection terminal themes
