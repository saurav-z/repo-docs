## üì¶ Installation

Choose your preferred installation method:

*   **Recommended: Modern Installation with `uv`**

    *   **Why `uv`?** Isolates environments, avoids Python version issues, simplifies updates.
    *   ```bash
        # Install with uv
        uv tool install claude-monitor
        # Run from anywhere
        claude-monitor  # or cmonitor, ccmonitor for short
        ```
        *   Install `uv` first, if you don't have it: `curl -LsSf https://astral.sh/uv/install.sh | sh` (Linux/macOS) or `powershell -ExecutionPolicy ByPass -c "irm https://astral.sh/uv/install.ps1 | iex"` (Windows)

*   **Installation with `pip`**

    ```bash
    pip install claude-monitor
    # If command not found, add to PATH: export PATH="$HOME/.local/bin:$PATH"
    claude-monitor  # or cmonitor, ccmonitor for short
    ```
        *   **Important:** Consider using a virtual environment or `pipx` to manage dependencies (especially for "externally-managed-environment" errors).

*   **Alternative Package Managers**

    *   `pipx`: `pipx install claude-monitor`
    *   `conda/mamba`: `pip install claude-monitor` within your conda environment.
