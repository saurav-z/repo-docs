## üöÄ Installation

### ‚ö° Modern Installation with `uv` (Recommended)

`uv` is a fast and reliable package manager that simplifies installation and eliminates potential conflicts.

```bash
# Install uv (if you don't have it)
curl -LsSf https://astral.sh/uv/install.sh | sh  # Linux/macOS
powershell -ExecutionPolicy ByPass -c "irm https://astral.sh/uv/install.ps1 | iex" # Windows

# Install claude-monitor
uv tool install claude-monitor

# Run the monitor
claude-monitor  # or cmonitor, ccmonitor, ccm
```

### üì¶ Installation with `pip`

```bash
pip install claude-monitor

# If claude-monitor command not found, add to PATH
# (add to ~/.bashrc or ~/.zshrc)
echo 'export PATH="$HOME/.local/bin:$PATH"' >> ~/.bashrc && source ~/.bashrc

# Run the monitor
claude-monitor  # or cmonitor, ccmonitor, ccm
```

### üõ†Ô∏è Alternative Installation Methods

*   **pipx:** `pipx install claude-monitor`
*   **conda/mamba:** `pip install claude-monitor` (within your conda environment)
