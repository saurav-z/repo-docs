# Apache TVM: The Open Deep Learning Compiler Stack

**Apache TVM empowers developers to optimize deep learning models for various hardware platforms, bridging the gap between framework flexibility and hardware performance.**

[**See the original repository on GitHub**](https://github.com/apache/tvm)

**Key Features:**

*   **End-to-End Compilation:** Compiles deep learning models from various frameworks for diverse hardware backends.
*   **Cross-Level Optimization:** Enables joint optimization of computational graphs, tensor programs, and libraries.
*   **Python-First Transformation:**  Allows customization of most transformations in Python, increasing accessibility.
*   **TensorIR and Relax:** Uses TensorIR for tensor-level representation and Relax for graph-level representation.
*   **Foundation for Vertical Compilers:** Provides infrastructure for building domain-specific compilers (e.g., LLMs).

## What is Apache TVM?

Apache TVM is a powerful, open-source compiler stack designed to optimize deep learning models for various hardware architectures. It acts as a bridge, allowing deep learning frameworks to achieve optimal performance on diverse hardware backends.  TVM helps improve efficiency and performance of your models across various hardware platforms.
