## Installation

### Automatic Installation (Recommended)

1.  Navigate to your ComfyUI custom nodes directory:

    ```bash
    cd ComfyUI/custom_nodes
    ```

2.  Clone the repository:

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/Enemyx-net/VibeVoice-ComfyUI
    ```

3.  Restart ComfyUI. The necessary dependencies will be automatically installed upon first use of the nodes.

## Available Nodes

### 1. VibeVoice Load Text From File

*   **Description:** Loads text content from .txt files.
*   **Input:** File path (from ComfyUI's input/output/temp directories).
*   **Output:** Text string.

### 2. VibeVoice Single Speaker

*   **Description:** Generates speech using a single voice.
*   **Inputs:**
    *   `text`: Input text (direct or from "Load Text" node).
    *   `model`: VibeVoice-1.5B or VibeVoice-Large.
    *   `voice_to_clone` (Optional): Audio input for voice cloning.
    *   Other parameters for fine-tuning (seed, cfg_scale, temperature, etc.)
*   **Outputs:** Audio

### 3. VibeVoice Multiple Speakers

*   **Description:** Generates multi-speaker conversations.
*   **Speaker Format:** Use `[N]:` notation (N = 1-4) in your text.
*   **Inputs:**
    *   `text`: Input text with speaker labels.
    *   `model`: VibeVoice-1.5B or VibeVoice-Large.
    *   `speaker1_voice` to `speaker4_voice` (Optional): Audio inputs for voice cloning.
    *   Other parameters for fine-tuning (seed, cfg_scale, temperature, etc.)
*   **Outputs:** Audio

### 4. VibeVoice Free Memory

*   **Description:** Frees loaded VibeVoice models from memory. Useful for managing VRAM in complex workflows.
*   **Input:** `audio` (Connect audio output to trigger cleanup).
*   **Output:** `audio` (passes through the input audio).

## Multi-Speaker Text Formatting

Format your text for multi-speaker generation using the following notation:

```
[1]: Hello, how are you today?
[2]: I'm doing great, thanks for asking!
```

*   Use `[1]:`, `[2]:`, `[3]:`, and `[4]:` to label speakers (max 4).
*   The system automatically detects the number of speakers.
*   Optional voice samples for each speaker can be used for cloning.

## Model Information

### VibeVoice-1.5B

*   **Size:** ~5GB download
*   **Speed:** Faster inference.
*   **Quality:** Good for single-speaker tasks.
*   **Use Case:** Quick prototyping and single-voice applications.

### VibeVoice-Large

*   **Size:** ~17GB download
*   **Speed:** Optimized for performance.
*   **Quality:** Highest quality audio.
*   **Use Case:** Production-quality output and multi-speaker conversations.

*Models are downloaded on first use to the `ComfyUI/models/vibevoice/` directory.*

## Generation Modes

### Deterministic Mode (Default)

*   `use_sampling = False`
*   Produces consistent and stable results.
*   Recommended for production environments.

### Sampling Mode

*   `use_sampling = True`
*   Offers more variation in output.
*   Utilizes temperature and top\_p parameters.
*   Ideal for creative exploration.

## Voice Cloning

To clone a voice, connect an audio node:

1.  To the `voice_to_clone` input (Single Speaker node).
2.  Or, to the `speaker1_voice`, `speaker2_voice`, etc. inputs (Multi-Speaker node).

**Voice Sample Requirements:**

*   Clear audio, minimal background noise.
*   Minimum 3-10 seconds, 30 seconds recommended.
*   Automatically resampled to 24kHz.

## Tips for Best Results

1.  **Text Preparation:** Use correct punctuation, break long texts into paragraphs, and clearly define speaker transitions in multi-speaker mode.
2.  **Model Selection:** Choose 1.5B for speed and single-speaker tasks, and Large for high-quality results.
3.  **Seed Management:** Save effective seeds for consistent voice characteristics and try random seeds for variability.
4.  **Performance:** Remember that models are downloaded the first time. Use a GPU for faster processing.

## System Requirements

*   **Hardware:**
    *   Minimum: 8GB VRAM (VibeVoice-1.5B).
    *   Recommended: 17GB+ VRAM (VibeVoice-Large).
    *   RAM: 16GB+ system memory.
*   **Software:**
    *   Python 3.8+.
    *   PyTorch 2.0+.
    *   CUDA 11.8+ (for GPU acceleration).
    *   Transformers 4.51.3+.
    *   ComfyUI (latest version).

## Troubleshooting

*   **Installation Issues:** Ensure you are in the ComfyUI's Python environment, try manual installation, and restart ComfyUI.
*   **Generation Issues:** Test deterministic mode, check text formatting in multi-speaker mode, and ensure speaker numbers are sequential (1, 2, 3).
*   **Memory Issues:** Use the correct model for the available VRAM and utilize the Free Memory Node.
