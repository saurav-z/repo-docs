*   ‚öôÔ∏è **Customizable Parameters:** Control temperature, sampling, and guidance scale for unique results.
*   üíæ **Optimized Performance:** Benefit from adjustable diffusion steps, memory management tools, and Apple Silicon support for speed and efficiency.
*   üîå **Node Chaining:** Easily connect nodes together for complex workflows.
*   ‚ú® **Pause Tag Support:** Enhance your speech pacing with custom `[pause]` tags.

## Installation

### Automatic Installation (Recommended)

1.  Navigate to your ComfyUI custom nodes directory:
    ```bash
    cd ComfyUI/custom_nodes
    ```

2.  Clone the repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/Enemyx-net/VibeVoice-ComfyUI
    ```

## Core Nodes Overview

### 1. VibeVoice Load Text From File

*   **Function:** Loads text from `.txt` files.
*   **Output:** Text string ready for TTS nodes.

### 2. VibeVoice Single Speaker

*   **Function:** Generates speech from single-speaker text.
*   **Inputs:** Text, Model Selection, Optional Voice Cloning
*   **Parameters:** Control steps, temperature, seed, guidance and memory usage.

### 3. VibeVoice Multiple Speakers

*   **Function:** Creates multi-speaker conversations.
*   **Format:** Use `[N]:` notation for each speaker (up to 4).
*   **Inputs:** Text with speaker labels, optional voice samples, model selection.
*   **Parameters:** Similar to Single Speaker, tailored for conversations.

### 4. VibeVoice Free Memory

*   **Function:** Manually releases VibeVoice models from memory.
*   **Usage:** Connect to audio output to trigger memory cleanup.

## Multi-Speaker Text Format

Format your text for multi-speaker generation using this notation:

```
[1]: Hello, how are you today?
[2]: I'm doing great, thanks for asking!
```

## Model Information

*   **VibeVoice-1.5B:** Fast, great for single speakers.
*   **VibeVoice-Large:** Top quality, best for multi-speaker.
*   **VibeVoice-Large-Quant-4Bit:** Good quality, lower VRAM usage.

## Generation Modes

*   **Deterministic:** (Default) Consistent output (`use_sampling = False`).
*   **Sampling:** Variable output with `temperature` and `top_p` (`use_sampling = True`).

## Voice Cloning

1.  Connect an audio node to `voice_to_clone` (single speaker) or `speaker1_voice`, `speaker2_voice`, etc. (multi-speaker).
2.  Provide clear audio (min. 3-10 seconds, recommended at least 30 seconds) with minimal noise.

## Pause Tags Support

*   Use `[pause]` (1-second silence) or `[pause:ms]` (custom duration in milliseconds).
*   **Important:** Pauses may affect context understanding; use them judiciously.

## Tips for Best Results

1.  Prepare text with punctuation and breaks.
2.  Choose the right model for your needs.
3.  Manage seeds for consistent voices.
4.  Optimize performance (GPU recommended).

## System Requirements

*   **Minimum:** 8GB VRAM.
*   **Recommended:** 16GB+ system RAM, 17GB+ VRAM.
*   **Software:** Python 3.8+, PyTorch 2.0+, CUDA 11.8+ (for GPU), Transformers 4.51.3+, ComfyUI.

## Troubleshooting

*   Check ComfyUI logs and follow the troubleshooting steps from the original repo.
