*   üöÄ **Quickstart Examples:**

    ```python
    # Forecasting
    from sktime.datasets import load_airline
    from sktime.forecasting.base import ForecastingHorizon
    from sktime.forecasting.theta import ThetaForecaster
    from sktime.split import temporal_train_test_split
    from sktime.performance_metrics.forecasting import mean_absolute_percentage_error

    y = load_airline()
    y_train, y_test = temporal_train_test_split(y)
    fh = ForecastingHorizon(y_test.index, is_relative=False)
    forecaster = ThetaForecaster(sp=12)  # monthly seasonal periodicity
    forecaster.fit(y_train)
    y_pred = forecaster.predict(fh)
    mean_absolute_percentage_error(y_test, y_pred)
    >>> 0.08661467738190656

    # Time Series Classification
    from sktime.classification.interval_based import TimeSeriesForestClassifier
    from sktime.datasets import load_arrow_head
    from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split
    from sklearn.metrics import accuracy_score

    X, y = load_arrow_head()
    X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X, y)
    classifier = TimeSeriesForestClassifier()
    classifier.fit(X_train, y_train)
    y_pred = classifier.predict(X_test)
    accuracy_score(y_test, y_pred)
    >>> 0.8679245283018868
