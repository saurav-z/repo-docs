### pip

```bash
pip install sktime
```

or install all dependencies

```bash
pip install sktime[all_extras]
```

### conda

## Quickstart Examples

### Forecasting

```python
from sktime.datasets import load_airline
from sktime.forecasting.base import ForecastingHorizon
from sktime.forecasting.theta import ThetaForecaster
from sktime.split import temporal_train_test_split
from sktime.performance_metrics.forecasting import mean_absolute_percentage_error

y = load_airline()
y_train, y_test = temporal_train_test_split(y)
fh = ForecastingHorizon(y_test.index, is_relative=False)
forecaster = ThetaForecaster(sp=12)  # monthly seasonal periodicity
forecaster.fit(y_train)
y_pred = forecaster.predict(fh)
mean_absolute_percentage_error(y_test, y_pred)
>>> 0.08661467738190656
```

### Time Series Classification

```python
from sktime.classification.interval_based import TimeSeriesForestClassifier
from sktime.datasets import load_arrow_head
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split
from sklearn.metrics import accuracy_score

X, y = load_arrow_head()
X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X, y)
classifier = TimeSeriesForestClassifier()
classifier.fit(X_train, y_train)
y_pred = classifier.predict(X_test)
accuracy_score(y_test, y_pred)
>>> 0.8679245283018868
```
