vLLM CLI provides a powerful and user-friendly command-line interface to serve and manage LLMs using vLLM, offering both interactive and command-line modes. It simplifies model deployment with features like model management, server monitoring, and configurable profiles.

*Interactive terminal interface with GPU status and system overview*<br>
*Tip: You can customize the GPU stats bar in settings*

## Key Features

*   **Interactive Mode:** Navigate and manage your LLMs through a rich, menu-driven terminal interface.
*   **Command-Line Mode:** Automate and script your LLM workflows with direct CLI commands.
*   **Model Management:** Easily discover and load local models, including support for Hugging Face and Ollama.
*   **Configuration Profiles:** Utilize pre-configured profiles or create custom server settings tailored to your needs.
*   **Server Monitoring:** Monitor the status and performance of your vLLM servers in real-time.
*   **System Information:** Get comprehensive system information, including GPU, memory, and CUDA compatibility checks.
*   **Advanced Configuration:** Fine-tune vLLM parameters for optimal performance and control.
*   **Multi-Model Proxy (Experimental):** Serve multiple models through a single API endpoint (experimental).

## What's New

### Multi-Model Proxy Server (Experimental)

*   **Single Endpoint:** Access all your models through one unified API.
*   **Live Management:** Add or remove models without stopping the service.
*   **Dynamic GPU Management:** Efficient GPU resource allocation through vLLM's sleep/wake functionality.
*   **Interactive Setup:** User-friendly wizard for easy configuration.

### Hardware-Optimized Profiles for GPT-OSS Models
New built-in profiles specifically optimized for serving GPT-OSS models on different GPU architectures:
- **`gpt_oss_ampere`** - Optimized for NVIDIA A100 GPUs
- **`gpt_oss_hopper`** - Optimized for NVIDIA H100/H200 GPUs
- **`gpt_oss_blackwell`** - Optimized for NVIDIA Blackwell GPUs

### ‚ö° Shortcuts System
Save and quickly launch your favorite model + profile combinations:
```bash
vllm-cli serve --shortcut my-gpt-server
```

### ü¶ô Full Ollama Integration
- Automatic discovery of Ollama models
- GGUF format support (experimental)
- System and user directory scanning

### üîß Enhanced Configuration
- **Environment Variables** - Universal and profile-specific environment variable management
- **GPU Selection** - Choose specific GPUs for model serving (`--device 0,1`)
- **Enhanced System Info** - vLLM feature detection with attention backend availability

## Quick Start

### Important: vLLM Installation Notes
‚ö†Ô∏è **Binary Compatibility Warning**: vLLM contains pre-compiled CUDA kernels that must match your PyTorch version exactly. Installing mismatched versions will cause errors.

vLLM-CLI will not install vLLM or Pytorch by default.

### Installation

#### Option 1: Install vLLM seperately and then install vLLM CLI (Recommended)
```bash
# Install vLLM -- Skip this step if you have vllm installed in your environment
uv venv --python 3.12 --seed
source .venv/bin/activate
uv pip install vllm --torch-backend=auto
# Or specify a backend: uv pip install vllm --torch-backend=cu128

# Install vLLM CLI
uv pip install --upgrade vllm-cli
uv run vllm-cli

# If you are using conda:
# Activate the environment you have vllm installed in
pip install vllm-cli
vllm-cli
```
#### Option 2: Install vLLM CLI + vLLM

```bash
# Install vLLM CLI + vLLM
pip install vllm-cli[vllm]
vllm-cli
```

#### Option 3: Build from source (You still need to install vLLM seperately)
```bash
git clone https://github.com/Chen-zexi/vllm-cli.git
cd vllm-cli
pip install -e .
```

#### Option 4: For Isolated Installation (pipx/system packages)

‚ö†Ô∏è **Compatibility Note:** pipx creates isolated environments which may have compatibility issues with vLLM's CUDA dependencies. Consider using uv or conda (see above) for better PyTorch/CUDA compatibility.

```bash
# If you do not want to use virtual environment and want to install vLLM along with vLLM CLI
pipx install "vllm-cli[vllm]"

# If you want to install pre-release version
pipx install --pip-args="--pre" "vllm-cli[vllm]"
```

### Prerequisites

*   Python 3.9+
*   CUDA-compatible GPU (recommended)
*   vLLM package installed
*   For dependency issues, see [Troubleshooting Guide](docs/troubleshooting.md#dependency-conflicts)

### Basic Usage

```bash
# Interactive mode - menu-driven interface
vllm-cl
# Serve a model
vllm-cli serve --model openai/gpt-oss-20b

# Use a shortcut
vllm-cli serve --shortcut my-model
```

## Configuration

### Built-in Profiles

vLLM CLI provides a set of optimized profiles for various use cases:

**General Purpose:**

*   `standard`: Minimal configuration with smart defaults.
*   `high_throughput`: Optimized for maximum performance.
