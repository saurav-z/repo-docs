## Key Features

*   **Simulate Quantum Systems:** Efficiently model a wide range of quantum mechanical problems.
*   **Time-Dependent Simulations:** Handles Hamiltonians and collapse operators with arbitrary time-dependence.
*   **Open and Closed Systems:** Supports simulations of both closed and open quantum systems.
*   **Python-Based:** Leverages the power of Python with NumPy, SciPy, and Cython for numerical backends, and Matplotlib for graphical output.
*   **Open Source:**  Freely available for use and modification under a New BSD license.
*   **User-Friendly and Efficient:** Designed for both research and educational purposes.
