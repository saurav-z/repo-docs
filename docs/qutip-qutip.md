## Key Features:

*   **Numerical Simulation:** Efficiently simulate a wide range of quantum mechanical problems.
*   **Time-Dependent Hamiltonians:** Handle Hamiltonians and collapse operators with arbitrary time-dependence.
*   **Open & Closed Quantum Systems:** Model the dynamics of both closed and open quantum systems.
*   **Python-Based:** Utilizes the power of Python, with Numpy, Scipy, and Cython backends.
*   **Visualization:** Provides graphical output via Matplotlib.
*   **Open Source:** Free to use, modify, and distribute under a New BSD license.
