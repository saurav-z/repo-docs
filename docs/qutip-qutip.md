# QuTiP: Quantum Toolbox in Python

**QuTiP is an open-source software for simulating the dynamics of closed and open quantum systems, providing a powerful and user-friendly platform for quantum mechanics research and education.** ([Original Repo](https://github.com/qutip/qutip))

## Key Features

*   **Simulate Quantum Systems:** Model and simulate the behavior of both closed and open quantum systems.
*   **Time-Dependent Simulations:** Handle Hamiltonians and collapse operators with arbitrary time dependencies.
*   **Efficient Numerical Backends:** Leverages the power of NumPy, SciPy, and Cython for numerical calculations.
*   **Versatile Visualization:** Provides graphical output using Matplotlib for clear and insightful results.
*   **Free and Open Source:** Available for use and modification under a New BSD license, making it ideal for both research and educational purposes.
*   **Cross-Platform Compatibility:** Works seamlessly on Unix-based platforms and Windows.
*   **Community Support:** Actively supported by the Unitary Fund and NumFOCUS.

## Installation

QuTiP is easily installable via `pip` or `conda`:
