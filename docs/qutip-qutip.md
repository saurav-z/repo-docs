## Key Features

*   **Simulates Quantum Dynamics:** Efficiently models both closed and open quantum systems, including those with time-dependent Hamiltonians and collapse operators.
*   **Versatile Numerical Backends:** Leverages the performance of NumPy, SciPy, and Cython for numerical computations.
*   **Visualizations:** Provides graphical output through Matplotlib for clear and informative data presentation.
*   **User-Friendly:** Designed to be accessible for researchers and students, making quantum mechanics exploration easier.
*   **Open Source and Free:** Available for use and modification on all Unix-based platforms and Windows, without licensing fees.
*   **Extensive Documentation:** Comprehensive documentation, including tutorials and example notebooks, guides users through the software.

## Installation

QuTiP is readily available via `pip` and `conda` (in the `conda-forge` channel).

**Install with pip:**
```bash
pip install qutip
```
or for optional dependencies:
```bash
pip install qutip[full]
```
