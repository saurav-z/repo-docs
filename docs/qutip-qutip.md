# QuTiP: Quantum Toolbox in Python - Simulate Quantum Systems with Ease

QuTiP (Quantum Toolbox in Python) is a powerful open-source software designed for simulating the dynamics of closed and open quantum systems.  [Visit the original repository for more information](https://github.com/qutip/qutip).

**Key Features:**

*   **Open-Source & Free:**  Freely available for research and education.
*   **Versatile Quantum Simulations:** Simulates a wide range of quantum mechanical problems, including those with time-dependent Hamiltonians and/or collapse operators.
*   **Efficient Numerical Backends:** Utilizes NumPy, SciPy, and Cython for efficient numerical computations.
*   **User-Friendly Interface:** Designed for ease of use in both research and classroom settings.
*   **Cross-Platform Compatibility:** Compatible with Unix-based platforms and Windows.
*   **Graphical Output:**  Uses Matplotlib for clear and informative visualizations.
*   **Active Community:** Supported by a dedicated community for contributions, bug reports, and Q&A.

**Installation:**

QuTiP is readily available for installation via `pip` or `conda`:
