# QuTiP: Quantum Toolbox in Python - Simulate Quantum Systems with Ease

**QuTiP (Quantum Toolbox in Python) is a powerful and user-friendly open-source software package for simulating the dynamics of closed and open quantum systems.**  For the original repository, visit [qutip/qutip](https://github.com/qutip/qutip).

## Key Features

*   **Efficient Simulations:** Leverages NumPy, SciPy, and Cython for high-performance numerical calculations.
*   **Versatile Dynamics:** Supports simulations with time-dependent Hamiltonians and collapse operators.
*   **Open Quantum Systems:**  Models both closed and open quantum systems, essential for various physics applications.
*   **User-Friendly:** Designed for ease of use, making it ideal for both research and educational purposes.
*   **Cross-Platform Compatibility:** Works seamlessly on Unix-based platforms and Windows.
*   **Free and Open Source:**  Available under a New BSD license, allowing for free use and modification.

## Installation

QuTiP is readily available through both `pip` and `conda` (via the `conda-forge` channel).

**Install using pip:**

```bash
pip install qutip
```

**Install with all optional dependencies:**

```bash
pip install qutip[full]
```
