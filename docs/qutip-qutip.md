# QuTiP: Quantum Toolbox in Python

**QuTiP is a powerful open-source software designed to simulate the dynamics of closed and open quantum systems, offering a comprehensive toolkit for quantum mechanics research and education.** ([Original Repository](https://github.com/qutip/qutip))

## Key Features

*   **Open-Source:** Freely available for use, modification, and distribution under a New BSD license.
*   **Versatile Simulations:** Enables efficient numerical simulations of a wide range of quantum mechanical problems, including those with time-dependent Hamiltonians and collapse operators.
*   **Python-Based:** Leverages the power of Python with the NumPy, SciPy, and Cython packages for numerical backends, and Matplotlib for graphical output.
*   **Cross-Platform Compatibility:** Works seamlessly on Unix-based platforms and Windows.
*   **User-Friendly:** Designed to be accessible for both researchers and students exploring quantum mechanics.
*   **Extensive Documentation:** Comprehensive documentation available, including installation guides, tutorials, and API references.

## Installation

QuTiP is readily available through:

*   **pip:** `pip install qutip` (minimal installation) or `pip install qutip[full]` (with optional dependencies).
*   **conda:** Available via the `conda-forge` channel.
