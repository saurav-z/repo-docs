# QuTiP: Quantum Toolbox in Python

**QuTiP empowers researchers and educators to simulate the dynamics of quantum systems with an easy-to-use, open-source Python package.** ([Original Repository](https://github.com/qutip/qutip))

## Key Features

*   **Open-Source:** Freely available for research, education, and modification under a New BSD license.
*   **Versatile Simulation:** Simulate a wide variety of quantum mechanical problems, including those with time-dependent Hamiltonians and/or collapse operators.
*   **Efficient Numerical Backends:** Leverages the power of NumPy, SciPy, and Cython for high-performance computations.
*   **User-Friendly:** Designed for ease of use, making it ideal for both research and classroom settings.
*   **Cross-Platform Compatibility:** Works seamlessly on all Unix-based platforms and Windows.
*   **Graphical Output:** Provides graphical output via Matplotlib for easy data visualization.
