# QuTiP: Quantum Toolbox in Python - Simulate Quantum Systems with Ease

QuTiP (Quantum Toolbox in Python) is a powerful open-source software package for simulating the dynamics of closed and open quantum systems, providing researchers and educators with a versatile tool for exploring the quantum world. ([See the original repository](https://github.com/qutip/qutip)).

## Key Features

*   **Simulate Quantum Dynamics:** Model both closed and open quantum systems, including those with time-dependent Hamiltonians and collapse operators.
*   **User-Friendly Interface:** Designed for efficient numerical simulations, suitable for a wide range of quantum mechanical problems.
*   **Built on Powerful Libraries:** Leverages the capabilities of NumPy, SciPy, and Cython for numerical backends, with Matplotlib for graphical output.
*   **Open Source & Accessible:** Freely available for use, modification, and distribution on all Unix-based platforms and Windows.
*   **Ideal for Research and Education:** A valuable tool for both academic research and classroom exploration of quantum mechanics.

## Installation

Install QuTiP easily using pip or conda:

```bash
pip install qutip
```

or to install with optional dependencies:

```bash
pip install qutip[full]
```

For detailed installation instructions, including building from source, please refer to the [detailed installation guide](https://qutip.readthedocs.io/en/stable/installation.html).
