# QuTiP: Quantum Toolbox in Python

**QuTiP is an open-source Python library designed for simulating the dynamics of closed and open quantum systems.** ([Original Repository](https://github.com/qutip/qutip))

QuTiP provides a user-friendly and efficient platform for numerical simulations across a wide array of quantum mechanical problems.  It leverages the power of Python's scientific computing ecosystem, including NumPy, SciPy, and Cython, for its numerical backends, with graphical output via Matplotlib.

## Key Features:

*   **Simulates Quantum Dynamics:**  Accurately models the evolution of quantum systems.
*   **Handles Complex Systems:**  Works with time-dependent Hamiltonians and/or collapse operators.
*   **Open and Closed Systems:** Models both closed and open quantum systems.
*   **Python-Based:** Leverages the Python ecosystem.
*   **User-Friendly:** Designed for ease of use and efficient simulation.
*   **Cross-Platform:** Runs on Unix-based platforms and Windows.
*   **Free and Open Source:**  Available under a New BSD license.

## Installation

QuTiP is readily available via `pip` and `conda` (conda-forge).

*   **pip:** `pip install qutip` (minimal installation) or `pip install qutip[full]` (with optional dependencies).
*   **conda:** See [Installation Guide](https://qutip.readthedocs.io/en/stable/installation.html) for details.
