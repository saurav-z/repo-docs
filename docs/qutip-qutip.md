QuTiP is a powerful, open-source Python library designed for simulating the dynamics of closed and open quantum systems, providing a user-friendly platform for both research and education.  ([See the original repo](https://github.com/qutip/qutip)).

## Key Features

*   **Versatile Simulation:** Simulate a wide array of quantum mechanical problems, including time-dependent Hamiltonians and collapse operators.
*   **Open Source & Free:**  Freely available for use, modification, and redistribution under the New BSD license.
*   **Cross-Platform Compatibility:** Works seamlessly on Unix-based systems and Windows.
*   **Numerical Backend:** Leverages the power of NumPy, SciPy, and Cython for efficient numerical computations.
*   **Graphical Output:** Integrates with Matplotlib for visualizing simulation results.
*   **Broad Applicability:** Suitable for exploring quantum mechanics in research and education.

## Installation

QuTiP is easily installed using `pip` or `conda`:

```bash
pip install qutip
```
or
```bash
conda install -c conda-forge qutip
```

For more installation options, including installing with optional dependencies or building from source, see the [detailed installation guide in the documentation](https://qutip.readthedocs.io/en/stable/installation.html).
