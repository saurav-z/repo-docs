# QuTiP: Quantum Toolbox in Python - Simulate Quantum Systems

**QuTiP** is a powerful, open-source Python library designed for the numerical simulation of quantum mechanical systems.  Explore the world of quantum physics with this versatile toolbox!  [Visit the original repository on GitHub](https://github.com/qutip/qutip).

## Key Features

*   **Open Source:** Freely available for research, education, and modification.
*   **Efficient Numerical Simulations:** Simulates the dynamics of closed and open quantum systems.
*   **Versatile:** Handles Hamiltonians and collapse operators with arbitrary time-dependence.
*   **Python-Based:** Leverages the power of NumPy, SciPy, and Cython for numerical backends.
*   **Graphical Output:** Utilizes Matplotlib for visualizing simulation results.
*   **Cross-Platform Compatibility:** Runs on Unix-based systems and Windows.
*   **Well-Documented:** Extensive documentation and tutorials available.
*   **Active Community:** Contribute to development, ask questions, and share your work.

## Installation

QuTiP is readily available through `pip` and `conda` (via `conda-forge`):

```bash
pip install qutip  # Minimal installation
pip install qutip[full] # Installs with optional dependencies
```

For detailed installation instructions, including building from source, consult the [official documentation](https://qutip.readthedocs.io/en/stable/installation.html).  Pre-release versions are also available with `pip install --pre qutip`.
