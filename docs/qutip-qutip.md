## Key Features

*   **Open-Source:** Freely available for use and modification under a New BSD license.
*   **Versatile Simulation:** Simulates the dynamics of closed and open quantum systems, including those with time-dependent Hamiltonians and collapse operators.
*   **Python-Based:** Leverages the power of Python with NumPy, SciPy, and Cython for numerical calculations, and Matplotlib for graphical output.
*   **Cross-Platform Compatibility:** Works seamlessly on Unix-based platforms and Windows.
*   **User-Friendly:** Designed for efficient numerical simulations across a wide array of quantum mechanical problems.
