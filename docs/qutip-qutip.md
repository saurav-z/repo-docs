QuTiP provides a powerful and user-friendly environment for quantum mechanics research and education, built on Python and leveraging the power of NumPy, SciPy, and Cython.

## Key Features

*   **Simulate Quantum Systems:** Model both closed and open quantum systems with time-dependent Hamiltonians and collapse operators.
*   **Efficient Numerical Simulations:** Utilizes NumPy, SciPy, and Cython for high-performance numerical backends.
*   **User-Friendly Interface:** Designed for easy use, ideal for both research and classroom settings.
*   **Visualization:** Offers graphical output via Matplotlib for clear representation of results.
*   **Cross-Platform Compatibility:** Works seamlessly on Unix-based platforms and Windows.
*   **Open Source & Free:** Accessible for use, modification, and distribution without licensing fees.
*   **Comprehensive Documentation:** Extensive documentation, tutorials, and demonstration notebooks are available.

## Installation

QuTiP is readily available through:

*   **pip:** `pip install qutip` (minimal installation) or `pip install qutip[full]` (with optional dependencies).
*   **conda:** `conda install -c conda-forge qutip`
