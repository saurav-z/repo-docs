# QuTiP: Quantum Toolbox in Python - Simulate Quantum Systems with Ease

**QuTiP (Quantum Toolbox in Python) is a powerful, open-source software for simulating the dynamics of closed and open quantum systems, providing researchers and educators with a versatile platform for exploring quantum mechanics.**  [Visit the original repository on GitHub](https://github.com/qutip/qutip).

## Key Features:

*   **Open-Source & Free:**  Freely available for use, modification, and distribution under a New BSD license.
*   **Versatile Simulation:**  Simulates a wide range of quantum mechanical problems, including those with time-dependent Hamiltonians and collapse operators.
*   **Numerical Backend:** Leverages the efficiency of NumPy, SciPy, and Cython for numerical computations.
*   **Graphical Output:**  Utilizes Matplotlib for generating visualizations of simulation results.
*   **Cross-Platform Compatibility:** Compatible with Unix-based platforms and Windows.
*   **User-Friendly:** Designed for efficient numerical simulations and easy exploration of quantum mechanics.
*   **Extensive Documentation and Tutorials:**  Comprehensive documentation, tutorials, and examples to get you started quickly.

## Installation

QuTiP is readily available through both `pip` and `conda` (via the `conda-forge` channel).

**Installation via pip (minimal):**
