# Stable Diffusion Web UI: Unleash Your Creativity with AI-Powered Image Generation

**Transform your imagination into stunning visuals with the Stable Diffusion Web UI, a user-friendly web interface for Stable Diffusion, built with the Gradio library. Access the original repository [here](https://github.com/AUTOMATIC1111/stable-diffusion-webui).**

This powerful tool empowers users of all levels to create amazing images from text prompts, refine existing images, and explore innovative artistic techniques.

## Key Features:

*   **txt2img & img2img Modes:** Generate images from text prompts or modify existing images.
*   **One-Click Installation:** Get started quickly with easy setup scripts (Python and Git required).
*   **Advanced Image Editing:** Outpainting, inpainting, color sketches, and prompt matrix functionality.
*   **Attention & Prompt Control:** Fine-tune image generation with attention mechanisms and prompt weighting.
*   **Upscaling & Enhancement:** Improve image quality with Stable Diffusion Upscale and other advanced upscalers (GFPGAN, CodeFormer, RealESRGAN, ESRGAN, SwinIR/Swin2SR, LDSR).
*   **Interactive Features:** Live previews, interrupt processing, and a progress bar to monitor your generations.
*   **Negative Prompts:** Refine images by specifying what you *don't* want to see.
*   **Extensive Customization:** Seed control, sampling method selection, and generation parameter saving.
*   **AI-Driven Enhancements:** Integrated face restoration tools and advanced upscaling options.
*   **Extensions and Add-ons:** Extend functionality with a growing library of community-created scripts and features (e.g., history tab, aesthetic gradients).
*   **Advanced Techniques:** Includes features like X/Y/Z plots, textual inversion, variations, and seed resizing, Composable-Diffusion and more.
*   **Comprehensive Training Features:** Includes features for hypernetworks, LoRAs, embeddings, and model training.
*   **User-Friendly Interface:** Includes UI element reordering, mouseover hints, and a settings page.
*   **Multiple Model Support:** Supports Stable Diffusion 2.0, Alt-Diffusion, and Segmind Stable Diffusion.
*   **API Integration:** Integrate the web UI into your workflows.
*   **Advanced Features:** Includes features for no token limits, deepdanbooru integration, xformers, aesthetic gradients, and more.
