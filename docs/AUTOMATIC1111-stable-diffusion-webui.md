# Stable Diffusion Web UI: Generate Stunning Images with Ease

**Unleash your creativity and bring your imagination to life with the Stable Diffusion web UI, a powerful and user-friendly interface for generating AI-powered images based on text prompts.** ([Original Repo](https://github.com/AUTOMATIC1111/stable-diffusion-webui))

## Key Features:

*   **User-Friendly Interface:** Intuitive Gradio-based web interface makes image generation accessible to everyone.
*   **txt2img and img2img Modes:** Generate images from text prompts (txt2img) or modify existing images (img2img).
*   **One-Click Installation:** Simplified installation script for quick setup (Python and Git required).
*   **Advanced Features:**
    *   **Outpainting & Inpainting:** Expand and modify images beyond their original boundaries.
    *   **Prompt Engineering:** Fine-tune image generation with attention mechanisms, negative prompts, styles, and variations.
    *   **Upscaling & Enhancement:** Improve image quality with integrated tools like GFPGAN, RealESRGAN, and more.
    *   **Interactive Features:** Real-time previews, progress bars, and the ability to interrupt processing.
*   **Extensive Customization:**
    *   **Checkpoint & Model Management:** Load and switch between various Stable Diffusion models and checkpoints on the fly.
    *   **Extensions & Scripts:** Expand functionality with community-created scripts and extensions.
    *   **Training:** Train custom embeddings, hypernetworks, and LoRAs for personalized image generation.
*   **Advanced Control:**
    *   **X/Y/Z Plot:** Visualize the impact of different parameters with 3D image plots.
    *   **Seed Control:** Generate variations of images with seed resizing.
    *   **Prompt Editing and token limits:** Change prompt mid-generation. No token limit
*   **Support for diverse models** Stable Diffusion 2.0 and Alt-Diffusion. Segmind Stable Diffusion support.
*   **API Integration:** Access the web UI's functionality through an API for integration into other applications.
