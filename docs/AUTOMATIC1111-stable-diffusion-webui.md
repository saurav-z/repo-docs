# Stable Diffusion WebUI: Unleash Your Creativity with AI-Powered Image Generation

Unleash your imagination and create stunning AI-generated images with the Stable Diffusion web UI, a user-friendly interface for Stable Diffusion, offering a wide array of features and customization options. ([Original Repo](https://github.com/AUTOMATIC1111/stable-diffusion-webui))

## Key Features:

*   **Versatile Image Generation Modes:** Generate images from text prompts (txt2img), modify existing images (img2img), outpaint, and inpaint with ease.
*   **One-Click Installation:** Simplify the setup process with a convenient one-click install and run script (Python and Git required).
*   **Advanced Image Manipulation:** Utilize features like color sketches, prompt matrices, and Stable Diffusion upscaling for enhanced control.
*   **Attention & Prompt Customization:** Fine-tune the model's focus with attention mechanisms, including attention syntax for weighting words and phrases, and use prompt editing to change prompts mid-generation.
*   **Innovative Techniques:** Experiment with Loopback, X/Y/Z plots, variations, and seed resizing to explore different image variations.
*   **Textual Inversion & LoRAs:** Train and utilize textual inversions and LoRAs (Like Hypernetworks, but prettier) for custom styles and appearances.
*   **Powerful Extras:** Enhance your images with integrated tools like GFPGAN, CodeFormer, RealESRGAN, ESRGAN, and SwinIR upscalers, and apply aesthetic gradients to specific aesthetics.
*   **Custom Scripts & Extensions:** Extend functionality with custom scripts and community extensions for advanced capabilities.
*   **Deep Integration:** Utilize DeepDanbooru for anime prompts, and Composable Diffusion to use multiple prompts simultaneously.
*   **Comprehensive Features:** Enjoy features like negative prompts, styles, CLIP interrogator, batch processing, high-res fix, checkpoint merging, and much more.
*   **Supports Stable Diffusion 2.0, Alt-Diffusion, and Segmind Stable Diffusion models.**
*   **Additional features:** Added options for hypernetworks, clip skip, and VAE selection.
