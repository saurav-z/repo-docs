# Stable Diffusion Web UI: Unleash Your Creativity with AI-Powered Image Generation

**Create stunning images from text prompts with the Stable Diffusion web UI, a user-friendly interface built with Gradio.** ([Original Repo](https://github.com/AUTOMATIC1111/stable-diffusion-webui))

## Key Features:

*   **Effortless Image Generation:** Generate images from text prompts with txt2img and img2img modes.
*   **One-Click Installation:**  Get up and running quickly with a simple install script (Python and Git required).
*   **Advanced Editing Tools:** Utilize outpainting, inpainting, color sketches, and prompt matrix for precise control.
*   **Image Enhancement:** Upscale and refine images with GFPGAN, CodeFormer, RealESRGAN, ESRGAN, and more.
*   **Prompt Customization:**  Fine-tune image generation with attention mechanisms, negative prompts, styles, and variations.
*   **Advanced Features:** Explore X/Y/Z plots, textual inversion, custom scripts, Composable Diffusion, and other advanced capabilities.
*   **Batch Processing & Parameter Handling:** Process multiple files and save/load generation parameters for consistent results.
*   **Wide Hardware Support:** Supports 4GB video cards (and even 2GB with some settings), and can run on both Nvidia and AMD GPUs, as well as Intel CPUs and GPUs.
*   **Extensive Community Support:** Benefit from community-developed extensions and a comprehensive wiki.

## Getting Started:

Detailed installation instructions are available in the [wiki](https://github.com/AUTOMATIC1111/stable-diffusion-webui/wiki) with specific guides for:

*   NVidia GPUs (Recommended)
*   AMD GPUs
*   Intel CPUs and GPUs
*   Ascend NPUs
*   Apple Silicon
*   Online Services (Google Colab, etc.)

## Installation Steps (Windows with NVidia GPUs - Example):
