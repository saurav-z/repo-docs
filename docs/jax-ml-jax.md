## What is JAX?

JAX is a powerful Python library designed for high-performance numerical computing and large-scale machine learning. It provides a flexible framework for transforming numerical functions, enabling automatic differentiation, just-in-time compilation, and vectorization.  JAX leverages the power of [XLA](https://www.openxla.org/xla) to compile and scale your NumPy programs on TPUs, GPUs, and other hardware accelerators.

Here's a quick code example showcasing JAX's capabilities:

```python
import jax
import jax.numpy as jnp

def predict(params, inputs):
  for W, b in params:
    outputs = jnp.dot(inputs, W) + b
    inputs = jnp.tanh(outputs)  # inputs to the next layer
  return outputs                # no activation on last layer

def loss(params, inputs, targets):
  preds = predict(params, inputs)
  return jnp.sum((preds - targets)**2)

grad_loss = jax.jit(jax.grad(loss))  # compiled gradient evaluation function
perex_grads = jax.jit(jax.vmap(grad_loss, in_axes=(None, 0, 0)))  # fast per-example grads
```

## Transformations

JAX's core strength lies in its ability to transform numerical functions.  Key transformations include: `jax.grad`, `jax.jit`, and `jax.vmap`.

### Automatic Differentiation with `grad`

Use `jax.grad` to efficiently compute reverse-mode gradients:

```python
import jax
import jax.numpy as jnp

def tanh(x):
  y = jnp.exp(-2.0 * x)
  return (1.0 - y) / (1.0 + y)

grad_tanh = jax.grad(tanh)
print(grad_tanh(1.0))
# prints 0.4199743
```

You can differentiate to any order with `grad`:

```python
print(jax.grad(jax.grad(jax.grad(tanh)))(1.0))
# prints 0.62162673
```

Differentiation works seamlessly with Python control flow:

```python
def abs_val(x):
  if x > 0:
    return x
  else:
    return -x

abs_val_grad = jax.grad(abs_val)
print(abs_val_grad(1.0))   # prints 1.0
print(abs_val_grad(-1.0))  # prints -1.0 (abs_val is re-evaluated)
```

Refer to the [JAX Autodiff Cookbook](https://docs.jax.dev/en/latest/notebooks/autodiff_cookbook.html) and the [reference docs on automatic differentiation](https://docs.jax.dev/en/latest/jax.html#automatic-differentiation) for more information.

### Compilation with `jit`

Use XLA to compile your functions end-to-end with [`jit`](https://docs.jax.dev/en/latest/jax.html#just-in-time-compilation-jit), used either as an `@jit` decorator or as a higher-order function.

```python
import jax
import jax.numpy as jnp

def slow_f(x):
  # Element-wise ops see a large benefit from fusion
  return x * x + x * 2.0

x = jnp.ones((5000, 5000))
fast_f = jax.jit(slow_f)
%timeit -n10 -r3 fast_f(x)
%timeit -n10 -r3 slow_f(x)
```

Consult the tutorial on [Control Flow and Logical Operators with JIT](https://docs.jax.dev/en/latest/control-flow.html) for details on control flow limitations when using `jax.jit`.

### Auto-vectorization with `vmap`

[`vmap`](https://docs.jax.dev/en/latest/jax.html#vectorization-vmap) maps a function along array axes, optimizing performance by pushing the loop down to the primitive operations.

`vmap` simplifies your code and often eliminates the need to carry around batch dimensions:

```python
import jax
import jax.numpy as jnp

def l1_distance(x, y):
  assert x.ndim == y.ndim == 1  # only works on 1D inputs
  return jnp.sum(jnp.abs(x - y))

def pairwise_distances(dist1D, xs):
  return jax.vmap(jax.vmap(dist1D, (0, None)), (None, 0))(xs, xs)

xs = jax.random.normal(jax.random.key(0), (100, 3))
dists = pairwise_distances(l1_distance, xs)
dists.shape  # (100, 100)
```

Compose `jax.vmap` with `jax.grad` and `jax.jit` to achieve efficient Jacobian matrices or per-example gradients:

```python
per_example_grads = jax.jit(jax.vmap(jax.grad(loss), in_axes=(None, 0, 0)))
```

## Scaling

JAX empowers you to scale computations across thousands of devices.  Key scaling modes include:

*   **Compiler-based automatic parallelization:** Program with a global view, and the compiler handles data sharding and computation partitioning.
*   **Explicit sharding and automatic partitioning:**  Maintain a global view with explicit data shardings.
*   **Manual per-device programming:**  Work with a per-device view of data and computation, enabling explicit communication.

| Mode        | View?       | Explicit Sharding? | Explicit Collectives? |
| ----------- | ----------- | ------------------ | --------------------- |
| Auto        | Global      | ❌                 | ❌                    |
| Explicit    | Global      | ✅                 | ❌                    |
| Manual      | Per-device | ✅                 | ✅                    |

```python
from jax.sharding import set_mesh, AxisType, PartitionSpec as P
mesh = jax.make_mesh((8,), ('data',), axis_types=(AxisType.Explicit,))
set_mesh(mesh)

# parameters are sharded for FSDP:
for W, b in params:
  print(f'{jax.typeof(W)}')  # f32[512@data,512]
  print(f'{jax.typeof(b)}')  # f32[512]

# shard data for batch parallelism:
inputs, targets = jax.device_put((inputs, targets), P('data'))

# evaluate gradients, automatically parallelized!
gradfun = jax.jit(jax.grad(loss))
param_grads = gradfun(params, (inputs, targets))
```
