## What is JAX?

JAX is a Python library designed for high-performance numerical computing and machine learning. It combines accelerator-oriented array computation with powerful program transformation capabilities, built for speed and scalability. It's well suited for research due to its ability to differentiate through complex code, including loops, branches, and recursion. JAX utilizes XLA to compile and scale NumPy programs on various hardware accelerators, allowing you to easily optimize your code.

## Transformations

JAX's core strength lies in its ability to transform numerical functions.

### Automatic differentiation with `grad`

Compute reverse-mode gradients efficiently using `jax.grad`.

```python
import jax
import jax.numpy as jnp

def tanh(x):
  y = jnp.exp(-2.0 * x)
  return (1.0 - y) / (1.0 + y)

grad_tanh = jax.grad(tanh)
print(grad_tanh(1.0))
# prints 0.4199743
```

Differentiate to any order with `grad`:

```python
print(jax.grad(jax.grad(jax.grad(tanh)))(1.0))
# prints 0.62162673
```

See the [JAX Autodiff
Cookbook](https://docs.jax.dev/en/latest/notebooks/autodiff_cookbook.html)
and the [reference docs on automatic
differentiation](https://docs.jax.dev/en/latest/jax.html#automatic-differentiation)
for more.

### Compilation with `jit`

Use XLA to compile your functions end-to-end with
[`jit`](https://docs.jax.dev/en/latest/jax.html#just-in-time-compilation-jit),
used either as an `@jit` decorator or as a higher-order function.

```python
import jax
import jax.numpy as jnp

def slow_f(x):
  # Element-wise ops see a large benefit from fusion
  return x * x + x * 2.0

x = jnp.ones((5000, 5000))
fast_f = jax.jit(slow_f)
%timeit -n10 -r3 fast_f(x)
%timeit -n10 -r3 slow_f(x)
```

### Auto-vectorization with `vmap`

[`vmap`](https://docs.jax.dev/en/latest/jax.html#vectorization-vmap) maps
a function along array axes.
But instead of just looping over function applications, it pushes the loop down
onto the function’s primitive operations, e.g. turning matrix-vector multiplies into
matrix-matrix multiplies for better performance.

Using `vmap` can save you from having to carry around batch dimensions in your
code:

```python
import jax
import jax.numpy as jnp

def l1_distance(x, y):
  assert x.ndim == y.ndim == 1  # only works on 1D inputs
  return jnp.sum(jnp.abs(x - y))

def pairwise_distances(dist1D, xs):
  return jax.vmap(jax.vmap(dist1D, (0, None)), (None, 0))(xs, xs)

xs = jax.random.normal(jax.random.key(0), (100, 3))
dists = pairwise_distances(l1_distance, xs)
dists.shape  # (100, 100)
```

## Scaling

JAX enables scaling computations across thousands of devices through a variety of methods:

*   **Compiler-based automatic parallelization:** Program as if using a single machine, and the compiler handles data sharding and computation partitioning.
*   **Explicit sharding and automatic partitioning:** Define data shardings using JAX types for more control.
*   **Manual per-device programming:** Offers a per-device view of data and computation with explicit collectives.

| Mode | View? | Explicit sharding? | Explicit Collectives? |
|---|---|---|---|
| Auto | Global | ❌ | ❌ |
| Explicit | Global | ✅ | ❌ |
| Manual | Per-device | ✅ | ✅ |

```python
from jax.sharding import set_mesh, AxisType, PartitionSpec as P
mesh = jax.make_mesh((8,), ('data',), axis_types=(AxisType.Explicit,))
set_mesh(mesh)

# parameters are sharded for FSDP:
for W, b in params:
  print(f'{jax.typeof(W)}')  # f32[512@data,512]
  print(f'{jax.typeof(b)}')  # f32[512]

# shard data for batch parallelism:
inputs, targets = jax.device_put((inputs, targets), P('data'))

# evaluate gradients, automatically parallelized!
gradfun = jax.jit(jax.grad(loss))
param_grads = gradfun(params, (inputs, targets))
```
