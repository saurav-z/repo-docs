# JAX: High-Performance Numerical Computing with Autodiff and XLA

[JAX](https://github.com/jax-ml/jax) is a powerful Python library designed for high-performance numerical computing and machine learning, offering automatic differentiation, XLA compilation, and array transformations.

*   **Automatic Differentiation:** Effortlessly calculate gradients of native Python and NumPy functions, including through loops, branches, and recursion.
*   **XLA Compilation:** Compile your NumPy programs on TPUs, GPUs, and other accelerators for significant speedups using [XLA](https://www.openxla.org/xla).
*   **Function Transformations:** Leverage composable transformations like `jax.grad`, `jax.jit`, and `jax.vmap` to optimize and scale your code.
*   **Scaling:**  Scale your computations across thousands of devices, from compiler-based automatic parallelization to explicit sharding.

## Key Features

*   **Automatic Differentiation:** Compute gradients (derivatives) of any order with ease, even through complex control flow.
*   **Just-In-Time (JIT) Compilation:** Speed up your code with XLA compilation using `@jax.jit` or as a function.
*   **Vectorization (vmap):**  Automatically vectorize functions for efficient batch processing using `jax.vmap`.
*   **Accelerated Computing:** Run your code on GPUs, TPUs, and other hardware accelerators.
*   **Scalable Operations:** Distribute and parallelize computations across multiple devices.

## Getting Started

| AMD GPU (Linux) | Follow [AMD's instructions](https://github.com/jax-ml/jax/blob/main/build/rocm/README.md).                      |
| Mac GPU         | Follow [Apple's instructions](https://developer.apple.com/metal/jax/).           |
| Intel GPU       | Follow [Intel's instructions](https://github.com/intel/intel-extension-for-openxla/blob/main/docs/acc_jax.md).  |

For more installation options, please consult the [JAX Installation Guide](https://docs.jax.dev/en/latest/installation.html).

### Example

```python
import jax
import jax.numpy as jnp

def predict(params, inputs):
  for W, b in params:
    outputs = jnp.dot(inputs, W) + b
    inputs = jnp.tanh(outputs)  # inputs to the next layer
  return outputs

def loss(params, inputs, targets):
  preds = predict(params, inputs)
  return jnp.sum((preds - targets)**2)

grad_loss = jax.jit(jax.grad(loss))  # compiled gradient evaluation function
```
