## Key Features

*   **Advanced SRR Paradigm:** MonkeyOCR leverages a Structure-Recognition-Relation (SRR) triplet paradigm for efficient and accurate document parsing.
*   **Superior Performance:** Achieves state-of-the-art results, outperforming leading models on benchmarks such as OmniDocBench and olmOCR-Bench.
*   **Speed & Efficiency:** Offers significant speed improvements compared to previous versions, particularly with the MonkeyOCR-pro-1.2B model, without sacrificing accuracy.
*   **Versatile:** Supports various document types, including PDFs, images, and complex layouts with text, formulas, and tables.
*   **Open Source & Accessible:**  Freely available for research and non-commercial use, with pre-trained models, demo, and comprehensive documentation.

## What's New

*   üöÄ **MonkeyOCR-pro-1.2B:** Released a faster and more accurate version that outperforms the previous 3B version on Chinese documents, with a speed increase of up to 36%.
*   ‚≠ê **Trending on Hugging Face:** Recognized for outstanding performance in the document parsing space.

## Performance Highlights

*   **OmniDocBench:** MonkeyOCR-pro-3B achieves top-tier results, outperforming closed-source and extra-large open-source VLMs.
*   **olmOCR-Bench:**  MonkeyOCR-pro-1.2B excels, surpassing Nanonets-OCR-3B by 7.3%.

### Benchmarks and Results

*   **OmniDocBench Results:** Refer to the benchmark table above for end-to-end evaluation results, comparing MonkeyOCR against other leading models.

### Detailed benchmark tables were provided in the original README:
1.  The end-to-end evaluation results of different tasks.
2.  The end-to-end text recognition performance across 9 PDF page types.
3.  The evaluation results of olmOCR-bench.

## Quick Start

### 1. Installation

*   Follow the [installation guide](https://github.com/Yuliang-Liu/MonkeyOCR/blob/main/docs/install_cuda_pp.md#install-with-cuda-support) to set up your environment.

### 2. Model Download

*   Download from Hugging Face:

    ```bash
    pip install huggingface_hub
    python tools/download_model.py -n MonkeyOCR-pro-3B  # or MonkeyOCR
    ```
*   Download from ModelScope:

    ```bash
    pip install modelscope
    python tools/download_model.py -t modelscope -n MonkeyOCR-pro-3B  # or MonkeyOCR
    ```

### 3. Inference

*   Use the `parse.py` script to process PDFs, images, or directories.  Example commands are provided, allowing for single-file, single-task, and batch processing, as well as configurations for grouping pages and specifying output directories.

### 4. Demo and API

*   **Gradio Demo:** Run `python demo/demo_gradio.py` and access at `http://localhost:7860`.
*   **FastAPI:** Start the API service using `uvicorn api.main:app --port 8000` and access the documentation at `http://localhost:8000/docs`.

### 5. Deployment

*   **Docker:** Easily deploy with Docker Compose.  Complete instructions are provided for building and running the Docker image, including GPU support. Instructions are given for running with both the Gradio demo and the FastAPI service.

## Additional Resources

*   **Windows Support:** Detailed in the [windows support guide](docs/windows_support.md).
*   **Quantization:**  Instructions for quantizing the model are in the [quantization guide](docs/Quantization.md).
*   **Supported Hardware:** Tested on a variety of GPUs; community contributions have expanded hardware support.
*   **Visualization Demo:** http://vlrlabmonkey.xyz:7685 (The latest model is available for selection)
