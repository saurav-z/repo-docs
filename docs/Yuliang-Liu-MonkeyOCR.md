## Key Features

*   **SRR Paradigm:** Simplifies document parsing by combining structure recognition, content extraction, and relationship understanding.
*   **Superior Performance:** Outperforms leading closed-source and open-source VLMs in various benchmarks.
*   **Optimized Speed:** Offers significant speed improvements over previous versions, especially the pro-1.2B model.
*   **Flexible Deployment:** Supports various GPUs and deployment methods including local installation, Gradio demo, and Docker.
*   **Comprehensive Output:** Provides Markdown files, layout results, and detailed intermediate results for easy analysis.

## Introduction

MonkeyOCR revolutionizes document parsing using a unique Structure-Recognition-Relation (SRR) triplet paradigm. This approach simplifies the process compared to modular pipelines and avoids the inefficiencies of large multimodal models, achieving state-of-the-art results across diverse document types.

*   **MonkeyOCR-pro-1.2B** surpasses MonkeyOCR-3B by 7.4% on Chinese documents.
*   **MonkeyOCR-pro-1.2B** is approximately 36% faster than MonkeyOCR-pro-3B while maintaining comparable performance.
*   On **olmOCR-Bench**, MonkeyOCR-pro-1.2B outperforms Nanonets-OCR-3B by 7.3%.
*   On **OmniDocBench**, MonkeyOCR-pro-3B achieves the best overall performance on both English and Chinese documents, outperforming even closed-source VLMs.
