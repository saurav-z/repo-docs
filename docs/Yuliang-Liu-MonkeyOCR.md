## Quick Start Guide

### 1. Local Installation

*   **Prerequisites:**  See the [installation guide](https://github.com/Yuliang-Liu/MonkeyOCR/blob/main/docs/install_cuda_pp.md#install-with-cuda-support) to set up your environment.
*   **Download Model Weights:**
    *   Using Hugging Face:

        ```bash
        pip install huggingface_hub
        python tools/download_model.py -n MonkeyOCR-pro-3B  # or MonkeyOCR
        ```

    *   Using ModelScope:

        ```bash
        pip install modelscope
        python tools/download_model.py -t modelscope -n MonkeyOCR-pro-3B  # or MonkeyOCR
        ```

### 2. Inference

```bash
# Replace input_path with the path to a PDF or image or directory

# End-to-end parsing
python parse.py input_path

# Parse files in a dir with specific group page num
python parse.py input_path -g 20

# Single-task recognition (outputs markdown only)
python parse.py input_path -t text/formula/table

# Parse PDFs in input_path and split results by pages
python parse.py input_path -s

# Specify output directory and model config file
python parse.py input_path -o ./output -c config.yaml
```

For additional usage examples, see the [detailed examples](https://github.com/Yuliang-Liu/MonkeyOCR#quick-start) in the original repository.

### 3. Gradio Demo

```bash
python demo/demo_gradio.py
```
Access the demo at http://localhost:7860.

### 4. FastAPI

```bash
uvicorn api.main:app --port 8000
```
Access API documentation at http://localhost:8000/docs.

## Docker Deployment

1.  Navigate to the `docker` directory:
    ```bash
    cd docker
    ```

2.  **Prerequisite:** Ensure NVIDIA GPU support is available in Docker (via `nvidia-docker2`).
    If GPU support is not enabled, run the following to set up the environment:
    ```bash
    bash env.sh
    ```

3.  Build the Docker image:
    ```bash
    docker compose build monkeyocr
    ```
    > [!IMPORTANT]
    >
    > If your GPU is from the 20/30/40-series, V100, L20/L40 or similar, please build the patched Docker image for LMDeploy compatibility:
    >
    > ```bash
    > docker compose build monkeyocr-fix
    > ```
    >
    > Otherwise, you may encounter the following error: `triton.runtime.errors.OutOfResources: out of resource: shared memory`

4.  Run the container with the Gradio demo:
    ```bash
    docker compose up monkeyocr-demo
    ```
    Alternatively, start an interactive development environment:
    ```bash
    docker compose run --rm monkeyocr-dev
    ```

5.  Run the FastAPI service:
    ```bash
    docker compose up monkeyocr-api
    ```
    Access API documentation at http://localhost:7861/docs.

## Windows Support
