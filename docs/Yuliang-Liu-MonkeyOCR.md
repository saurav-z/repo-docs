## Key Features of MonkeyOCR:

*   **Superior Accuracy:** Achieves state-of-the-art results across various document types, including significant gains on formulas (15.0%) and tables (8.6%).
*   **High Efficiency:** Processes multi-page documents at speeds up to 0.84 pages per second, surpassing competing solutions.
*   **Strong Performance:** Outperforms models like Gemini 2.5 Pro and Qwen2.5 VL-72B on English documents with a 3B-parameter model.
*   **Flexible Output:** Generates markdown files, layout results, and detailed intermediate block results for comprehensive document analysis.
*   **Easy Deployment:** Supports local installation, Hugging Face and ModelScope downloads, and Gradio/FastAPI demo.

## Introduction

MonkeyOCR utilizes a novel Structure-Recognition-Relation (SRR) triplet paradigm, which streamlines document parsing by moving away from multi-tool pipelines, and mitigates inefficiencies associated with processing full-page documents with large multimodal models.  This innovative approach allows MonkeyOCR to excel in parsing both English and Chinese documents.

## Quick Start

### 1. Installation

Follow the [installation guide](https://github.com/Yuliang-Liu/MonkeyOCR/blob/main/docs/install_cuda.md#install-with-cuda-support) to set up your environment, including CUDA support.

### 2. Model Download

Download pre-trained model weights from:

*   Hugging Face:

    ```bash
    pip install huggingface_hub
    python tools/download_model.py
    ```
*   ModelScope:

    ```bash
    pip install modelscope
    python tools/download_model.py -t modelscope
    ```

### 3. Inference

Parse documents using the following commands:

```bash
# End-to-end parsing
python parse.py input_path

# Parse files in a dir with specific group page num
python parse.py input_path -g 20

# Single-task recognition (outputs markdown only)
python parse.py input_path -t text/formula/table

# Parse PDFs in input_path and split results by pages
python parse.py input_path -s

# Specify output directory and model config file
python parse.py input_path -o ./output -c config.yaml
```

<details>
<summary><b>More Usage Examples</b></summary>

```bash
# Single file processing
python parse.py input.pdf                           # Parse single PDF file
python parse.py input.pdf -o ./output               # Parse with custom output dir
python parse.py input.pdf -s                        # Parse PDF with page splitting
python parse.py image.jpg                           # Parse single image file

# Single task recognition
python parse.py image.jpg -t text                   # Text recognition from image
python parse.py image.jpg -t formula                # Formula recognition from image
python parse.py image.jpg -t table                  # Table recognition from image
python parse.py document.pdf -t text                # Text recognition from all PDF pages

# Folder processing (all files individually)
python parse.py /path/to/folder                     # Parse all files in folder
python parse.py /path/to/folder -s                  # Parse with page splitting
python parse.py /path/to/folder -t text             # Single task recognition for all files

# Multi-file grouping (batch processing by page count)
python parse.py /path/to/folder -g 5                # Group files with max 5 total pages
python parse.py /path/to/folder -g 10 -s            # Group files with page splitting
python parse.py /path/to/folder -g 8 -t text        # Group files for single task recognition

# Advanced configurations
python parse.py input.pdf -c model_configs.yaml     # Custom model configuration
python parse.py /path/to/folder -g 15 -s -o ./out   # Group files, split pages, custom output
```

> [!TIP]
> 
> For optimal results with Chinese documents, consider using the `layout_zh.pt` structure detection model from Hugging Face (update `model_configs.yaml`).

#### Output Results
MonkeyOCR generates three types of output files:

1.  **Processed Markdown File** (`your.md`): The final parsed document content in markdown format, containing text, formulas, tables, and other structured elements.
2.  **Layout Results** (`your_layout.pdf`): The layout results drawed on origin PDF.
3.  **Intermediate Block Results** (`your_middle.json`): A JSON file containing detailed information about all detected blocks, including:

    *   Block coordinates and positions
    *   Block content and type information
    *   Relationship information between blocks

These files provide both the final formatted output and detailed intermediate results for further analysis or processing.

### 4. Gradio Demo

```bash
# Start demo
python demo/demo_gradio.py
```

### 5. Fast API

```bash
uvicorn api.main:app --port 8000
```

## Docker Deployment

Simplify deployment with Docker:

1.  Navigate to the `docker` directory.
2.  Ensure NVIDIA GPU support is set up (if applicable) with `bash env.sh`.
3.  Build the Docker image with `docker compose build monkeyocr`.
    *   If using 30/40-series GPUs, build `monkeyocr-fix`.
4.  Run the Gradio demo with `docker compose up monkeyocr-demo`.
    *   Or, for development, use `docker compose run --rm monkeyocr-dev`.
5.  Run the FastAPI service with `docker compose up monkeyocr-api`.

## Windows Support

For Windows deployment, utilize WSL and Docker Desktop - see the [Windows Support](docs/windows_support.md) guide.

## Quantization

Quantize the model using AWQ - see the [Quantization guide](docs/Quantization.md).
