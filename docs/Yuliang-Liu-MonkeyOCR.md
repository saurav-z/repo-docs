# MonkeyOCR: Revolutionizing Document Parsing with Triplet Paradigm

**Tired of clunky document processing pipelines?** MonkeyOCR offers a groundbreaking Structure-Recognition-Relation (SRR) triplet paradigm for streamlined and efficient document parsing.  ([Original Repo](https://github.com/Yuliang-Liu/MonkeyOCR))

**Key Features:**

*   **Superior Performance:** MonkeyOCR-pro-1.2B surpasses previous models in accuracy and speed, outperforming even large, closed-source VLMs.
*   **Blazing Fast Inference:** Experience up to 36% speed improvement with MonkeyOCR-pro-1.2B.
*   **Comprehensive Output:**  Get parsed documents in Markdown, along with layout results and detailed block information.
*   **Easy Deployment:**  Quickly get started with local installation, Gradio demo, or Docker.
*   **Chinese and English Support:**  Exceptional performance on both English and Chinese documents.
*   **Quantization Support:**  Optimize model size and speed with AWQ quantization.

**Benchmark Highlights:**

*   MonkeyOCR-pro-1.2B outperforms Nanonets-OCR-3B by 7.3% on olmOCR-Bench.
*   MonkeyOCR-pro-3B achieves the best overall performance on OmniDocBench, even exceeding closed-source and extra-large open-source VLMs like Gemini 2.5-Pro and GPT-4o.

**Quick Start:**

1.  **Install:**  Follow the [installation guide](https://github.com/Yuliang-Liu/MonkeyOCR/blob/main/docs/install_cuda.md#install-with-cuda-support).
2.  **Download Model Weights:** Get the model from Hugging Face or ModelScope using the provided scripts.
3.  **Inference:** Use the `parse.py` script with various options for PDF/image processing.
4.  **Gradio Demo:** Launch the interactive demo with `python demo/demo_gradio.py`.
5.  **FastAPI:** Deploy the API with `uvicorn api.main:app --port 8000`.
6.  **Docker Deployment:** Build and run a Docker container for easy setup (see the docker directory for details).

**[Further details about model usage and options are available in the original README and the linked documentation files.]**

**Output Results:**

*   **Markdown File:** The final parsed document content, including text, formulas, tables, and other structured elements.
*   **Layout Results:** The layout results drawn on the original PDF.
*   **Intermediate Block Results:** A JSON file with detailed information on all detected blocks, including coordinates, content, type, and relationship.
