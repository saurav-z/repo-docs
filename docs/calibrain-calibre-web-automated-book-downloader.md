**Post-Download Script:** Set `CUSTOM_SCRIPT` to execute a custom script after each download.  The script receives the downloaded file path as an argument.

```yaml
environment:
  - CUSTOM_SCRIPT=/scripts/process-book.sh
volumes:
  - local/scripts/custom_script.sh:/scripts/process-book.sh
```

### Volume Configuration

```yaml
volumes:
  - /your/local/path:/cwa-book-ingest
  - /cwa/config/path/app.db:/auth/app.db:ro
```

**Note:** For CIFS shares, add `nobrl` to your fstab mount options to avoid "database locked" errors.

## Variants

### üßÖ Tor Variant

For enhanced privacy, the Tor variant routes all traffic through the Tor network.

1.  **Get the Tor Compose File:**

    ```bash
    curl -O https://raw.githubusercontent.com/calibrain/calibre-web-automated-book-downloader/refs/heads/main/docker-compose.tor.yml
    ```
2.  **Start the Tor Service:**

    ```bash
    docker compose -f docker-compose.tor.yml up -d
    ```

**Important Tor Considerations:**  This variant requires `NET_ADMIN` and `NET_RAW` Docker capabilities.  Timezone is set by the Tor exit node IP.  Custom DNS and proxy settings are ignored.

### ‚òÅÔ∏è External Cloudflare Resolver Variant

Use an external service to bypass Cloudflare protection.

1.  **Get the External Resolver Compose File:**

    ```bash
    curl -O https://raw.githubusercontent.com/calibrain/calibre-web-automated-book-downloader/refs/heads/main/docker-compose.extbp.yml
    ```
2.  **Start the External Resolver Service:**

    ```bash
    docker compose -f docker-compose.extbp.yml up -d
    ```

#### Configuration

| Variable               | Description                                                 | Default Value           |
| ---------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------- |
| `EXT_BYPASSER_URL`     | The full URL of your external resolver (required)           |                         |
| `EXT_BYPASSER_PATH`    | API path for the resolver (usually `/v1`)                   | `/v1`                   |
| `EXT_BYPASSER_TIMEOUT` | Timeout for page loading (in milliseconds)                  | `60000`                 |

**Compatibility:**  Works with resolvers that implement the FlareSolverr API schema.

## üèóÔ∏è Architecture

The application consists of a single service:

1.  **calibre-web-automated-bookdownloader:** Main application providing web interface and download functionality

## üè• Health Monitoring
