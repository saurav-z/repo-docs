#### Download Settings

| Variable               | Description                                               | Default Value                     |
| ---------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------- |
| `MAX_RETRY`            | Maximum retry attempts                                    | `3`                               |

| `AA_DONATOR_KEY`       | Optional Donator key for Anna's Archive fast download API | ``                                |
| `USE_BOOK_TITLE`       | Use book title as filename instead of ID                  | `false`                           |
| `PRIORITIZE_WELIB`     | When downloading, download from WELIB first instead of AA | `false`                           |

*   Set `BOOK_LANGUAGE` with comma-separated values like `en,fr,ru` for multiple language preferences.

#### AA Settings

| Variable               | Description                                               | Default Value                     |
| ---------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------- |
| `AA_BASE_URL`          | Base URL of Annas-Archive (could be changed for a proxy)  | `https://annas-archive.org`       |
| `USE_CF_BYPASS`        | Disable CF bypass and use alternative links instead       | `true`                            |

*   AA Donators can use their key in `AA_DONATOR_KEY` for faster downloads.
*   If disabling the cloudflare bypass, you will be using alternative download hosts, such as libgen or z-lib, but they usually have a delay before getting the more recent books and their collection is not as big as aa's. But this setting should work for the majority of books.

#### Network Settings

| Variable               | Description                     | Default Value           |
| ---------------------- | ------------------------------- | ----------------------- |
| `AA_ADDITIONAL_URLS`   | Proxy URLs for AA (, separated) | ``                      |
| `HTTP_PROXY`           | HTTP proxy URL                  | ``                      |
| `HTTPS_PROXY`          | HTTPS proxy URL                 | ``                      |
| `CUSTOM_DNS`           | Custom DNS IP                   | ``                      |
| `USE_DOH`              | Use DNS over HTTPS              | `false`                 |

*   Proxy settings: Use `HTTP_PROXY` and `HTTPS_PROXY` for basic or authenticated proxies.
*   `CUSTOM_DNS`: Configure custom DNS servers (comma-separated IPs) or use preset DNS providers: `google`, `quad9`, `cloudflare`, or `opendns`.  Use `USE_DOH=true` with a preset DNS provider to force DNS over HTTPS.

#### Custom Configuration

| Variable               | Description                                                 | Default Value           |
| ---------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------- |
| `CUSTOM_SCRIPT`        | Path to an executable script that tuns after each download  | ``                      |

*   Use `CUSTOM_SCRIPT` to run a custom script after each download for processing. The script receives the downloaded file path as an argument.

### Volume Configuration

```yaml
volumes:
  - /your/local/path:/cwa-book-ingest
  - /cwa/config/path/app.db:/auth/app.db:ro
```

*   **Note:** If your library volume is on a cifs share, you will get a "database locked" error until you add **nobrl** to your mount line in your fstab file.
*   Mount should align with your Calibre-Web-Automated ingest folder.

## Variants

### üßÖ Tor Variant

Use the Tor variant for enhanced privacy:

1.  Get the Tor-specific docker-compose file:

    ```bash
    curl -O https://raw.githubusercontent.com/calibrain/calibre-web-automated-book-downloader/refs/heads/main/docker-compose.tor.yml
    ```

2.  Start the service using this file:

    ```bash
    docker compose -f docker-compose.tor.yml up -d
    ```

**Important Considerations for Tor:**

*   This variant requires the `NET_ADMIN` and `NET_RAW` Docker capabilities.
*   Timezone is determined by the Tor exit node's IP.
*   Custom DNS, DoH, and proxy settings are ignored.

### External Cloudflare Resolver Variant

Use an external service to bypass Cloudflare protection.

#### Configuration

| Variable               | Description                                                 | Default Value           |
| ---------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------- |
| `EXT_BYPASSER_URL`     | The full URL of your external resolver (required)           |                         |
| `EXT_BYPASSER_PATH`    | API path for the resolver (usually `/v1`)                   | `/v1`                   |
| `EXT_BYPASSER_TIMEOUT` | Timeout for page loading (in milliseconds)                  | `60000`                 |

#### To use the External Cloudflare resolver variant:

1.  Get the extbp-specific docker-compose file:

    ```bash
    curl -O https://raw.githubusercontent.com/calibrain/calibre-web-automated-book-downloader/refs/heads/main/docker-compose.extbp.yml
    ```

2.  Start the service using this file:

    ```bash
    docker compose -f docker-compose.extbp.yml up -d
    ```

#### Compatibility:

This feature is designed to work with any resolver that implements the `FlareSolverr` API schema, including `ByParr` and similar projects.

#### Benefits:

- Centralizes Cloudflare bypass logic for easier maintenance.
- Can leverage more powerful or distributed resolver infrastructure.
- Reduces load on the main application container.

## üèóÔ∏è Architecture

*   The application consists of a single service:
    *   **calibre-web-automated-bookdownloader**: Main application providing web interface and download functionality

## üè• Health Monitoring

*   Built-in health checks monitor web interface availability, download service status, and Cloudflare bypass service connection. Checks run every 30 seconds with a 30-second timeout and 3 retries.

## üìù Logging

*   Logs are available in the container: `/var/logs/cwa-book-downloader.log` and via Docker logs.
