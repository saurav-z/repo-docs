*   Ensure your script preserves the original filename.
*   The file will be moved to `/cwa-book-ingest` after the script execution (if not deleted)

### Volume Configuration:

```yaml
volumes:
  - /your/local/path:/cwa-book-ingest
  - /cwa/config/path/app.db:/auth/app.db:ro
```

*   Ensure your local path aligns with your Calibre-Web-Automated ingest folder.
*   If using a CIFS share, add `nobrl` to your fstab mount option to prevent "database locked" errors.

## Tor Variant: Enhanced Privacy

*   Uses the Tor network for anonymized downloads.
*   Requires the `NET_ADMIN` and `NET_RAW` Docker capabilities.
*   Timezone is determined by the Tor exit node when running in Tor mode.
*   Custom DNS, DoH, and proxy settings are ignored in the Tor variant.
*   Get the `docker-compose.tor.yml` to use the Tor version.

    ```bash
    curl -O https://raw.githubusercontent.com/calibrain/calibre-web-automated-book-downloader/refs/heads/main/docker-compose.tor.yml
    ```

    ```bash
    docker compose -f docker-compose.tor.yml up -d
    ```

## External Cloudflare Resolver Variant:

*   Leverages an external service (like FlareSolverr or ByParr) to bypass Cloudflare.
*   Improves reliability and performance, especially with a dedicated resolver infrastructure.
*   Make sure to enable  `USE_CF_BYPASS` to enable this feature
*   Get the `docker-compose.extbp.yml` file to use the External Cloudflare resolver version.

    ```bash
    curl -O https://raw.githubusercontent.com/calibrain/calibre-web-automated-book-downloader/refs/heads/main/docker-compose.extbp.yml
    ```

    ```bash
    docker compose -f docker-compose.extbp.yml up -d
    ```

### Configuration

| Variable               | Description                                                 | Default Value           |
| ---------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------- |
| `EXT_BYPASSER_URL`     | The full URL of your external resolver (required)           |                         |
| `EXT_BYPASSER_PATH`    | API path for the resolver (usually `/v1`)                   | `/v1`                   |
| `EXT_BYPASSER_TIMEOUT` | Timeout for page loading (in milliseconds)                  | `60000`                 |
