| `INGEST_DIR`      | Book download directory | `/cwa-book-ingest` |
| `TZ`              | Container timezone      | `UTC`              |
| `UID`             | Runtime user ID         | `1000`             |
| `GID`             | Runtime group ID        | `100`              |
| `CWA_DB_PATH`     | Calibre-Web's database  | None               |
| `ENABLE_LOGGING`  | Enable log file         | `true`             |
| `LOG_LEVEL`       | Log level to use        | `info`             |

*If you wish to enable authentication, you must set `CWA_DB_PATH` to point to Calibre-Web's `app.db`, in order to match the username and password.*

*If logging is enabled, log folder default location is `/var/log/cwa-book-downloader`. Available log levels: `DEBUG`, `INFO`, `WARNING`, `ERROR`, `CRITICAL`. Higher levels show fewer messages.*

*Note that if using TOR, the TZ will be calculated automatically based on IP.*

#### Download Settings:

| Variable               | Description                                               | Default Value                     |
| ---------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------- |
| `MAX_RETRY`            | Maximum retry attempts                                    | `3`                               |

| `SUPPORTED_FORMATS`    | Supported book formats                                    | `epub,mobi,azw3,fb2,djvu,cbz,cbr` |
| `BOOK_LANGUAGE`        | Preferred language for books                              | `en`                              |
| `AA_DONATOR_KEY`       | Optional Donator key for Anna's Archive fast download API | ``                                |
| `USE_BOOK_TITLE`       | Use book title as filename instead of ID                  | `false`                           |
| `PRIORITIZE_WELIB`     | When downloading, download from WELIB first instead of AA | `false`                           |

*If you change `BOOK_LANGUAGE`, you can add multiple comma separated languages, such as `en,fr,ru` etc.*

#### AA

| Variable               | Description                                               | Default Value                     |
| ---------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------- |
| `AA_BASE_URL`          | Base URL of Annas-Archive (could be changed for a proxy)  | `https://annas-archive.org`       |
| `USE_CF_BYPASS`        | Disable CF bypass and use alternative links instead       | `true`                            |

*If you are a donator on AA, you can use your Key in `AA_DONATOR_KEY` to speed up downloads and bypass the wait times.*
*If disabling the cloudflare bypass, you will be using alternative download hosts, such as libgen or z-lib, but they usually have a delay before getting the more recent books and their collection is not as big as aa's. But this setting should work for the majority of books.*

#### Network Settings:

| Variable               | Description                     | Default Value           |
| ---------------------- | ------------------------------- | ----------------------- |
| `AA_ADDITIONAL_URLS`   | Proxy URLs for AA (, separated) | ``                      |
| `HTTP_PROXY`           | HTTP proxy URL                  | ``                      |
| `HTTPS_PROXY`          | HTTPS proxy URL                 | ``                      |
| `CUSTOM_DNS`           | Custom DNS IP                   | ``                      |
| `USE_DOH`              | Use DNS over HTTPS              | `false`                 |

*For proxy configuration, you can specify URLs in the following format:*

```bash
# Basic proxy
HTTP_PROXY=http://proxy.example.com:8080
HTTPS_PROXY=http://proxy.example.com:8080

# Proxy with authentication
HTTP_PROXY=http://username:password@proxy.example.com:8080
HTTPS_PROXY=http://username:password@proxy.example.com:8080
```

*The `CUSTOM_DNS` setting supports two formats:*

1.  **Custom DNS Servers**: A comma-separated list of DNS server IP addresses
    *   Example: `127.0.0.53,127.0.1.53` (useful for PiHole)
    *   Supports both IPv4 and IPv6 addresses in the same string
2.  **Preset DNS Providers**: Use one of these predefined options:
    *   `google` - Google DNS
    *   `quad9` - Quad9 DNS
    *   `cloudflare` - Cloudflare DNS
    *   `opendns` - OpenDNS

*For users experiencing ISP-level website blocks (such as Virgin Media in the UK), using alternative DNS providers like Cloudflare may help bypass these restrictions*

*If a `CUSTOM_DNS` is specified from the preset providers, you can also set a `USE_DOH=true` to force using DNS over HTTPS, which might also help in certain network situations. Note that only `google`, `quad9`, `cloudflare` and `opendns` are supported for now, and any other value in `CUSTOM_DNS` will make the `USE_DOH` flag ignored.*

*Try something like this :*

```bash
CUSTOM_DNS=cloudflare
USE_DOH=true
```

#### Custom configuration

| Variable               | Description                                                 | Default Value           |
| ---------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------- |
| `CUSTOM_SCRIPT`        | Path to an executable script that tuns after each download  | ``                      |

*If `CUSTOM_SCRIPT` is set, it will be executed after each successful download but before the file is moved to the ingest directory. This allows for custom processing like format conversion or validation.*

*The script is called with the full path of the downloaded file as its argument. Important notes:*

*   *The script must preserve the original filename for proper processing*
*   *The file can be modified or even deleted if needed*
*   *The file will be moved to `/cwa-book-ingest` after the script execution (if not deleted)*

*You can specify these configuration in this format :*

```
environment:
  - CUSTOM_SCRIPT=/scripts/process-book.sh

volumes:
  - local/scripts/custom_script.sh:/scripts/process-book.sh
```

### Volume Configuration

```yaml
volumes:
  - /your/local/path:/cwa-book-ingest
  - /cwa/config/path/app.db:/auth/app.db:ro
```

**Note** - If your library volume is on a cifs share, you will get a "database locked" error until you add **nobrl** to your mount line in your fstab file. e.g. //192.168.1.1/Books /media/books cifs credentials=.smbcredentials,uid=1000,gid=1000,iocharset=utf8,**nobrl** - See https://github.com/crocodilestick/Calibre-Web-Automated/issues/64#issuecomment-2712769777

Mount should align with your Calibre-Web-Automated ingest folder.

## Variants:

### üßÖ Tor Variant

This application also offers a variant that routes all its traffic through the Tor network. This can be useful for enhanced privacy or bypassing network restrictions.

To use the Tor variant:

1.  Get the Tor-specific docker-compose file:
    ```bash
    curl -O https://raw.githubusercontent.com/calibrain/calibre-web-automated-book-downloader/refs/heads/main/docker-compose.tor.yml
    ```
2.  Start the service using this file:
    ```bash
    docker compose -f docker-compose.tor.yml up -d
    ```

**Important Considerations for Tor:**

*   **Capabilities:** This variant requires the `NET_ADMIN` and `NET_RAW` Docker capabilities to configure `iptables` for transparent Tor proxying.
*   **Timezone:** When running in Tor mode, the container will attempt to determine the timezone based on the Tor exit node's IP address and set it automatically. This will override the `TZ` environment variable if it is set.
*   **Network Settings:** Custom DNS, DoH, and HTTP(S) proxy settings (`CUSTOM_DNS`, `USE_DOH`, `HTTP_PROXY`, `HTTPS_PROXY`) are ignored when using the Tor variant, as all traffic goes through Tor.

### External Cloudflare resolver variant

This variant allows the application to use an external service to bypass Cloudflare protection, instead of relying on the built-in bypasser. This is useful if you already have a dedicated Cloudflare resolver (such as [FlareSolverr](https://github.com/FlareSolverr/FlareSolverr) or compatible services like [ByParr](https://github.com/ThePhaseless/Byparr)) running elsewhere.

#### How it works:

- When enabled, all requests that require Cloudflare bypass are sent to your external resolver service.
- The application communicates with the resolver using its API.
- This approach can improve reliability and performance, especially if your external resolver is optimized or shared across multiple applications.

#### Configuration

| Variable               | Description                                                 | Default Value           |
| ---------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------- |
| `EXT_BYPASSER_URL`     | The full URL of your external resolver (required)           |                         |
| `EXT_BYPASSER_PATH`    | API path for the resolver (usually `/v1`)                   | `/v1`                   |
| `EXT_BYPASSER_TIMEOUT` | Timeout for page loading (in milliseconds)                  | `60000`                 |

#### Important

This feature follows the same configuration of the built-in Cloudflare bypasser, so you should turn on the `USE_CF_BYPASS` configuration to enable it.

#### To use the External Cloudflare resolver variant:

1.  Get the extbp-specific docker-compose file:
    ```bash
    curl -O https://raw.githubusercontent.com/calibrain/calibre-web-automated-book-downloader/refs/heads/main/docker-compose.extbp.yml
    ```
2.  Start the service using this file:
    ```bash
    docker compose -f docker-compose.extbp.yml up -d
    ```

#### Compatibility:

This feature is designed to work with any resolver that implements the `FlareSolverr` API schema, including `ByParr` and similar projects.

#### Benefits:

-   Centralizes Cloudflare bypass logic for easier maintenance.
-   Can leverage more powerful or distributed resolver infrastructure.
-   Reduces load on the main application container.

## Architecture:

The application consists of a single service:

1.  **calibre-web-automated-bookdownloader**: Main application providing web interface and download functionality

## Health Monitoring:

Built-in health checks monitor:

*   Web interface availability
*   Download service status
*   Cloudflare bypass service connection

Checks run every 30 seconds with a 30-second timeout and 3 retries. You can enable by adding this to your compose :

```
HEALTHCHECK --interval=30s --timeout=30s --start-period=5s --retries=3 \
    CMD pyrequests http://localhost:8084/request/api/status || exit 1
```

## Logging:

Logs are available in:

*   Container: `/var/logs/cwa-book-downloader.log`
*   Docker logs: Access via `docker logs`
