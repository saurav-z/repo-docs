### Development Workflow

```bash
/cleanproject                    # Remove debug artifacts with git safety
/commit                          # Smart conventional commits with analysis
/format                          # Auto-detect and apply project formatter
/scaffold feature-name           # Generate complete features from patterns
/test                            # Run tests with intelligent failure analysis
/implement url/path/feature      # Import and adapt code from any source with validation phase
/refactor                        # Intelligent code restructuring with validation & de-para mapping
```

### Code Quality & Security

```bash
/review                # Multi-agent analysis (security, performance, quality, architecture)
/security-scan         # Vulnerability analysis with extended thinking & remediation tracking
/predict-issues        # Proactive problem detection with timeline estimates
/remove-comments       # Clean obvious comments, preserve valuable docs
/fix-imports           # Repair broken imports after refactoring
/find-todos            # Locate and organize development tasks
/create-todos          # Add contextual TODO comments based on analysis results
/fix-todos             # Intelligently implement TODO fixes with context
```

### Advanced Analysis

```bash
/understand            # Analyze entire project architecture and patterns
/explain-like-senior   # Senior-level code explanations with context
/contributing          # Complete contribution readiness analysis
/make-it-pretty        # Improve readability without functional changes
```

### Session & Project Management

```bash
/session-start         # Begin documented sessions with CLAUDE.md integration
/session-end           # Summarize and preserve session context
/docs                  # Smart documentation management and updates
/todos-to-issues       # Convert code TODOs to GitHub issues
/undo                  # Safe rollback with git checkpoint restore
```

## How It Works

CCPlugins leverages Claude Code CLI's native capabilities to provide intelligent development assistance. Commands utilize intelligent instructions, native tool integration, and safety-first design principles.

### Execution Flow

1.  **Command Loading**: Claude reads the markdown definition from `~/.claude/commands/`
2.  **Context Analysis**: Analyzes your project structure, technology stack, and current state
3.  **Intelligent Planning**: Creates execution strategy based on your specific situation
4.  **Safe Execution**: Performs actions with automatic checkpoints and validation
5.  **Clear Feedback**: Provides results, next steps, and any warnings

## Performance Metrics

| Task | Manual Time | With CCPlugins | Time Saved |
|------|-------------|----------------|------------|
| Security analysis | 45-60 min | 3-5 min | ~50 min |
| Architecture review | 30-45 min | 5-8 min | ~35 min |
| Feature scaffolding | 25-40 min | 2-3 min | ~30 min |
| Git commits | 5-10 min | 30 sec | ~9 min |
| Code cleanup | 20-30 min | 1 min | ~25 min |
| Import fixing | 15-25 min | 1-2 min | ~20 min |
| Code review | 20-30 min | 2-4 min | ~20 min |
| Issue prediction | 60+ min | 5-10 min | ~50 min |
| TODO resolution | 30-45 min | 3-5 min | ~35 min |
| Code adaptation | 40-60 min | 3-5 min | ~45 min |

**Save an estimated 4-5 hours per week with professional-grade analysis!**

## Requirements

*   Claude Code CLI
*   Python 3.6+ (for installer)
*   Git (for version control commands)

## Advanced Usage

### Creating Custom Commands

Create your own commands by adding markdown files to `~/.claude/commands/`:

```markdown
# My Custom Command

I'll help you with your specific workflow.

[Your instructions here]
```

### Using Arguments
Commands support arguments via `$ARGUMENTS`:

```bash
/mycommand some-file.js
# $ARGUMENTS will contain "some-file.js"
```

### CI/CD Integration
Use commands in automated workflows:

```bash
# Quality pipeline
claude "/security-scan" && claude "/review" && claude "/test"

# Pre-commit validation  
claude "/format" && claude "/commit"

# Feature development
claude "/scaffold api-users" && claude "/test"

# Complete workflow
claude "/security-scan" && claude "/create-todos" && claude "/todos-to-issues"

# TODO resolution workflow
claude "/find-todos" && claude "/fix-todos" && claude "/test"
```

### Manual Workflow Integration
Perfect for development routines:

```bash
# Morning routine
claude "/session-start"
claude "/security-scan"

# During development
claude "/scaffold user-management"
claude "/review" 
claude "/format"

# End of day
claude "/commit"
claude "/session-end"
```

## Security & Git Instructions

All commands that interact with git include security instructions to prevent AI attribution:

**Commands with git protection:**
- `/commit`, `/scaffold`, `/make-it-pretty`, `/cleanproject`, `/fix-imports`, `/review`, `/security-scan`
- `/contributing`, `/todos-to-issues`, `/predict-issues`, `/find-todos`, `/create-todos`, `/fix-todos`

These commands will NEVER:
- Add "Co-authored-by" or AI signatures
- Include "Generated with Claude Code" messages
- Modify git config or credentials
- Add AI attribution to commits/issues

You can modify these instructions in individual command files if needed.
