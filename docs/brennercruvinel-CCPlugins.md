### üöÄ Development Workflow

```bash
/cleanproject                    # Remove debug artifacts with git safety
/commit                          # Smart conventional commits with analysis
/format                          # Auto-detect and apply project formatter
/scaffold feature-name           # Generate complete features from patterns
/test                            # Run tests with intelligent failure analysis
/implement url/path/feature      # Import and adapt code from any source with validation phase
/refactor                        # Intelligent code restructuring with validation & de-para mapping
```

### üõ°Ô∏è Code Quality & Security

```bash
/review                # Multi-agent analysis (security, performance, quality, architecture)
/security-scan         # Vulnerability analysis with extended thinking & remediation tracking
/predict-issues        # Proactive problem detection with timeline estimates
/remove-comments       # Clean obvious comments, preserve valuable docs
/fix-imports           # Repair broken imports after refactoring
/find-todos            # Locate and organize development tasks
/create-todos          # Add contextual TODO comments based on analysis results
/fix-todos             # Intelligently implement TODO fixes with context
```

### üîç Advanced Analysis

```bash
/understand            # Analyze entire project architecture and patterns
/explain-like-senior   # Senior-level code explanations with context
/contributing          # Complete contribution readiness analysis
/make-it-pretty        # Improve readability without functional changes
```

### üìã Session & Project Management

```bash
/session-start         # Begin documented sessions with CLAUDE.md integration
/session-end           # Summarize and preserve session context
/docs                  # Smart documentation management and updates
/todos-to-issues       # Convert code TODOs to GitHub issues
/undo                  # Safe rollback with git checkpoint restore
```

## How It Works

CCPlugins utilizes a sophisticated architecture to transform Claude Code CLI into a powerful development assistant.  The developer interacts with a command, which is processed by Claude Code CLI and executed with clear feedback and results.  Key components include:

*   **Intelligent Instructions:** First-person conversational design enhances collaborative reasoning.
*   **Native Tool Integration:** Utilizes Claude Code CLI's built-in tools (Grep, Glob, Read, Write, etc.) for efficiency.
*   **Safety-First Design:**  Automatic git checkpoints, session persistence, and rollback capabilities.
*   **Universal Compatibility:** Framework-agnostic with intelligent auto-detection for broad applicability.

## Real-World Example

### Before `/cleanproject`:
```
src/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ UserService.js
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ UserService.test.js
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ UserService_backup.js    # Old version
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ debug.log               # Debug output
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ test_temp.js           # Temporary test
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ notes.txt              # Dev notes
```

### After `/cleanproject`:
```
src/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ UserService.js          # Clean production code
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ UserService.test.js     # Actual tests preserved
```

## Performance Metrics

## Advanced Usage

### Creating Custom Commands
Create your own commands by adding markdown files to `~/.claude/commands/`:

```markdown
# My Custom Command

I'll help you with your specific workflow.

[Your instructions here]
```

### Using Arguments
Commands support arguments via `$ARGUMENTS`:

```bash
/mycommand some-file.js
# $ARGUMENTS will contain "some-file.js"
```

### CI/CD Integration
Use commands in automated workflows:

```bash
# Quality pipeline
claude "/security-scan" && claude "/review" && claude "/test"

# Pre-commit validation  
claude "/format" && claude "/commit"

# Feature development
claude "/scaffold api-users" && claude "/test"

# Complete workflow
claude "/security-scan" && claude "/create-todos" && claude "/todos-to-issues"

# TODO resolution workflow
claude "/find-todos" && claude "/fix-todos" && claude "/test"
```

### Manual Workflow Integration
Perfect for development routines:

```bash
# Morning routine
claude "/session-start"
claude "/security-scan"

# During development
claude "/scaffold user-management"
claude "/review" 
claude "/format"

# End of day
claude "/commit"
claude "/session-end"
```

## Security & Git Instructions

All commands that interact with git include security instructions to prevent AI attribution:

**Commands with git protection:**
- `/commit`, `/scaffold`, `/make-it-pretty`, `/cleanproject`, `/fix-imports`, `/review`, `/security-scan`
- `/contributing`, `/todos-to-issues`, `/predict-issues`, `/find-todos`, `/create-todos`, `/fix-todos`

These commands will NEVER:
- Add "Co-authored-by" or AI signatures
- Include "Generated with Claude Code" messages
- Modify git config or credentials
- Add AI attribution to commits/issues

You can modify these instructions in individual command files if needed.
