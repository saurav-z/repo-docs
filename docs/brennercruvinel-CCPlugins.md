Create your own commands by adding markdown files to `~/.claude/commands/`:

```markdown
# My Custom Command

I'll help you with your specific workflow.

[Your instructions here]
```

### Using Arguments
Commands support arguments via `$ARGUMENTS`:

```bash
/mycommand some-file.js
# $ARGUMENTS will contain "some-file.js"
```

### CI/CD Integration
Use commands in automated workflows:

```bash
# Quality pipeline
claude "/security-scan" && claude "/review" && claude "/test"

# Pre-commit validation  
claude "/format" && claude "/commit"

# Feature development
claude "/scaffold api-users" && claude "/test"

# Complete workflow
claude "/security-scan" && claude "/create-todos" && claude "/todos-to-issues"

# TODO resolution workflow
claude "/find-todos" && claude "/fix-todos" && claude "/test"
```

### Manual Workflow Integration
Perfect for development routines:

```bash
# Morning routine
claude "/session-start"
claude "/security-scan"

# During development
claude "/scaffold user-management"
claude "/review" 
claude "/format"

# End of day
claude "/commit"
claude "/session-end"
```

## Security & Git Instructions

All commands that interact with git include security instructions to prevent AI attribution:

**Commands with git protection:**
- `/commit`, `/scaffold`, `/make-it-pretty`, `/cleanproject`, `/fix-imports`, `/review`, `/security-scan`
- `/contributing`, `/todos-to-issues`, `/predict-issues`, `/find-todos`, `/create-todos`, `/fix-todos`

These commands will NEVER:
- Add "Co-authored-by" or AI signatures
- Include "Generated with Claude Code" messages
- Modify git config or credentials
- Add AI attribution to commits/issues

You can modify these instructions in individual command files if needed.
