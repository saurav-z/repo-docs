## Enhanced Features

### Validation and Refinement

Complex commands now include validation phases to ensure completeness:

*   `/refactor validate` - Verify 100% migration.
*   `/implement validate` - Check integration completeness, find loose ends.

### Extended Thinking

Advanced analysis for complex scenarios:

*   **Refactoring:** Deep architectural analysis for large-scale changes
*   **Security:** Sophisticated vulnerability detection with chain analysis

### Pragmatic Command Integration

Natural workflow suggestions without over-engineering:

*   Suggests `/test` after major changes
*   Recommends `/commit` at logical checkpoints
*   Maintains user control, no automatic execution

## How It Works

CCPlugins extends Claude Code CLI by providing a curated set of commands that leverage AI for automated tasks. The system is designed for safety, incorporating git checkpoints before any potentially destructive operation. Commands have validation phases to ensure complete, high quality results.

## Technical Architecture

### Core Components

*   **Intelligent Instructions**: First-person conversational design activates Claude's collaborative reasoning
*   **Native Tool Integration**: Integration with Claude Code CLIâ€™s native tools like grep, glob, read, and write.
*   **Safety-First Design**: Automatic Git checkpoints before destructive operations
*   **Universal Compatibility**: Framework-agnostic with intelligent auto-detection

### Advanced Features

*   **Session Continuity**: Persisting state across multiple sessions for continuity
*   **Multi-Agent Architecture**: Orchestrating specialized sub-agents for various analysis types.
*   **Performance Optimizations**: Smart caching and incremental processing to improve efficiency

## Requirements

*   Claude Code CLI
*   Python 3.6+ (for installer)
*   Git (for version control commands)

## Security & Git Instructions

All commands that interact with git include security instructions to prevent AI attribution:

**Commands with git protection:**
- `/commit`, `/scaffold`, `/make-it-pretty`, `/cleanproject`, `/fix-imports`, `/review`, `/security-scan`
- `/contributing`, `/todos-to-issues`, `/predict-issues`, `/find-todos`, `/create-todos`, `/fix-todos`

These commands will NEVER:
- Add "Co-authored-by" or AI signatures
- Include "Generated with Claude Code" messages
- Modify git config or credentials
- Add AI attribution to commits/issues

You can modify these instructions in individual command files if needed.
