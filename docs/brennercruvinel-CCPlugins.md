```bash
# Quality pipeline
claude "/security-scan" && claude "/review" && claude "/test"

# Pre-commit validation
claude "/format" && claude "/commit"

# Feature development
claude "/scaffold api-users" && claude "/test"

# Complete workflow
claude "/security-scan" && claude "/create-todos" && claude "/todos-to-issues"

# TODO resolution workflow
claude "/find-todos" && claude "/fix-todos" && claude "/test"
```

### Manual Workflow Integration

Perfect for development routines:

```bash
# Morning routine
claude "/session-start"
claude "/security-scan"

# During development
claude "/scaffold user-management"
claude "/review"
claude "/format"

# End of day
