## Commands

CCPlugins provides 24 professional commands to optimize your workflow:

### üöÄ Development Workflow

*   `/cleanproject`: Remove debug artifacts with git safety
*   `/commit`: Smart conventional commits with analysis
*   `/format`: Auto-detect and apply project formatter
*   `/scaffold feature-name`: Generate complete features from patterns
*   `/test`: Run tests with intelligent failure analysis
*   `/implement url/path/feature`: Import and adapt code from any source with validation phase
*   `/refactor`: Intelligent code restructuring with validation & de-para mapping

### üõ°Ô∏è Code Quality & Security

*   `/review`: Multi-agent analysis (security, performance, quality, architecture)
*   `/security-scan`: Vulnerability analysis with extended thinking & remediation tracking
*   `/predict-issues`: Proactive problem detection with timeline estimates
*   `/remove-comments`: Clean obvious comments, preserve valuable docs
*   `/fix-imports`: Repair broken imports after refactoring
*   `/find-todos`: Locate and organize development tasks
*   `/create-todos`: Add contextual TODO comments based on analysis results
*   `/fix-todos`: Intelligently implement TODO fixes with context

### üîç Advanced Analysis

*   `/understand`: Analyze entire project architecture and patterns
*   `/explain-like-senior`: Senior-level code explanations with context
*   `/contributing`: Complete contribution readiness analysis
*   `/make-it-pretty`: Improve readability without functional changes

### üìã Session & Project Management

*   `/session-end`: Summarize and preserve session context
*   `/docs`: Smart documentation management and updates
*   `/todos-to-issues`: Convert code TODOs to GitHub issues
*   `/undo`: Safe rollback with git checkpoint restore

## How It Works

CCPlugins extends Claude Code CLI's capabilities with an intelligent development assistant. This is achieved through a sophisticated yet elegant architecture:

1.  **Command Loading:** Claude reads the markdown definition from `~/.claude/commands/`.
2.  **Context Analysis:** Analyzes your project structure, technology stack, and current state.
3.  **Intelligent Planning:** Creates an execution strategy based on your specific situation.
4.  **Safe Execution:** Performs actions with automatic checkpoints and validation.
5.  **Clear Feedback:** Provides results, next steps, and any warnings.

## Advanced Features

### Validation & Refinement

Complex commands now include validation phases:

*   `/refactor validate`: Find remaining old patterns, verify 100% migration
*   `/implement validate`: Check integration completeness, find loose ends

### Extended Thinking

Advanced analysis for complex scenarios:

*   **Refactoring**: Deep architectural analysis for large-scale changes
*   **Security**: Sophisticated vulnerability detection with chain analysis

### Pragmatic Command Integration

Natural workflow suggestions without over-engineering:

*   Suggests `/test` after major changes
*   Recommends `/commit` at logical checkpoints
*   Maintains user control, no automatic execution

## Real World Example

### Before `/cleanproject`:

```
src/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ UserService.js
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ UserService.test.js
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ UserService_backup.js    # Old version
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ debug.log               # Debug output
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ test_temp.js           # Temporary test
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ notes.txt              # Dev notes
```

### After `/cleanproject`:

```
src/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ UserService.js          # Clean production code
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ UserService.test.js     # Actual tests preserved
```

## Advanced Usage

### Creating Custom Commands

Create your own commands by adding markdown files to `~/.claude/commands/`:

```markdown
# My Custom Command

I'll help you with your specific workflow.

[Your instructions here]
```

### Using Arguments

Commands support arguments via `$ARGUMENTS`:

```bash
/mycommand some-file.js
# $ARGUMENTS will contain "some-file.js"
```

### CI/CD Integration

Use commands in automated workflows:

```bash
# Quality pipeline
claude "/security-scan" && claude "/review" && claude "/test"

# Pre-commit validation
claude "/format" && claude "/commit"

# Feature development
claude "/scaffold api-users" && claude "/test"

# Complete workflow
claude "/security-scan" && claude "/create-todos" && claude "/todos-to-issues"

# TODO resolution workflow
claude "/find-todos" && claude "/fix-todos" && claude "/test"
```

### Manual Workflow Integration

Perfect for development routines:

```bash
# Morning routine
claude "/session-start"
claude "/security-scan"

# During development
claude "/scaffold user-management"
claude "/review"
claude "/format"

# End of day
claude "/commit"
claude "/session-end"
```

## Security & Git Instructions

All commands that interact with git include security instructions to prevent AI attribution:

**Commands with git protection:**

*   `/commit`, `/scaffold`, `/make-it-pretty`, `/cleanproject`, `/fix-imports`, `/review`, `/security-scan`
*   `/contributing`, `/todos-to-issues`, `/predict-issues`, `/find-todos`, `/create-todos`, `/fix-todos`

These commands will NEVER:

*   Add "Co-authored-by" or AI signatures
*   Include "Generated with Claude Code" messages
*   Modify git config or credentials
*   Add AI attribution to commits/issues

You can modify these instructions in individual command files if needed.
