/scaffold feature-name           # Generate complete features from patterns
/test                            # Run tests with intelligent failure analysis
/implement url/path/feature      # Import and adapt code from any source with validation phase
/refactor                        # Intelligent code restructuring with validation & de-para mapping
```

### üõ°Ô∏è Code Quality & Security

```bash
/review                # Multi-agent analysis (security, performance, quality, architecture)
/security-scan         # Vulnerability analysis with extended thinking & remediation tracking
/predict-issues        # Proactive problem detection with timeline estimates
/remove-comments       # Clean obvious comments, preserve valuable docs
/fix-imports           # Repair broken imports after refactoring
/find-todos            # Locate and organize development tasks
/create-todos          # Add contextual TODO comments based on analysis results
/fix-todos             # Intelligently implement TODO fixes with context
```

### üîç Advanced Analysis

```bash
/understand            # Analyze entire project architecture and patterns
/explain-like-senior   # Senior-level code explanations with context
/contributing          # Complete contribution readiness analysis
/make-it-pretty        # Improve readability without functional changes
```

### üìã Session & Project Management

```bash
/session-start         # Begin documented sessions with CLAUDE.md integration
/session-end           # Summarize and preserve session context
/docs                  # Smart documentation management and updates
/todos-to-issues       # Convert code TODOs to GitHub issues
/undo                  # Safe rollback with git checkpoint restore
```

## Enhanced Features

*   **Validation & Refinement:** Ensures completeness and accuracy in key commands.
*   **Extended Thinking:** Utilizes advanced analysis for complex scenarios.
*   **Pragmatic Command Integration:** Provides natural workflow suggestions.

## Real-World Example

### Before `/cleanproject`:

```
src/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ UserService.js
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ UserService.test.js
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ UserService_backup.js    # Old version
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ debug.log               # Debug output
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ test_temp.js           # Temporary test
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ notes.txt              # Dev notes
```

### After `/cleanproject`:

```
src/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ UserService.js          # Clean production code
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ UserService.test.js     # Actual tests preserved
```

## How It Works

CCPlugins enhances Claude Code CLI through an architecture designed for developer productivity.

**Execution Flow**
When a command is typed:
1.  **Command Loading**: Claude reads the markdown definition from `~/.claude/commands/`
2.  **Context Analysis**: Analyzes your project structure, technology stack, and current state
3.  **Intelligent Planning**: Creates execution strategy based on your specific situation
4.  **Safe Execution**: Performs actions with automatic checkpoints and validation
5.  **Clear Feedback**: Provides results, next steps, and any warnings

## Technical Notes

*   **Design Philosophy:** Emphasizes simplicity, context awareness, and safety.
*   **Native Tool Integration:** Leverages Claude Code CLI's built-in tools.
*   **Security-First Design:** Includes git checkpoints.
*   **Conversational Interface:** Uses first-person language for improved model performance.
