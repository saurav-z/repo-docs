### üöÄ Development Workflow

```bash
/cleanproject                    # Remove debug artifacts with git safety
/commit                          # Smart conventional commits with analysis
/format                          # Auto-detect and apply project formatter
/scaffold feature-name           # Generate complete features from patterns
/test                            # Run tests with intelligent failure analysis
/implement url/path/feature      # Import and adapt code from any source with validation phase
/refactor                        # Intelligent code restructuring with validation & de-para mapping
```

### üõ°Ô∏è Code Quality & Security

```bash
/review                # Multi-agent analysis (security, performance, quality, architecture)
/security-scan         # Vulnerability analysis with extended thinking & remediation tracking
/predict-issues        # Proactive problem detection with timeline estimates
/remove-comments       # Clean obvious comments, preserve valuable docs
/fix-imports           # Repair broken imports after refactoring
/find-todos            # Locate and organize development tasks
/create-todos          # Add contextual TODO comments based on analysis results
/fix-todos             # Intelligently implement TODO fixes with context
```

### üîç Advanced Analysis

```bash
/understand            # Analyze entire project architecture and patterns
/explain-like-senior   # Senior-level code explanations with context
/contributing          # Complete contribution readiness analysis
/make-it-pretty        # Improve readability without functional changes
```

### üìã Session & Project Management

```bash
/session-start         # Begin documented sessions with CLAUDE.md integration
/session-end           # Summarize and preserve session context
/docs                  # Smart documentation management and updates
/todos-to-issues       # Convert code TODOs to GitHub issues
/undo                  # Safe rollback with git checkpoint restore
```

## How It Works

CCPlugins leverages Claude Code CLI's capabilities, using intelligent instructions and native tool integration.  It ensures safety with git checkpoints and framework-agnostic compatibility.

## Real-World Example

**Before `/cleanproject`:** (messy project structure)

**After `/cleanproject`:** (clean project structure)

*(Refer to original README for more details on example.)*
