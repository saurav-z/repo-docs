*   **Command Overview:**

    ### üöÄ Development Workflow

    ```bash
    /cleanproject                    # Remove debug artifacts with git safety
    /commit                          # Smart conventional commits with analysis
    /format                          # Auto-detect and apply project formatter
    /scaffold feature-name           # Generate complete features from patterns
    /test                            # Run tests with intelligent failure analysis
    /implement url/path/feature      # Import and adapt code from any source with validation phase
    /refactor                        # Intelligent code restructuring with validation & de-para mapping
    ```

    ### üõ°Ô∏è Code Quality & Security

    ```bash
    /review                # Multi-agent analysis (security, performance, quality, architecture)
    /security-scan         # Vulnerability analysis with extended thinking & remediation tracking
    /predict-issues        # Proactive problem detection with timeline estimates
    /remove-comments       # Clean obvious comments, preserve valuable docs
    /fix-imports           # Repair broken imports after refactoring
    /find-todos            # Locate and organize development tasks
    /create-todos          # Add contextual TODO comments based on analysis results
    /fix-todos             # Intelligently implement TODO fixes with context
    ```

    ### üîç Advanced Analysis

    ```bash
    /understand            # Analyze entire project architecture and patterns
    /explain-like-senior   # Senior-level code explanations with context
    /contributing          # Complete contribution readiness analysis
    /make-it-pretty        # Improve readability without functional changes
    ```

    ### üìã Session & Project Management

    ```bash
    /session-start         # Begin documented sessions with CLAUDE.md integration
    /session-end           # Summarize and preserve session context
    /docs                  # Smart documentation management and updates
    /todos-to-issues       # Convert code TODOs to GitHub issues
    /undo                  # Safe rollback with git checkpoint restore
    ```
