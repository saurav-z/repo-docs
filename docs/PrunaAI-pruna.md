Pruna is available for Linux, macOS, and Windows.

**Prerequisites:**

*   Python 3.9 or higher
*   Optional: CUDA toolkit for GPU support (recommended)

**Installation Options:**

1.  **Install from PyPI:**
    ```bash
    pip install pruna
    ```

2.  **Install from Source:**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/pruna-ai/pruna.git
    cd pruna
    pip install -e .
    ```

## Quick Start

Optimize your models with ease using Pruna.

1.  **Load a Pre-trained Model:**

    ```python
    from diffusers import StableDiffusionPipeline
    base_model = StableDiffusionPipeline.from_pretrained("stable-diffusion-v1-5/stable-diffusion-v1-5")
    ```

2.  **Use the `smash` function:**

    ```python
    from pruna import smash, SmashConfig

    smash_config = SmashConfig()
    smash_config["cacher"] = "deepcache"
    smash_config["compiler"] = "stable_fast"
    smashed_model = smash(model=base_model, smash_config=smash_config)
    ```

3.  **Use the optimized model**

    ```python
    smashed_model("An image of a cute prune.").images[0]
    ```

4.  **Evaluate the Performance**

    ```python
    from pruna.evaluation.task import Task
    from pruna.evaluation.evaluation_agent import EvaluationAgent
    from pruna.data.pruna_datamodule import PrunaDataModule

    datamodule = PrunaDataModule.from_string("LAION256")
    datamodule.limit_datasets(10)
    task = Task("image_generation_quality", datamodule=datamodule)
    eval_agent = EvaluationAgent(task)
    eval_agent.evaluate(smashed_model)
    ```
