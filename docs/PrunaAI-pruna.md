*   **Simplified Integration:** Optimize your models with just a few lines of code.
*   **Pruna Pro:**  Unlock advanced optimization features and priority support with our enterprise solution.

## Introduction

Pruna is a powerful model optimization framework designed to help developers create faster, more efficient, and sustainable AI models with minimal effort.  By leveraging a suite of cutting-edge compression algorithms, Pruna allows you to drastically improve your models' performance across several key areas:

*   **Faster Inference:** Accelerate model execution through advanced optimization techniques.
*   **Reduced Model Size:** Minimize storage requirements while preserving accuracy.
*   **Lower Costs:** Decrease computational expenses and resource demands.
*   **Greener AI:** Reduce energy consumption and environmental impact.

Pruna's design emphasizes ease of use, requiring only a few lines of code to apply powerful optimizations. It supports a wide range of model types, including Large Language Models (LLMs), Diffusion Models, Vision Transformers, and speech recognition models.

For advanced features, explore [Pruna Pro](https://docs.pruna.ai/en/stable/docs_pruna_pro/user_manual/pruna_pro.html), our enterprise solution, to unlock enhanced capabilities and support.

## Installation

Pruna is compatible with Linux, macOS, and Windows.  Ensure you have Python 3.9 or higher and optionally, the [CUDA toolkit](https://docs.nvidia.com/cuda/cuda-installation-guide-linux/) for GPU support.

**Installation Methods:**

1.  **Install via pip:**

    ```bash
    pip install pruna
    ```

2.  **Install from Source:**

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/PrunaAI/pruna.git
    cd pruna
    pip install -e .
    ```

## Quick Start

Get started with Pruna in three simple steps:

1.  **Load a Pre-trained Model:**

    ```python
    from diffusers import StableDiffusionPipeline
    base_model = StableDiffusionPipeline.from_pretrained("stable-diffusion-v1-5/stable-diffusion-v1-5")
    ```

2.  **Optimize with `smash`:**

    ```python
    from pruna import smash, SmashConfig

    smash_config = SmashConfig()
    smash_config["cacher"] = "deepcache"
    smash_config["compiler"] = "stable_fast"
    smashed_model = smash(model=base_model, smash_config=smash_config)
    ```

3.  **Use the Optimized Model:**

    ```python
    smashed_model("An image of a cute prune.").images[0]
    ```

You can also evaluate the performance:

```python
from pruna.evaluation.task import Task
from pruna.evaluation.evaluation_agent import EvaluationAgent
from pruna.data.pruna_datamodule import PrunaDataModule

datamodule = PrunaDataModule.from_string("LAION256")
datamodule.limit_datasets(10)
task = Task("image_generation_quality", datamodule=datamodule)
eval_agent = EvaluationAgent(task)
eval_agent.evaluate(smashed_model)
```
