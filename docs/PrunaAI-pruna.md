## Optimize Your AI Models with Pruna

Pruna is a powerful model optimization framework designed to make AI models faster, cheaper, smaller, and more environmentally friendly. This open-source tool empowers developers to significantly improve the performance and efficiency of their AI models with minimal code changes.  [Visit the Pruna GitHub repository to get started.](https://github.com/PrunaAI/pruna)

**Key Features:**

*   **Faster Inference:** Accelerate model performance using advanced optimization techniques.
*   **Smaller Model Sizes:** Reduce model size while maintaining quality.
*   **Reduced Costs:** Lower computational expenses and resource needs.
*   **Greener AI:** Minimize energy consumption and reduce environmental impact.
*   **Comprehensive Optimization Techniques:** Includes caching, quantization, pruning, distillation, and compilation.
*   **Easy Integration:** Designed for simple integration with existing models.
*   **Broad Model Support:** Compatible with LLMs, Diffusion Models, Vision Transformers, Speech Recognition models, and more.

## Installation

Pruna is available for installation on Linux, MacOS, and Windows.

**Prerequisites:**

*   Python 3.9 or higher
*   (Optional) CUDA toolkit for GPU support

**Installation Options:**

1.  **Install via pip:**

    ```bash
    pip install pruna
    ```

2.  **Install from source:**

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/pruna-ai/pruna.git
    cd pruna
    pip install -e .
    ```

## Quick Start

Optimize your models in a few simple steps!

1.  **Load Your Model:**

    ```python
    from diffusers import StableDiffusionPipeline
    base_model = StableDiffusionPipeline.from_pretrained("stable-diffusion-v1-5/stable-diffusion-v1-5")
    ```

2.  **Optimize with `smash`:**

    ```python
    from pruna import smash, SmashConfig

    smash_config = SmashConfig()
    smash_config["cacher"] = "deepcache"
    smash_config["compiler"] = "stable_fast"
    smashed_model = smash(model=base_model, smash_config=smash_config)
    ```

3.  **Use Your Optimized Model:**

    ```python
    smashed_model("An image of a cute prune.").images[0]
    ```

4.  **Evaluate Performance:**

    ```python
    from pruna.evaluation.task import Task
    from pruna.evaluation.evaluation_agent import EvaluationAgent
    from pruna.data.pruna_datamodule import PrunaDataModule

    datamodule = PrunaDataModule.from_string("LAION256")
    datamodule.limit_datasets(10)
    task = Task("image_generation_quality", datamodule=datamodule)
    eval_agent = EvaluationAgent(task)
    eval_agent.evaluate(smashed_model)
    ```

For more advanced examples and detailed explanations, consult the [Pruna documentation][documentation].

## Algorithm Overview

Pruna provides a broad range of optimization algorithms.  Refer to the [documentation](https://docs.pruna.ai/en/stable/) for detailed descriptions.

| Technique    | Description                                                                                   | Speed | Memory | Quality |
|--------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|:-----:|:------:|:-------:|
| `batcher`    | Groups multiple inputs together to be processed simultaneously, improving computational efficiency and reducing processing time. | ✅    | ❌     | ➖      |
| `cacher`     | Stores intermediate results of computations to speed up subsequent operations.               | ✅    | ➖     | ➖      |
| `compiler`   | Optimises the model with instructions for specific hardware.                                 | ✅    | ➖     | ➖      |
| `distiller`  | Trains a smaller, simpler model to mimic a larger, more complex model.                       | ✅    | ✅     | ❌      |
| `quantizer`  | Reduces the precision of weights and activations, lowering memory requirements.              | ✅    | ✅     | ❌      |
| `pruner`     | Removes less important or redundant connections and neurons, resulting in a sparser, more efficient network. | ✅    | ✅     | ❌      |
| `recoverer`  | Restores the performance of a model after compression.                                       | ➖    | ➖     | ✅      |
| `factorizer` | Factorization batches several small matrix multiplications into one large fused operation. | ✅ | ➖ | ➖ |
| `enhancer`   | Enhances the model output by applying post-processing algorithms such as denoising or upscaling. | ❌ | ➖ | ✅ |
| `distributer`   | Distributes the inference, the model or certain calculations across multiple devices. | ✅ | ❌ | ➖ |
| `kernel`   | Kernels are specialized GPU routines that speed up parts of the computation.  | ✅ | ➖ | ➖ |

✅ (improves), ➖ (approx. the same), ❌ (worsens)
