## Introduction

Pruna is a powerful model optimization framework designed for developers. It allows you to create faster, more efficient AI models with minimal effort. Pruna provides a comprehensive set of compression algorithms:

*   **Caching:** Speeds up repeated computations. ([Learn more](https://docs.pruna.ai/en/stable/compression.html#cachers))
*   **Quantization:** Reduces model size by decreasing precision. ([Learn more](https://docs.pruna.ai/en/stable/compression.html#quantizers))
*   **Pruning:** Removes unnecessary model weights. ([Learn more](https://docs.pruna.ai/en/stable/compression.html#pruners))
*   **Distillation:** Trains smaller models to mimic larger ones. ([Learn more](https://docs.pruna.ai/en/stable/compression.html#distillers))
*   **Compilation:** Optimizes model for specific hardware. ([Learn more](https://docs.pruna.ai/en/stable/compression.html#compilers))

Pruna supports various model types, including LLMs, Diffusion and Flow Matching Models, Vision Transformers, Speech Recognition Models and more.

## Installation

Pruna is available on Linux, MacOS, and Windows.  Please note that some algorithms have platform-specific limitations.

**Prerequisites:**

*   Python 3.9 or higher
*   (Optional) [CUDA toolkit](https://docs.nvidia.com/cuda/cuda-installation-guide-linux/) for GPU support

**Installation Options:**

1.  **Install from PyPI:**
    ```bash
    pip install pruna
    ```

2.  **Install from Source:**

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/pruna-ai/pruna.git
    cd pruna
    pip install -e .
    ```

## Quick Start

Optimizing your model with Pruna is straightforward:

1.  **Load a Pre-trained Model:**

    ```python
    from diffusers import StableDiffusionPipeline
    base_model = StableDiffusionPipeline.from_pretrained("stable-diffusion-v1-5/stable-diffusion-v1-5")
    ```

2.  **Use the `smash` Function:**

    ```python
    from pruna import smash, SmashConfig

    smash_config = SmashConfig()
    smash_config["cacher"] = "deepcache"
    smash_config["compiler"] = "stable_fast"
    smashed_model = smash(model=base_model, smash_config=smash_config)
    ```

3.  **Use the Optimized Model:**

    ```python
    smashed_model("An image of a cute prune.").images[0]
    ```

4. **Evaluate your model's performance.**

    ```python
    from pruna.evaluation.task import Task
    from pruna.evaluation.evaluation_agent import EvaluationAgent
    from pruna.data.pruna_datamodule import PrunaDataModule

    datamodule = PrunaDataModule.from_string("LAION256")
    datamodule.limit_datasets(10)
    task = Task("image_generation_quality", datamodule=datamodule)
    eval_agent = EvaluationAgent(task)
    eval_agent.evaluate(smashed_model)
    ```

For more details, examples, and all supported algorithms, consult the [documentation][documentation].
