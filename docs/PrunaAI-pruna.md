## What is Pruna?

Pruna is an open-source model optimization framework designed to help developers drastically improve the performance, efficiency, and sustainability of their AI models. By utilizing compression techniques, Pruna allows you to run your models faster, at a lower cost, with a smaller footprint, and reduced environmental impact.  [Explore the Pruna project on GitHub](https://github.com/PrunaAI/pruna).

## Key Features

*   **Model Acceleration:**  Significantly reduce inference times through advanced optimization algorithms.
*   **Model Size Reduction:**  Compress models while maintaining or improving quality.
*   **Cost Optimization:**  Lower computational costs and resource requirements.
*   **Green AI:**  Decrease energy consumption and minimize environmental impact.
*   **User-Friendly:**  Optimize your models with just a few lines of code.
*   **Broad Compatibility:** Supports LLMs, Diffusion, Flow Matching, Vision Transformers, Speech Recognition Models, and more.

## Installation

Pruna is available for Linux, MacOS, and Windows. Ensure you have Python 3.9+ and optionally, the CUDA toolkit for GPU support.

### Option 1: Install using pip

```bash
pip install pruna
```

### Option 2: Install from Source

```bash
git clone https://github.com/pruna-ai/pruna.git
cd pruna
pip install -e .
```

## Quick Start

Optimize your models in a flash! Here's a simple example:

```python
from diffusers import StableDiffusionPipeline
from pruna import smash, SmashConfig

base_model = StableDiffusionPipeline.from_pretrained("stable-diffusion-v1-5/stable-diffusion-v1-5")
smash_config = SmashConfig()
smash_config["cacher"] = "deepcache"
smash_config["compiler"] = "stable_fast"
smashed_model = smash(model=base_model, smash_config=smash_config)

smashed_model("An image of a cute prune.").images[0]
```

For detailed usage, check out the [Pruna documentation][documentation].

## Pruna Pro

For advanced optimization and features, explore [Pruna Pro](https://docs.pruna.ai/en/stable/docs_pruna_pro/user_manual/pruna_pro.html), the enterprise solution offering proprietary algorithms and premium support.  See real-world performance improvements for Stable Diffusion XL, FLUX, and HunyuanVideo models.

## Algorithm Overview

Pruna offers a range of optimization techniques:

| Technique    | Description                                                                                   | Speed | Memory | Quality |
|--------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|:-----:|:------:|:-------:|
| `batcher`    | Groups multiple inputs together to be processed simultaneously, improving computational efficiency and reducing processing time. | ✅    | ❌     | ➖      |
| `cacher`     | Stores intermediate results of computations to speed up subsequent operations.               | ✅    | ➖     | ➖      |
| `compiler`   | Optimises the model with instructions for specific hardware.                                 | ✅    | ➖     | ➖      |
| `distiller`  | Trains a smaller, simpler model to mimic a larger, more complex model.                       | ✅    | ✅     | ❌      |
| `quantizer`  | Reduces the precision of weights and activations, lowering memory requirements.              | ✅    | ✅     | ❌      |
| `pruner`     | Removes less important or redundant connections and neurons, resulting in a sparser, more efficient network. | ✅    | ✅     | ❌      |
| `recoverer`  | Restores the performance of a model after compression.                                       | ➖    | ➖     | ✅      |
| `factorizer` | Factorization batches several small matrix multiplications into one large fused operation. | ✅ | ➖ | ➖ |
| `enhancer`   | Enhances the model output by applying post-processing algorithms such as denoising or upscaling. | ❌ | ➖ | ✅ |
| `distributer`   | Distributes the inference, the model or certain calculations across multiple devices. | ✅ | ❌ | ➖ |
| `kernel`   | Kernels are specialized GPU routines that speed up parts of the computation.  | ✅ | ➖ | ➖ |

✅ (improves), ➖ (approx. the same), ❌ (worsens)
