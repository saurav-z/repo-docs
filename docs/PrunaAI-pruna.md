## Introduction

Pruna is a powerful model optimization framework designed to make AI models more efficient. Built for developers, Pruna simplifies the process of accelerating and reducing the cost of AI models. It offers a comprehensive suite of compression techniques, enabling you to deploy models that are faster, smaller, more cost-effective, and environmentally friendly.

## Key Features

*   **Accelerate Inference**:  Optimize models for faster inference times.
*   **Reduce Model Size**: Decrease model size while maintaining quality.
*   **Lower Costs**: Reduce computational expenses and resource demands.
*   **Improve Sustainability**: Minimize energy consumption and environmental impact.
*   **Comprehensive Techniques**: Utilize caching, quantization, pruning, distillation, and compilation.
*   **Broad Compatibility**: Supports LLMs, Diffusion and Flow Matching Models, Vision Transformers, Speech Recognition Models, and more.
*   **User-Friendly**: Optimize models with just a few lines of code.

## Installation

Pruna is available for Linux, macOS, and Windows.  Ensure you have Python 3.9+ and, optionally, the CUDA toolkit for GPU support.

### Option 1: Install with pip

```bash
pip install pruna
```

### Option 2: Install from Source

```bash
git clone https://github.com/pruna-ai/pruna.git
cd pruna
pip install -e .
```

## Quick Start

Get started with Pruna in minutes!

1.  **Load your model:**

    ```python
    from diffusers import StableDiffusionPipeline
    base_model = StableDiffusionPipeline.from_pretrained("stable-diffusion-v1-5/stable-diffusion-v1-5")
    ```

2.  **Optimize with `smash()`:**

    ```python
    from pruna import smash, SmashConfig

    smash_config = SmashConfig()
    smash_config["cacher"] = "deepcache"
    smash_config["compiler"] = "stable_fast"
    smashed_model = smash(model=base_model, smash_config=smash_config)
    ```

3.  **Use your optimized model:**

    ```python
    smashed_model("An image of a cute prune.").images[0]
    ```

4.  **Evaluate Performance:**

    ```python
    from pruna.evaluation.task import Task
    from pruna.evaluation.evaluation_agent import EvaluationAgent
    from pruna.data.pruna_datamodule import PrunaDataModule

    datamodule = PrunaDataModule.from_string("LAION256")
    datamodule.limit_datasets(10)
    task = Task("image_generation_quality", datamodule=datamodule)
    eval_agent = EvaluationAgent(task)
    eval_agent.evaluate(smashed_model)
    ```

| `quantizer`  | Reduces the precision of weights and activations, lowering memory requirements.              | ‚úÖ    | ‚úÖ     | ‚ùå      |
| `pruner`     | Removes less important or redundant connections and neurons, resulting in a sparser, more efficient network. | ‚úÖ    | ‚úÖ     | ‚ùå      |
| `recoverer`  | Restores the performance of a model after compression.                                       | ‚ûñ    | ‚ûñ     | ‚úÖ      |
| `factorizer` | Factorization batches several small matrix multiplications into one large fused operation. | ‚úÖ | ‚ûñ | ‚ûñ |
| `enhancer`   | Enhances the model output by applying post-processing algorithms such as denoising or upscaling. | ‚ùå | ‚ûñ | ‚úÖ |
| `distributer`   | Distributes the inference, the model or certain calculations across multiple devices. | ‚úÖ | ‚ùå | ‚ûñ |
