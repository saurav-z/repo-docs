# PyTorch: The Flexible and Powerful Deep Learning Framework

**PyTorch empowers researchers and developers to build cutting-edge machine learning models with speed and efficiency.** [Visit the PyTorch GitHub Repository](https://github.com/pytorch/pytorch)

## Key Features of PyTorch

*   **Tensor Computation with GPU Acceleration:** Provides tensor operations, similar to NumPy, but with robust GPU support for fast computation.
*   **Dynamic Neural Networks with Autograd:** Offers a tape-based autograd system enabling flexible and dynamic neural network creation.
*   **Python-First Design:** Deeply integrated with Python, making it easy to leverage existing libraries like NumPy, SciPy, and Cython.
*   **Intuitive Imperative Style:** Uses an imperative programming style for easier debugging and understanding.
*   **Fast and Lean:** Incorporates optimized libraries (Intel MKL, cuDNN, NCCL) for high performance and efficient memory usage.
*   **Extensible Architecture:** Simple to extend by creating custom neural network modules or interfacing with Python's tensor API, as well as C/C++ via a convenient extension API.

## Quick Start Guide

### Installation
