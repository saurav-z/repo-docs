## üöÄ Getting Started

Jumpstart your agent development with Youtu-Agent. Follow these simple steps:

### 1. Setup
  #### Source Code Deployment
    1. Ensure Python 3.12+ and `uv` (recommended) are installed.
    2. Clone the repository and set up dependencies:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/TencentCloudADP/youtu-agent.git
    cd youtu-agent
    uv sync  # or, `make sync`
    source ./.venv/bin/activate
    cp .env.example .env  # Configure your API keys here.
    ```
    3. Populate the `.env` file with your LLM API keys (e.g., DeepSeek, OpenAI).
  #### Docker Deployment
  Refer to [`docker/README.md`](./docker/README.md) for a streamlined Docker-based deployment.

### 2. Quick Start
  1. Run an interactive CLI chatbot with a search tool:
    ```bash
    # Configure API keys for web search in `.env` (SERPER_API_KEY, JINA_API_KEY)
    python scripts/cli_chat.py --stream --config default
    ```
  2. Launch a simple agent (without search) if you skip the tool configuration:
    ```bash
    python scripts/cli_chat.py --stream --config base
    ```

### 3. Explore Examples
  * Enable search tools in `.env` (SERPER_API_KEY, JINA_API_KEY) to run examples.
  * Run SVG image generation:
    ```bash
    python examples/svg_generator/main.py
    ```
  *  View the web UI and visualization by running:
    ```bash
    uv pip install utu_agent_ui-0.1.5-py3-none-any.whl
    python examples/svg_generator/main_web.py
    ```
    *Access the project by the local link shown by terminal*

### 4. Run Evaluations
  * Evaluate on WebWalkerQA:
    ```bash
    python scripts/data/process_web_walker_qa.py
    python scripts/run_eval.py --config_name ww --exp_id <your_exp_id> --dataset WebWalkerQA_15 --concurrency 5
    ```
  * Review the results using the evaluation platform for analysis ([Evaluation Analysis](./frontend/exp_analysis/README.md)).

## ‚ú® Features

### Core Features
- **Built on openai-agents**: Leveraging the foundation of [openai-agents](https://github.com/openai/openai-agents-python) SDK, our framework inherits streaming, tracing, and agent-loop capabilities, ensuring compatibility with both `responses` and `chat.completions` APIs for seamless adaptation to diverse models like [gpt-oss](https://github.com/openai/gpt-oss).
- **Fully asynchronous**: Enables high-performance and efficient execution, especially beneficial for evaluating benchmarks.
- **Tracing & analysis system**: Beyond OTEL, our `DBTracingProcessor` system provides in-depth analysis of tool calls and agent trajectories. (will be released soon)

### Automation
- **YAML based configuration**: Structured and easily manageable agent configurations.
- **Automatic agent generation**: Based on user requirements, agent configurations can be automatically generated.
- **Tool generation & optimization**: Tool evaluation and automated optimization, and customized tool generation will be supported in the future.

### Use Cases
- **Deep / Wide research**: Covers common search-oriented tasks.
- **Webpage generation**: Examples include generating web pages based on specific inputs.
- **Trajectory collection**: Supports data collection for training and research purposes.
