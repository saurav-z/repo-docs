## Key Features

*   **Extensive Game Database:**  Browse a growing collection of open-source game clones and remakes, referencing their original game counterparts.
*   **YAML-Based Data:** Game and original game information is stored in easily accessible YAML files (`games/` and `originals/`), making it easy to contribute.
*   **Contribution Encouraged:**  Submit new games, update existing entries, and improve the information through pull requests or by opening issues.
*   **Validation:**  All game entries are validated against defined schemas (`schema/games.yaml` and `schema/originals.yaml`) ensuring data integrity.
*   **Easy Setup:**  Simple instructions for local setup, including Docker support for easy deployment.
