## Key Features:

*   **High-Performance Training:** Efficiently trains LLMs using RL, integrating Megatron with SGLang for optimized performance.
*   **Flexible Data Generation:** Enables custom data generation workflows through adaptable interfaces and server-based engines.
*   **Agentic RL Support:** Designed with agentic training in mind, supporting asynchronous and decoupled RL frameworks.

## Core Capabilities:

*   **Efficient Training:** Streamlines the RL training process, optimizing the utilization of computational resources.
*   **Custom Data Workflows:** Facilitates the creation of tailor-made datasets to address specific training requirements.

## Key Components:

*   **Training (Megatron):** Manages the central training operations, interacting with data sources and parameter synchronization.
*   **Rollout (SGLang + Router):** Generates data and feedback, feeding new information into the training loop.
*   **Data Buffer:** Acts as a critical intermediary, handling prompt initialization, custom data integration, and rollout control.
