# Apache Airflow: Orchestrate, Schedule, and Monitor Workflows

**Apache Airflow is a powerful, open-source platform for programmatically authoring, scheduling, and monitoring workflows, making complex data pipelines manageable and reliable.**  Learn more about the project at the [original Apache Airflow repository](https://github.com/apache/airflow).

## Key Features

*   **Dynamic**: Define workflows in code for dynamic DAG generation and parameterization.
*   **Extensible**: Leverage a wide range of built-in operators and easily extend Airflow to meet your specific needs.
*   **Flexible**: Customize pipelines extensively using the [**Jinja**](https://jinja.palletsprojects.com) templating engine.

## Installation

Get started quickly by following our [comprehensive instructions](INSTALLING.md) on how to set up your local development environment.

## Core Concepts

*   **DAGs (Directed Acyclic Graphs)**: Visual representation of the entire workflow.
*   **Operators**: Pre-built or custom-created components representing tasks within a DAG.
*   **Schedulers**: Automated execution engine based on the defined schedule or trigger conditions.
*   **Web UI**: User-friendly interface to monitor and manage workflows.

## Benefits of Using Apache Airflow

*   **Enhanced Collaboration:** Workflow as code promotes version control, testing, and collaboration.
*   **Improved Reliability:**  Schedule and monitor workflows, simplifying data pipeline management and debugging.
*   **Scalability:**  Orchestrate workflows of any size, from simple to complex, for maximum efficiency.

## Quick Start Guide

1.  **Installation:** Follow our detailed [Installation Guide](INSTALLING.md) for local setup.
2.  **Defining a DAG:** Create a Python script to define your workflow using Airflow's operators.
3.  **Running a Workflow:** Schedule and trigger your DAG via the Airflow Web UI or command-line interface.
4.  **Monitoring and Debugging:** Use the Airflow UI to visualize your workflows, track progress, and troubleshoot issues.

## Installation Options

*   **PyPI**: Install the latest official release via pip:

    ```bash
    pip install apache-airflow
    ```

    For repeatable installations, use the constraint files:
    ```bash
    pip install 'apache-airflow==3.0.5' \
     --constraint "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/apache/airflow/constraints-3.0.5/constraints-3.10.txt"
    ```

*   **Convenience Packages**: Consider Docker Images and GitHub Tags.

## Key Considerations
Airflow is commonly used to process data, but has the opinion that tasks should ideally be idempotent (i.e., results of the task will be the same, and will not create duplicated data in a destination system), and should not pass large quantities of data from one task to the next (though tasks can pass metadata using Airflow's [XCom feature](https://airflow.apache.org/docs/apache-airflow/stable/concepts/xcoms.html)). For high-volume, data-intensive tasks, a best practice is to delegate to external services specializing in that type of work. Airflow is not a streaming solution, but it is often used to process real-time data, pulling data off streams in batches.

## Requirements

Airflow is compatible with the following versions:

*   **Python:** 3.9, 3.10, 3.11, 3.12 (See [Requirements](README.md#requirements) section for full details).

## User Interface

The Airflow UI provides a comprehensive view of your data pipelines, including:

*   **DAGs:** Overview of all workflows.
*   **Assets:** Dependency overview.
*   **Grid:** Time-based view of DAGs.
*   **Graph:** Dependency and status of DAG runs.
*   **Home:** Summary statistics of Airflow environment.
*   **Backfill:** Data range backfilling.
*   **Code:** Quick DAG source code view.
