# Apache Airflow: Orchestrate Your Workflows with Code ðŸš€

**Apache Airflow** is a powerful, open-source platform that allows you to programmatically author, schedule, and monitor your workflows. [Explore the official Apache Airflow repository](https://github.com/apache/airflow).

## Key Features

*   **Dynamic Workflow Definition:** Define workflows as code (Python), enabling dynamic DAG generation and parameterization.
*   **Extensible Architecture:**  Airflow's framework boasts a wide range of built-in operators and flexible extensibility to fit your needs.
*   **Flexible Templating:** Leverage the Jinja templating engine for rich customizations, empowering you with unparalleled control.
*   **Scalable Scheduling & Execution:**  The Airflow scheduler efficiently executes tasks across a distributed worker pool.
*   **Comprehensive Monitoring & UI:**  Visualize pipelines, monitor progress, and troubleshoot with a user-friendly interface.

## Project Focus

Airflow excels at managing workflows that are largely static and evolve gradually. Define DAGs (Directed Acyclic Graphs) in code, ensuring maintainability, version control, testability, and collaboration.

## Principles

*   **Dynamic:** Pipelines are defined in code, enabling dynamic dag generation and parameterization.
*   **Extensible:** The Airflow framework includes a wide range of built-in operators and can be extended to fit your needs.
*   **Flexible:** Airflow leverages the [**Jinja**](https://jinja.palletsprojects.com) templating engine, allowing rich customizations.

## Requirements

Apache Airflow is tested with the following versions:

|            | Main version (dev)           | Stable version (3.0.6) |
|------------|------------------------------|------------------------|
| Python     | 3.10, 3.11, 3.12, 3.13       | 3.9, 3.10, 3.11, 3.12  |
| Platform   | AMD64/ARM64(\*)              | AMD64/ARM64(\*)        |
| Kubernetes | 1.30, 1.31, 1.32, 1.33, 1.34 | 1.30, 1.31, 1.32, 1.33 |
| PostgreSQL | 13, 14, 15, 16, 17           | 13, 14, 15, 16, 17     |
| MySQL      | 8.0, 8.4, Innovation         | 8.0, 8.4, Innovation   |
| SQLite     | 3.15.0+                      | 3.15.0+                |

\* Experimental

**Note**: MariaDB is not tested/recommended.

**Note**: SQLite is used in Airflow tests. Do not use it in production. We recommend
using the latest stable version of SQLite for local development.

**Note**: Airflow currently can be run on POSIX-compliant Operating Systems. For development, it is regularly
tested on fairly modern Linux Distros and recent versions of macOS.
On Windows you can run it via WSL2 (Windows Subsystem for Linux 2) or via Linux Containers.
The work to add Windows support is tracked via [#10388](https://github.com/apache/airflow/issues/10388), but
it is not a high priority. You should only use Linux-based distros as "Production" execution environment
as this is the only environment that is supported. The only distro that is used in our CI tests and that
is used in the [Community managed DockerHub image](https://hub.docker.com/p/apache/airflow) is
`Debian Bookworm`.

<!-- End of auto-generated table -->

Limited support versions will be supported with security and critical bug fix only.
EOL versions will not get any fixes nor support.
We always recommend that all users run the latest available minor release for whatever major version is in use.
We **highly** recommend upgrading to the latest Airflow major release at the earliest convenient time and before the EOL date.

## Support for Python and Kubernetes Versions

Airflow adheres to a policy based on Python and Kubernetes release schedules, ensuring compatibility and timely updates.

## Base OS Support for Reference Airflow Images

The Airflow Community provides conveniently packaged container images that are published whenever
we publish an Apache Airflow release. Those images contain:

* Base OS with necessary packages to install Airflow (stable Debian OS)
* Base Python installation in versions supported at the time of release for the MINOR version of
  Airflow released (so there could be different versions for 2.3 and 2.2 line for example)
* Libraries required to connect to supported Databases (again the set of databases supported depends
  on the MINOR version of Airflow)
* Predefined set of popular providers (for details see the [Dockerfile](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/apache/airflow/main/Dockerfile)).
* Possibility of building your own, custom image where the user can choose their own set of providers
  and libraries (see [Building the image](https://airflow.apache.org/docs/docker-stack/build.html))
* In the future Airflow might also support a "slim" version without providers nor database clients installed

The version of the base OS image is the stable version of Debian. Airflow supports using all currently active
stable versions - as soon as all Airflow dependencies support building, and we set up the CI pipeline for
building and testing the OS version. Approximately 6 months before the end-of-regular support of a
previous stable version of the OS, Airflow switches the images released to use the latest supported
version of the OS.

For example switch from ``Debian Bullseye`` to ``Debian Bookworm`` has been implemented
before 2.8.0 release in October 2023 and ``Debian Bookworm`` will be the only option supported as of
Airflow 2.10.0.

Users will continue to be able to build their images using stable Debian releases until the end of regular
support and building and verifying of the images happens in our CI but no unit tests were executed using
this image in the `main` branch.

## Approach to Dependencies of Airflow

Airflow uses a constraints-based approach to dependency management, balancing stability and flexibility for users.

### Approach for Dependencies for Airflow Core

Airflow core dependencies are managed in `pyproject.toml`, and several dependencies are upper-bound for stability.

### Approach for Dependencies in Airflow Providers and Extras

Provider dependencies are maintained in each provider's `provider.yaml` file.
