# Apache Airflow: Orchestrate, Schedule, and Monitor Workflows with Code

**Apache Airflow** is an open-source platform that allows you to programmatically author, schedule, and monitor complex data pipelines. [Explore the Apache Airflow Repository](https://github.com/apache/airflow).

## Key Features

*   **Dynamic:** Define workflows as code for flexibility and maintainability.
*   **Extensible:** Leverage a rich set of built-in operators and customize your workflows.
*   **Flexible:** Utilize the **Jinja** templating engine for advanced workflow customization.
*   **Scalable:** Orchestrate tasks across a distributed environment.
*   **User-Friendly:** Benefit from a rich user interface for monitoring and troubleshooting.

## Core Principles

*   Workflows are defined in code (Python), and can be easily versioned, tested, and collaborated on.
*   Tasks should ideally be idempotent.

## Requirements

*   **Python:** 3.9, 3.10, 3.11, 3.12 (stable) / 3.10, 3.11, 3.12, 3.13 (main/dev)
*   **Kubernetes:** 1.30, 1.31, 1.32, 1.33
*   **Database Support:** PostgreSQL, MySQL, SQLite (for testing), and more.
*   **Operating System:** POSIX-compliant OS, tested on modern Linux distros (Debian Bookworm), and macOS. Windows supported via WSL2 or Linux containers.

## Getting Started

Find comprehensive guides for [installing Airflow](https://airflow.apache.org/docs/apache-airflow/stable/installation/), [getting started](https://airflow.apache.org/docs/apache-airflow/stable/start.html), and [tutorials](https://airflow.apache.org/docs/apache-airflow/stable/tutorial/) within the official documentation.

## Installing from PyPI

Install Airflow using `pip` with constraint files for reliable dependency management:

```bash
pip install 'apache-airflow==3.0.5' \
 --constraint "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/apache/airflow/constraints-3.0.5/constraints-3.10.txt"
```

Install with extras (e.g., Postgres, Google):

```bash
pip install 'apache-airflow[postgres,google]==3.0.5' \
 --constraint "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/apache/airflow/constraints-3.0.5/constraints-3.10.txt"
```

## Official Source Code

Airflow is an [Apache Software Foundation](https://www.apache.org) (ASF) project. Download official releases from the [ASF Distribution Directory](https://downloads.apache.org/airflow), which are cryptographically signed and voted on by the PMC.

## User Interface

*   **DAGs:** Overview of all DAGs.
*   **Assets:** Asset Dependencies.
*   **Grid:** Grid representation of a DAG.
*   **Graph:** Visualization of a DAG's dependencies and their current status for a specific run.
*   **Home:** Summary statistics of your Airflow environment.
*   **Backfill:** Backfilling a DAG for a specific date range.
*   **Code:** View source code of a DAG.

## Version Lifecycle

Airflow follows semantic versioning (SemVer). Review the [Version Life Cycle](#version-life-cycle) to understand supported and EOL versions. We recommend that all users run the latest minor version of the current major version.
