# Apache Airflow: Orchestrate and Schedule Your Workflows with Code

**Apache Airflow** is a powerful platform for programmatically authoring, scheduling, and monitoring complex workflows, enabling data engineers and data scientists to build and manage robust data pipelines.  ([Original Repo](https://github.com/apache/airflow))

## Key Features:

*   **Dynamic Workflows as Code:** Define pipelines using Python code for maintainability, version control, testing, and collaboration.
*   **Extensible Architecture:** Leverage a wide range of built-in operators and easily extend Airflow to integrate with various systems and tools.
*   **Flexible Scheduling:** Schedule and orchestrate tasks with dependencies, retry mechanisms, and advanced scheduling options.
*   **Rich User Interface:** Visualize pipeline execution, monitor progress, and troubleshoot issues effectively through a user-friendly web interface.

## Core Principles:

*   **Dynamic:** Pipelines are defined in code, enabling dynamic DAG generation and parameterization.
*   **Extensible:** The Airflow framework includes a wide range of built-in operators and can be extended to fit your needs.
*   **Flexible:** Airflow leverages the [**Jinja**](https://jinja.palletsprojects.com) templating engine, allowing rich customizations.

## Benefits:

*   **Improved Workflow Management:** Simplify complex data pipelines with a centralized and easy-to-use platform.
*   **Enhanced Collaboration:** Enable teams to work together effectively on data workflows.
*   **Increased Reliability:** Ensure data pipeline reliability with built-in monitoring and error handling.
*   **Scalability:** Scale data pipelines to handle large volumes of data and complex business requirements.

## Requirements

Apache Airflow is tested with:

|            | Main version (dev)     | Stable version (3.0.2) |
|------------|------------------------|------------------------|
| Python     | 3.10, 3.11, 3.12       | 3.9, 3.10, 3.11, 3.12  |
| Platform   | AMD64/ARM64(\*)        | AMD64/ARM64(\*)        |
| Kubernetes | 1.30, 1.31, 1.32, 1.33 | 1.30, 1.31, 1.32, 1.33 |
| PostgreSQL | 13, 14, 15, 16, 17     | 13, 14, 15, 16, 17     |
| MySQL      | 8.0, 8.4, Innovation   | 8.0, 8.4, Innovation   |
| SQLite     | 3.15.0+                | 3.15.0+                |

\* Experimental

**Note**: MariaDB is not tested/recommended.

**Note**: SQLite is used in Airflow tests. Do not use it in production. We recommend
using the latest stable version of SQLite for local development.

**Note**: Airflow currently can be run on POSIX-compliant Operating Systems. For development, it is regularly
tested on fairly modern Linux Distros and recent versions of macOS.
On Windows you can run it via WSL2 (Windows Subsystem for Linux 2) or via Linux Containers.
The work to add Windows support is tracked via [#10388](https://github.com/apache/airflow/issues/10388), but
it is not a high priority. You should only use Linux-based distros as "Production" execution environment
as this is the only environment that is supported. The only distro that is used in our CI tests and that
is used in the [Community managed DockerHub image](https://hub.docker.com/p/apache/airflow) is
`Debian Bookworm`.

## Getting Started

Explore the official Airflow documentation for comprehensive guidance on [installation](https://airflow.apache.org/docs/apache-airflow/stable/installation/), [quickstart](https://airflow.apache.org/docs/apache-airflow/stable/start.html), and detailed [tutorials](https://airflow.apache.org/docs/apache-airflow/stable/tutorial/).

    ```

2.  Installing with extras:

    ```bash
    pip install 'apache-airflow[postgres,google]==3.0.2' \
     --constraint "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/apache/airflow/constraints-3.0.2/constraints-3.10.txt"
