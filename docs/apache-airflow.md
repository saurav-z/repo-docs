# Apache Airflow: Orchestrate, Schedule, and Monitor Workflows at Scale

**Apache Airflow** is a leading open-source platform for programmatically authoring, scheduling, and monitoring complex data pipelines.  This powerful tool allows data engineers and data scientists to define workflows as code, making them more manageable, versionable, and collaborative.

## Key Features

*   **Dynamic Workflows:** Define pipelines using Python code for flexibility and parameterization.
*   **Extensible Architecture:** Leverage a wide range of built-in operators and easily create custom ones.
*   **User-Friendly Interface:** Monitor progress, visualize pipelines, and troubleshoot issues with an intuitive web UI.
*   **Scalable Scheduling:**  The Airflow scheduler executes tasks on a distributed array of workers, ensuring efficient execution.
*   **Idempotent Tasks:** Designed with a focus on idempotent tasks, promoting data integrity.

## Core Principles

*   **Dynamic:** Pipelines are defined in code, enabling dynamic DAG generation and parameterization.
*   **Extensible:** The Airflow framework includes a wide range of built-in operators and can be extended to fit your needs.
*   **Flexible:** Airflow leverages the [**Jinja**](https://jinja.palletsprojects.com) templating engine, allowing rich customizations.
