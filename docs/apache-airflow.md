[Apache Airflow](https://github.com/apache/airflow) (Airflow) empowers you to define, schedule, and monitor workflows as code, bringing maintainability, version control, and collaboration to your data pipelines.

**Key Features:**

*   **Dynamic:** Define pipelines with code, enabling dynamic DAG generation and parameterization.
*   **Extensible:** Utilize a wide range of built-in operators and customize Airflow to fit your needs.
*   **Flexible:** Leverage the **Jinja** templating engine for rich customization options.

**Benefits:**

*   **Versionable Workflows:** Manage and track changes to your pipelines using version control.
*   **Automated Scheduling:** Schedule tasks and workflows with ease.
*   **Real-time Monitoring:** Monitor pipeline execution, progress, and troubleshoot issues through a user-friendly interface.
*   **Scalability:** Designed to handle complex workflows at scale.
*   **Idempotent Tasks:** Ensure data integrity with idempotent tasks.

## Requirements

*   **Python:**  3.9, 3.10, 3.11, 3.12
*   **Platform:** AMD64/ARM64
*   **Kubernetes:** 1.30, 1.31, 1.32, 1.33
*   **Databases:** PostgreSQL, MySQL, SQLite
    *   _Note:  SQLite is for testing only; do not use it in production._

## Installation

1.  Install via PyPI (with constraints for stable dependencies):

    ```bash
    pip install 'apache-airflow==3.0.2' \
     --constraint "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/apache/airflow/constraints-3.0.2/constraints-3.10.txt"
    ```
    *   For more installation options, including extras, see the detailed instructions at the original [Airflow installation documentation](https://airflow.apache.org/docs/apache-airflow/stable/installation/).

2.  Install with Extras, e.g. postgres, google:

    ```bash
    pip install 'apache-airflow[postgres,google]==3.0.2' \
     --constraint "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/apache/airflow/constraints-3.0.2/constraints-3.10.txt"
    ```

3.  Review the [INSTALLING.md](INSTALLING.md) file for comprehensive setup and installation instructions.

## Key Concepts

*   **DAGs (Directed Acyclic Graphs):** Workflows defined as code, enabling dynamic DAG generation and parameterization.
*   **Operators:**  Pre-built building blocks for tasks, such as data transfer, execution and more.
*   **Schedulers:** Automated tools for executing DAGs and tasks on time.
*   **Workers:** The engines which execute your task, driven by schedulers.
