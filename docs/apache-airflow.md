# Apache Airflow: Orchestrate Your Workflows

**Automate, schedule, and monitor your data pipelines with Apache Airflow, the leading open-source workflow management platform.**  [Get started with Airflow](https://github.com/apache/airflow)

Apache Airflow (or simply Airflow) is a powerful platform for programmatically authoring, scheduling, and monitoring workflows. Define your workflows as code for maintainability, version control, and collaboration.

## Key Features

*   **Dynamic Workflows:** Define pipelines in code for dynamic DAG generation and parameterization.
*   **Extensible Architecture:** Utilize a wide range of built-in operators and easily extend Airflow to fit your needs.
*   **Flexible Customization:** Leverage the **Jinja** templating engine for rich customization options.
*   **User-Friendly Interface:** Visualize pipeline execution, monitor progress, and troubleshoot issues through a comprehensive UI.
*   **Scalable:** Efficiently executes tasks on an array of workers.

## Getting Started

Visit the official Airflow website documentation (latest **stable** release) for help with
[installing Airflow](https://airflow.apache.org/docs/apache-airflow/stable/installation/),
[getting started](https://airflow.apache.org/docs/apache-airflow/stable/start.html), or walking
through a more complete [tutorial](https://airflow.apache.org/docs/apache-airflow/stable/tutorial/).

> Note: If you're looking for documentation for the main branch (latest development branch): you can find it on [s.apache.org/airflow-docs](https://s.apache.org/airflow-docs/).

For more information on Airflow Improvement Proposals (AIPs), visit
the [Airflow Wiki](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/AIRFLOW/Airflow+Improvement+Proposals).

Documentation for dependent projects like provider distributions, Docker image, Helm Chart, you'll find it in [the documentation index](https://airflow.apache.org/docs/).

## Requirements

Apache Airflow is tested with:

|            | Main version (dev)     | Stable version (3.0.6) |
|------------|------------------------|------------------------|
| Python     | 3.10, 3.11, 3.12, 3.13 | 3.9, 3.10, 3.11, 3.12  |
| Platform   | AMD64/ARM64(\*)        | AMD64/ARM64(\*)        |
| Kubernetes | 1.30, 1.31, 1.32, 1.33 | 1.30, 1.31, 1.32, 1.33 |
| PostgreSQL | 13, 14, 15, 16, 17     | 13, 14, 15, 16, 17     |
| MySQL      | 8.0, 8.4, Innovation   | 8.0, 8.4, Innovation   |
| SQLite     | 3.15.0+                | 3.15.0+                |

\* Experimental

**Note**: MariaDB is not tested/recommended.

**Note**: SQLite is used in Airflow tests. Do not use it in production. We recommend
using the latest stable version of SQLite for local development.

**Note**: Airflow currently can be run on POSIX-compliant Operating Systems. For development, it is regularly
tested on fairly modern Linux Distros and recent versions of macOS.
On Windows you can run it via WSL2 (Windows Subsystem for Linux 2) or via Linux Containers.
The work to add Windows support is tracked via [#10388](https://github.com/apache/airflow/issues/10388), but
it is not a high priority. You should only use Linux-based distros as "Production" execution environment
as this is the only environment that is supported. The only distro that is used in our CI tests and that
is used in the [Community managed DockerHub image](https://hub.docker.com/p/apache/airflow) is
`Debian Bookworm`.

## Installing from PyPI

Install Apache Airflow via PyPI using constraint files for reliable installations.

```bash
pip install 'apache-airflow==3.0.6' \
 --constraint "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/apache/airflow/constraints-3.0.6/constraints-3.10.txt"
```

## Installation

For comprehensive instructions on setting up your local development environment and installing Apache Airflow, please refer to the [INSTALLING.md](INSTALLING.md) file.

## Official Source Code

Apache Airflow is an [Apache Software Foundation](https://www.apache.org) (ASF) project,
and our official source code releases:

- Follow the [ASF Release Policy](https://www.apache.org/legal/release-policy.html)
- Can be downloaded from [the ASF Distribution Directory](https://downloads.apache.org/airflow)
