# Apache Airflow: Orchestrate Your Workflows with Code

**Automate, schedule, and monitor your workflows effortlessly with Apache Airflow**, a powerful, open-source platform. [Explore the original repository](https://github.com/apache/airflow) for more information.

## Key Features

*   **Dynamic Workflows:** Define pipelines as code for maintainability, version control, and collaboration.
*   **Extensible:** Leverage a wide range of built-in operators and customize Airflow to fit your needs.
*   **Flexible:** Utilize the [Jinja](https://jinja.palletsprojects.com) templating engine for rich customization.
*   **Scalable:**  Execute tasks on an array of workers with the Airflow scheduler.
*   **User-Friendly Interface:** Visualize pipelines, monitor progress, and troubleshoot issues through a rich UI.

## Project Focus

Airflow is designed for mostly static and slowly-changing workflows. It is commonly used for data processing.

## Principles

*   **Dynamic**: Pipelines are defined in code, enabling dynamic dag generation and parameterization.
*   **Extensible**: The Airflow framework includes a wide range of built-in operators and can be extended to fit your needs.
*   **Flexible**: Airflow leverages the [**Jinja**](https://jinja.palletsprojects.com) templating engine, allowing rich customizations.

## Requirements

Apache Airflow is tested with:

|            | Main version (dev)     | Stable version (3.0.6) |
|------------|------------------------|------------------------|
| Python     | 3.10, 3.11, 3.12, 3.13 | 3.9, 3.10, 3.11, 3.12  |
| Platform   | AMD64/ARM64(\*)        | AMD64/ARM64(\*)        |
| Kubernetes | 1.30, 1.31, 1.32, 1.33 | 1.30, 1.31, 1.32, 1.33 |
| PostgreSQL | 13, 14, 15, 16, 17     | 13, 14, 15, 16, 17     |
| MySQL      | 8.0, 8.4, Innovation   | 8.0, 8.4, Innovation   |
| SQLite     | 3.15.0+                | 3.15.0+                |

\* Experimental

**Note**: MariaDB is not tested/recommended.

**Note**: SQLite is used in Airflow tests. Do not use it in production. We recommend
using the latest stable version of SQLite for local development.

**Note**: Airflow currently can be run on POSIX-compliant Operating Systems. For development, it is regularly
tested on fairly modern Linux Distros and recent versions of macOS.
On Windows you can run it via WSL2 (Windows Subsystem for Linux 2) or via Linux Containers.
The work to add Windows support is tracked via [#10388](https://github.com/apache/airflow/issues/10388), but
it is not a high priority. You should only use Linux-based distros as "Production" execution environment
as this is the only environment that is supported. The only distro that is used in our CI tests and that
is used in the [Community managed DockerHub image](https://hub.docker.com/p/apache/airflow) is
`Debian Bookworm`.

<!-- End of auto-generated table -->

Limited support versions will be supported with security and critical bug fix only.
EOL versions will not get any fixes nor support.
We always recommend that all users run the latest available minor release for whatever major version is in use.
We **highly** recommend upgrading to the latest Airflow major release at the earliest convenient time and before the EOL date.

## Support for Python and Kubernetes versions

Airflow follows specific rules for Python and Kubernetes support, based on their official release schedules.

## Base OS support for reference Airflow images

The Airflow Community provides conveniently packaged container images that are published whenever
we publish an Apache Airflow release. Those images contain:

* Base OS with necessary packages to install Airflow (stable Debian OS)
* Base Python installation in versions supported at the time of release for the MINOR version of
  Airflow released (so there could be different versions for 2.3 and 2.2 line for example)
* Libraries required to connect to supported Databases (again the set of databases supported depends
  on the MINOR version of Airflow)
* Predefined set of popular providers (for details see the [Dockerfile](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/apache/airflow/main/Dockerfile)).
* Possibility of building your own, custom image where the user can choose their own set of providers
  and libraries (see [Building the image](https://airflow.apache.org/docs/docker-stack/build.html))
* In the future Airflow might also support a "slim" version without providers nor database clients installed

The version of the base OS image is the stable version of Debian. Airflow supports using all currently active
stable versions - as soon as all Airflow dependencies support building, and we set up the CI pipeline for
building and testing the OS version. Approximately 6 months before the end-of-regular support of a
previous stable version of the OS, Airflow switches the images released to use the latest supported
version of the OS.

For example switch from ``Debian Bullseye`` to ``Debian Bookworm`` has been implemented
before 2.8.0 release in October 2023 and ``Debian Bookworm`` will be the only option supported as of
Airflow 2.10.0.

Users will continue to be able to build their images using stable Debian releases until the end of regular
support and building and verifying of the images happens in our CI but no unit tests were executed using
this image in the `main` branch.

## Approach to dependencies of Airflow

Airflow has a lot of dependencies - direct and transitive, also Airflow is both - library and application,
therefore our policies to dependencies has to include both - stability of installation of application,
but also ability to install newer version of dependencies for those users who develop DAGs. We developed
the approach where `constraints` are used to make sure airflow can be installed in a repeatable way, while
we do not limit our users to upgrade most of the dependencies. As a result we decided not to upper-bound
version of Airflow dependencies by default, unless we have good reasons to believe upper-bounding them is
needed because of importance of the dependency as well as risk it involves to upgrade specific dependency.
We also upper-bound the dependencies that we know cause problems.

The constraint mechanism of ours takes care about finding and upgrading all the non-upper bound dependencies
automatically (providing that all the tests pass). Our `main` build failures will indicate in case there
are versions of dependencies that break our tests - indicating that we should either upper-bind them or
that we should fix our code/tests to account for the upstream changes from those dependencies.

Whenever we upper-bound such a dependency, we should always comment why we are doing it - i.e. we should have
a good reason why dependency is upper-bound. And we should also mention what is the condition to remove the
binding.

### Approach for dependencies for Airflow Core

Those dependencies are maintained in ``pyproject.toml``.

There are few dependencies that we decided are important enough to upper-bound them by default, as they are
known to follow predictable versioning scheme, and we know that new versions of those are very likely to
bring breaking changes. We commit to regularly review and attempt to upgrade to the newer versions of
the dependencies as they are released, but this is manual process.

The important dependencies are:

* `SQLAlchemy`: upper-bound to specific MINOR version (SQLAlchemy is known to remove deprecations and
   introduce breaking changes especially that support for different Databases varies and changes at
   various speed)
* `Alembic`: it is important to handle our migrations in predictable and performant way. It is developed
   together with SQLAlchemy. Our experience with Alembic is that it very stable in MINOR version
* `Flask`: We are using Flask as the back-bone of our web UI and API. We know major version of Flask
   are very likely to introduce breaking changes across those so limiting it to MAJOR version makes sense
* `werkzeug`: the library is known to cause problems in new versions. It is tightly coupled with Flask
   libraries, and we should update them together
* `celery`: Celery is a crucial component of Airflow as it used for CeleryExecutor (and similar). Celery
   [follows SemVer](https://docs.celeryq.dev/en/stable/contributing.html?highlight=semver#versions), so
   we should upper-bound it to the next MAJOR version. Also, when we bump the upper version of the library,
   we should make sure Celery Provider minimum Airflow version is updated.
* `kubernetes`: Kubernetes is a crucial component of Airflow as it is used for the KubernetesExecutor
   (and similar). Kubernetes Python library [follows SemVer](https://github.com/kubernetes-client/python#compatibility),
   so we should upper-bound it to the next MAJOR version. Also, when we bump the upper version of the library,
   we should make sure Kubernetes Provider minimum Airflow version is updated.

### Approach for dependencies in Airflow Providers and extras

The main part of the Airflow is the Airflow Core, but the power of Airflow also comes from a number of
providers that extend the core functionality and are released separately, even if we keep them (for now)
in the same monorepo for convenience. You can read more about the providers in the
[Providers documentation](https://airflow.apache.org/docs/apache-airflow-providers/index.html). We also
have set of policies implemented for maintaining and releasing community-managed providers as well
as the approach for community vs. 3rd party providers in the [providers](https://github.com/apache/airflow/blob/main/PROVIDERS.rst) document.

Those `extras` and `providers` dependencies are maintained in `provider.yaml` of each provider.

By default, we should not upper-bound dependencies for providers, however each provider's maintainer
might decide to add additional limits (and justify them with comment).
