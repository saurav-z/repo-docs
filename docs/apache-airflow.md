# Apache Airflow: Orchestrate Your Workflows with Code

**Apache Airflow is an open-source platform that enables you to programmatically author, schedule, and monitor your data workflows, making them more maintainable, testable, and collaborative.**  [Explore the Apache Airflow repository](https://github.com/apache/airflow)

**Key Features:**

*   **Dynamic Workflows:** Define pipelines in code for dynamic DAG generation and parameterization.
*   **Extensible:** Utilize a wide range of built-in operators and easily extend Airflow to meet your needs.
*   **Flexible:** Leverage the power of the Jinja templating engine for rich customizations.
*   **Scalable:** Execute tasks on an array of workers managed by the Airflow scheduler.
*   **Monitoring and Troubleshooting:** Visualize pipelines, monitor progress, and troubleshoot issues through the user-friendly UI.

## Project Focus

Airflow is designed for workflows that are largely static and have incremental changes over time. Airflow focuses on idempotent tasks.

## Principles

*   **Dynamic:** Pipelines are defined in code, enabling dynamic dag generation and parameterization.
*   **Extensible:** The Airflow framework includes a wide range of built-in operators and can be extended to fit your needs.
*   **Flexible:** Airflow leverages the [**Jinja**](https://jinja.palletsprojects.com) templating engine, allowing rich customizations.

## Requirements

Apache Airflow is tested with:

|            | Main version (dev)     | Stable version (3.0.6) |
|------------|------------------------|------------------------|
| Python     | 3.10, 3.11, 3.12, 3.13 | 3.9, 3.10, 3.11, 3.12  |
| Platform   | AMD64/ARM64(\*)        | AMD64/ARM64(\*)        |
| Kubernetes | 1.30, 1.31, 1.32, 1.33 | 1.30, 1.31, 1.32, 1.33 |
| PostgreSQL | 13, 14, 15, 16, 17     | 13, 14, 15, 16, 17     |
| MySQL      | 8.0, 8.4, Innovation   | 8.0, 8.4, Innovation   |
| SQLite     | 3.15.0+                | 3.15.0+                |

\* Experimental

**Note**: MariaDB is not tested/recommended.

**Note**: SQLite is used in Airflow tests. Do not use it in production. We recommend
using the latest stable version of SQLite for local development.

**Note**: Airflow currently can be run on POSIX-compliant Operating Systems. For development, it is regularly
tested on fairly modern Linux Distros and recent versions of macOS.
On Windows you can run it via WSL2 (Windows Subsystem for Linux 2) or via Linux Containers.
The work to add Windows support is tracked via [#10388](https://github.com/apache/airflow/issues/10388), but
it is not a high priority. You should only use Linux-based distros as "Production" execution environment
as this is the only environment that is supported. The only distro that is used in our CI tests and that
is used in the [Community managed DockerHub image](https://hub.docker.com/p/apache/airflow) is
`Debian Bookworm`.

## Getting Started

Visit the official Airflow website documentation (latest **stable** release) for help with
[installing Airflow](https://airflow.apache.org/docs/apache-airflow/stable/installation/),
[getting started](https://airflow.apache.org/docs/apache-airflow/stable/start.html), or walking
through a more complete [tutorial](https://airflow.apache.org/docs/apache-airflow/stable/tutorial/).

> Note: If you're looking for documentation for the main branch (latest development branch): you can find it on [s.apache.org/airflow-docs](https://s.apache.org/airflow-docs/).

For more information on Airflow Improvement Proposals (AIPs), visit
the [Airflow Wiki](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/AIRFLOW/Airflow+Improvement+Proposals).

Documentation for dependent projects like provider distributions, Docker image, Helm Chart, you'll find it in [the documentation index](https://airflow.apache.org/docs/).

## Installing from PyPI

Install Apache Airflow using pip with the `apache-airflow` package. For consistent installations, use the constraint files:

1.  Install just Airflow:

```bash
pip install 'apache-airflow==3.0.6' \
 --constraint "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/apache/airflow/constraints-3.0.6/constraints-3.10.txt"
```

2.  Install with extras (e.g., postgres, google):

```bash
pip install 'apache-airflow[postgres,google]==3.0.6' \
 --constraint "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/apache/airflow/constraints-3.0.6/constraints-3.10.txt"
```

For information on installing provider distributions, check
[providers](http://airflow.apache.org/docs/apache-airflow-providers/index.html).

<!-- End of auto-generated table -->

Limited support versions will be supported with security and critical bug fix only.
EOL versions will not get any fixes nor support.
We always recommend that all users run the latest available minor release for whatever major version is in use.
We **highly** recommend upgrading to the latest Airflow major release at the earliest convenient time and before the EOL date.

## Support for Python and Kubernetes Versions

Airflow supports Python and Kubernetes versions based on their official release schedules, aligning with the
[Python Developer's Guide](https://devguide.python.org/#status-of-python-branches) and
[Kubernetes version skew policy](https://kubernetes.io/docs/setup/release/version-skew-policy/).
