[Apache Airflow](https://airflow.apache.org/docs/apache-airflow/stable/) is a powerful platform for programmatically authoring, scheduling, and monitoring workflows.

**Key Features:**

*   **Workflow-as-Code:** Define workflows (DAGs) in Python, enabling version control, testing, and collaboration.
*   **Dynamic Pipelines:** Utilize code to dynamically generate and parameterize workflows.
*   **Extensible Architecture:** Extend Airflow with a rich set of built-in operators and custom integrations.
*   **Flexible Scheduling:** Schedule tasks with a variety of time-based and event-driven triggers.
*   **Robust Monitoring:** Visualize pipeline runs, monitor progress, and troubleshoot issues through a user-friendly interface.
*   **Idempotent Tasks:** Airflow encourages tasks that produce consistent results without unintended data duplication.
*   **Integration with External Services:** Seamlessly integrate with external services for data processing.

**Project Focus:**

Airflow excels with mostly static and slowly changing workflows.

Other similar projects include [Luigi](https://github.com/spotify/luigi), [Oozie](https://oozie.apache.org/) and [Azkaban](https://azkaban.github.io/).

**Principles:**

*   **Dynamic:** Pipelines are defined in code, enabling dynamic dag generation and parameterization.
*   **Extensible:** The Airflow framework includes a wide range of built-in operators and can be extended to fit your needs.
*   **Flexible:** Airflow leverages the [**Jinja**](https://jinja.palletsprojects.com) templating engine, allowing rich customizations.

## Requirements

Apache Airflow is tested with:

|            | Main version (dev)     | Stable version (3.0.3) |
|------------|------------------------|------------------------|
| Python     | 3.10, 3.11, 3.12, 3.13 | 3.9, 3.10, 3.11, 3.12  |
| Platform   | AMD64/ARM64(\*)        | AMD64/ARM64(\*)        |
| Kubernetes | 1.30, 1.31, 1.32, 1.33 | 1.30, 1.31, 1.32, 1.33 |
| PostgreSQL | 13, 14, 15, 16, 17     | 13, 14, 15, 16, 17     |
| MySQL      | 8.0, 8.4, Innovation   | 8.0, 8.4, Innovation   |
| SQLite     | 3.15.0+                | 3.15.0+                |

\* Experimental

**Note**: MariaDB is not tested/recommended.

**Note**: SQLite is used in Airflow tests. Do not use it in production. We recommend
using the latest stable version of SQLite for local development.

**Note**: Airflow currently can be run on POSIX-compliant Operating Systems. For development, it is regularly
tested on fairly modern Linux Distros and recent versions of macOS.
On Windows you can run it via WSL2 (Windows Subsystem for Linux 2) or via Linux Containers.
The work to add Windows support is tracked via [#10388](https://github.com/apache/airflow/issues/10388), but
it is not a high priority. You should only use Linux-based distros as "Production" execution environment
as this is the only environment that is supported. The only distro that is used in our CI tests and that
is used in the [Community managed DockerHub image](https://hub.docker.com/p/apache/airflow) is
`Debian Bookworm`.

## Getting Started

Refer to the [official Airflow documentation](https://airflow.apache.org/docs/apache-airflow/stable/) for installation, getting started guides, and tutorials.

## Installing from PyPI

Install Apache Airflow using pip, utilizing constraint files for repeatable installations:

```bash

 --constraint "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/apache/airflow/constraints-3.0.3/constraints-3.10.txt"
```

Install with extras:

```bash
pip install 'apache-airflow[postgres,google]==3.0.3' \
 --constraint "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/apache/airflow/constraints-3.0.3/constraints-3.10.txt"

## Support for Python and Kubernetes versions

Airflow follows strict rules for Python and Kubernetes support based on their respective EOL and release schedules.

## Base OS support for reference Airflow images

The Airflow Community provides convenient container images that are published whenever
we publish an Apache Airflow release.

## Approach to dependencies of Airflow

Airflow has a lot of dependencies - direct and transitive, also Airflow is both - library and application,
therefore our policies to dependencies has to include both - stability of installation of application,
but also ability to install newer version of dependencies for those users who develop DAGs. We developed
the approach where `constraints` are used to make sure airflow can be installed in a repeatable way, while
we do not limit our users to upgrade most of the dependencies. As a result we decided not to upper-bound
version of Airflow dependencies by default, unless we have good reasons to believe upper-bounding them is
needed because of importance of the dependency as well as risk it involves to upgrade specific dependency.
We also upper-bound the dependencies that we know cause problems.
