[Apache Airflow](https://github.com/apache/airflow) is a powerful platform for defining, scheduling, and monitoring complex workflows. Built on the principle of "configuration as code," Airflow allows you to create data pipelines that are maintainable, versionable, and easily collaborative.

**Key Features:**

*   **Dynamic:** Define pipelines as code, allowing for dynamic DAG generation and flexible parameterization.
*   **Extensible:** Leverage a wide range of built-in operators and easily extend Airflow to meet specific needs.
*   **Flexible:** Customize your workflows using the Jinja templating engine for rich control.
*   **Scalable:** Execute tasks on an array of workers, enabling scalability for demanding workloads.
*   **User-Friendly UI:** Visualize pipelines, monitor progress, and troubleshoot issues with an intuitive web interface.

**Getting Started:**

*   **Installation:**  Refer to the detailed [INSTALLING.md](INSTALLING.md) file for comprehensive instructions.
*   **Documentation:**  Explore the official Airflow documentation for [installation](https://airflow.apache.org/docs/apache-airflow/stable/installation/), [getting started](https://airflow.apache.org/docs/apache-airflow/stable/start.html), and [tutorials](https://airflow.apache.org/docs/apache-airflow/stable/tutorial/).
*   **Community:**  Join the conversation on [Slack](https://s.apache.org/airflow-slack) and contribute to the project on [GitHub](https://github.com/apache/airflow).

**Core Concepts:**

*   **DAGs (Directed Acyclic Graphs):**  Workflows are defined as code, structured as DAGs.
*   **Operators:** Pre-built components for executing tasks (e.g., running shell commands, interacting with databases).
*   **Schedulers:** Responsible for triggering and managing workflow runs.
*   **Workers:** Execute tasks assigned by the scheduler.
*   **XComs:** Allows tasks to pass metadata to each other.

**Benefits:**

*   **Improved Maintainability:** Workflows defined as code are easier to understand, modify, and maintain.
*   **Increased Collaboration:** Version control and code review facilitate teamwork.
*   **Enhanced Testability:** Unit tests and integration tests ensure workflow reliability.
*   **Simplified Monitoring:**  Airflow's UI provides real-time visibility into pipeline performance.

**Additional Information:**

*   **Official Source Code:**  All official releases are available from the [ASF Distribution Directory](https://downloads.apache.org/airflow).
*   **Installing from PyPI:** Install Airflow via pip: `pip install 'apache-airflow==3.0.3' --constraint "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/apache/airflow/constraints-3.0.3/constraints-3.10.txt"`
