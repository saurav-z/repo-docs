# Apache Airflow: Orchestrate Workflows as Code

**Automate, schedule, and monitor your data pipelines with Apache Airflow, a powerful platform for programmatic workflow management.** ([Original Repo](https://github.com/apache/airflow))

Apache Airflow is a leading open-source platform that empowers users to define, schedule, and monitor complex workflows. By representing workflows as code, Airflow enhances maintainability, version control, testability, and collaboration within your data engineering and data science projects.

**Key Features:**

*   **Dynamic Workflows:** Define pipelines using Python code, enabling dynamic DAG generation and parameterization for maximum flexibility.
*   **Extensibility:** Airflow provides a rich set of built-in operators and is easily extended to meet specific project needs.
*   **Rich UI:** Monitor pipeline progress, troubleshoot issues, and visualize running pipelines through a comprehensive web-based user interface.
*   **Idempotent Tasks:** Designed to encourage idempotent tasks that avoid data duplication and promote data integrity.
*   **Scalability:** Execute tasks on an array of workers, making it suitable for both small and large-scale data processing tasks.
*   **Integrations:** Provides a wide range of integrations with popular data sources, services, and tools, and also can be extended using custom providers.

**Installation and Getting Started:**

*   **Prerequisites:** See the [Requirements](#requirements) section for supported Python versions and more.
*   **Installation:** Install Airflow using `pip`. Consider using constraint files for repeatable installations. See [Installing from PyPI](#installing-from-pypi).
