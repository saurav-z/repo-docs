## Key Features of Apache Airflow:

*   **Dynamic Workflows:** Define pipelines using Python code for flexibility and maintainability.
*   **Extensible Architecture:** Leverage a wide range of built-in operators and customize workflows to suit your specific needs.
*   **Flexible Scheduling:**  Use the built-in scheduler to execute tasks based on dependencies and schedules.
*   **Rich UI:** Visualize, monitor, and troubleshoot pipelines with an intuitive user interface.
*   **Idempotent Tasks:** Airflow works best with idempotent tasks that do not pass large quantities of data from one task to the next, delegating to external services for high-volume, data-intensive tasks.
