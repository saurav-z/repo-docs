# Jupyter Enterprise Gateway: Powering Remote Kernel Access for Enterprise Jupyter Notebooks

Jupyter Enterprise Gateway empowers your Jupyter Notebook environment by enabling the launch and management of remote kernels in distributed clusters.  For more details, visit the original repository:  [Jupyter Enterprise Gateway](https://github.com/jupyter-server/enterprise_gateway).

**Key Features of Jupyter Enterprise Gateway:**

*   **Remote Kernel Launch:** Launches kernels on remote clusters, including support for Apache Spark (YARN), IBM Spectrum Conductor, Kubernetes, and Docker Swarm.
*   **Extensible Framework:** Supports custom kernel launchers for integration with various resource managers and cluster environments.
*   **Supported Kernels:** Provides out-of-the-box support for Python (IPython kernel), R (IRkernel), and Scala (Apache Toree kernel).
*   **Secure Communication:**  Ensures secure communication between the client, Enterprise Gateway, and remote kernels.
*   **Multi-Tenant Capabilities:** Supports multiple users and kernel sessions.
*   **Persistent Kernel Sessions:** Maintains kernel sessions for uninterrupted workflows.
*   **Profile Management:**  Allows associating profiles with kernel configurations for tailored user experiences.
*   **Deployment Diagram:** Includes a [Deployment Diagram](https://github.com/jupyter-server/enterprise_gateway/blob/main/docs/source/images/deployment.png?raw=true) visualizing the architecture.
