# QuACK: High-Performance CUDA Kernels for AI and Deep Learning ðŸ¦†

**Supercharge your AI and deep learning projects with QuACK, a collection of optimized CUDA kernels for lightning-fast performance.** (See the original repository here: [https://github.com/Dao-AILab/quack](https://github.com/Dao-AILab/quack))

## Key Features of QuACK

*   **Optimized for NVIDIA GPUs:** Built using the CuTe-DSL for maximum performance on H100 and B200 GPUs.
*   **Comprehensive Kernel Suite:** Includes crucial kernels for deep learning tasks.
    *   RMSNorm (forward & backward)
    *   Softmax (forward & backward)
    *   Cross Entropy (forward & backward)
    *   LayerNorm (forward)
    *   Hopper GEMM + Epilogue
    *   Blackwell GEMM + Epilogue
*   **Easy to Use:** Simple Python interface for seamless integration into your existing projects.

## Installation

Install QuACK kernels with a single command:

```bash
pip install quack-kernels
```

## Requirements

*   NVIDIA H100 or B200 GPU
*   CUDA Toolkit 12.9+
*   Python 3.12

## Usage Example

Import and utilize QuACK kernels effortlessly:

```python
from quack import rmsnorm, softmax, cross_entropy
```
