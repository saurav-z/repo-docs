# QuACK: High-Performance CUDA Kernels for AI Acceleration üöÄ

**Supercharge your AI workflows with QuACK, a collection of optimized CUDA kernels built using the CuTe-DSL!** [View the original repository](https://github.com/Dao-AILab/quack).

## Key Features

*   **Optimized Kernels:** Provides high-performance implementations of essential AI operations.
*   **Built with CuTe-DSL:** Leverages the power and flexibility of the CuTe Domain-Specific Language for optimal kernel performance.
*   **Easy Installation:** Simple pip install for quick setup.
*   **Comprehensive Coverage:** Includes forward and backward passes for common operations.

## Available Kernels üê•

*   ü¶Ü RMSNorm (forward + backward)
*   ü¶Ü Softmax (forward + backward)
*   ü¶Ü Cross Entropy (forward + backward)
*   ü¶Ü Layernorm (forward)
*   ü¶Ü Rotary (forward + backward) - *Upcoming*

## Installation

Install QuACK using pip:

```bash
pip install quack-kernels
```

## Requirements

Ensure your system meets these requirements:

*   **GPU:** H100 or B200
*   **CUDA:** CUDA toolkit 12.9+
*   **Python:** Python 3.12

## Usage

Import and utilize QuACK kernels in your Python code:

```python
from quack import rmsnorm, softmax, cross_entropy
```
