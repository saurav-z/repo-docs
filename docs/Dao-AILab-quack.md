# QuACK: Unleash Blazing-Fast CUDA Kernels with CuTe ðŸš€

**Supercharge your deep learning projects with QuACK, a library of high-performance CUDA kernels meticulously crafted using the CuTe-DSL.**  [See the original repository here](https://github.com/Dao-AILab/quack).

## Key Features:

*   **Optimized Kernels:** Benefit from highly optimized CUDA kernels for common deep learning operations.
*   **CuTe-DSL Powered:**  Leverages the CuTe-DSL for efficient kernel development and customization.
*   **Broad Coverage:** Includes kernels for RMSNorm, Softmax, Cross Entropy, LayerNorm, and GEMM operations.
*   **Hopper and Blackwell Architecture Support:** Optimized for NVIDIA Hopper and Blackwell GPUs.
*   **Easy Integration:**  Simple Python API for seamless integration into your existing workflows.

## Installation:

Get started with QuACK in seconds:

```bash
pip install quack-kernels
```

## Requirements:

Ensure your system meets the following requirements:

*   NVIDIA H100 or B200 GPU
*   CUDA Toolkit 12.9+
*   Python 3.12

## Available Kernels:

QuACK provides a suite of high-performance kernels:

*   ðŸ¦† RMSNorm (forward + backward)
*   ðŸ¦† Softmax (forward + backward)
*   ðŸ¦† Cross Entropy (forward + backward)
*   ðŸ¦† Layernorm (forward)
*   ðŸ¦† Hopper GEMM + Epilogue
*   ðŸ¦† Blackwell GEMM + Epilogue

## Usage Example:

Easily import and use QuACK kernels in your Python code:

```python
from quack import rmsnorm, softmax, cross_entropy
```

## Performance & Benchmarks:
