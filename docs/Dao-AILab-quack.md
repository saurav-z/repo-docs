# ðŸ¦† QuACK: Unleash Lightning-Fast Kernels with CuTe ðŸ¦†

**Supercharge your AI workloads with QuACK, a collection of optimized kernels written in the CuTe-DSL, delivering unparalleled performance for your H100 and B200 GPUs!**  For the original repository, see [Dao-AILab/quack](https://github.com/Dao-AILab/quack).

## Key Features

*   **Optimized Kernels:** Pre-built kernels for common AI operations, including:
    *   RMSNorm (forward & backward)
    *   Softmax (forward & backward)
    *   Cross Entropy (forward & backward)
    *   LayerNorm (forward)
*   **CuTe-DSL Powered:** Kernels are built using the CuTe-DSL, enabling high performance and customization.
*   **Easy Installation:** Simple pip installation for quick setup.
*   **Python Integration:** Seamlessly integrate QuACK kernels into your Python projects.
*   **Future-Proof:** Actively developed with upcoming features, including Rotary kernels.

## Installation

Get started with QuACK in seconds:

```bash
pip install quack-kernels
```

## Requirements

Ensure your environment meets the following:

*   NVIDIA H100 or B200 GPU
*   CUDA Toolkit 12.9 or later
*   Python 3.12

## Usage

Easily integrate QuACK kernels into your Python code:

```python
from quack import rmsnorm, softmax, cross_entropy
```
