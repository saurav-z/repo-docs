## Key Features

*   **Optimized Kernels:** Leveraging the power of CuTe-DSL for maximum performance.
*   **Wide Kernel Coverage:** Includes essential kernels for modern AI tasks.
    *   RMSNorm (forward & backward)
    *   Softmax (forward & backward)
    *   Cross Entropy (forward & backward)
    *   Layernorm (forward)
    *   Hopper GEMM + Epilogue
    *   Blackwell GEMM + Epilogue
*   **Easy Integration:** Simple Python API for seamless integration into your existing projects.

## Installation

Install QuACK with a single pip command:

```bash
pip install quack-kernels
```

## Requirements

*   **GPU:** H100 or B200
*   **CUDA Toolkit:** CUDA toolkit 12.9+
*   **Python:** Python 3.12

## Usage

Import and use QuACK kernels directly in your Python code:

```python
from quack import rmsnorm, softmax, cross_entropy
```
