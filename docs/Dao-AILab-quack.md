# ðŸ¦† QuACK: Blazing-Fast Kernels for Your AI Projects ðŸ¦†

**Supercharge your AI workloads with QuACK, a collection of high-performance kernels meticulously crafted using the CuTe-DSL.**  [View the original repo](https://github.com/Dao-AILab/quack).

## Key Features

*   **Optimized for NVIDIA GPUs:** Leverages the power of H100 and B200 GPUs for peak performance.
*   **CuTe-DSL Implementation:**  Kernels are written in the CuTe-DSL for efficient execution.
*   **Easy Installation:** Install with a simple `pip install`.
*   **Ready-to-Use Kernels:** Includes essential AI kernels for common tasks.

## Kernels Included

*   RMSNorm (Forward + Backward)
*   Softmax (Forward + Backward)
*   Cross Entropy (Forward + Backward)
*   Layernorm (Forward)
*   Upcoming: Rotary (Forward + Backward)

## Requirements

*   NVIDIA H100 or B200 GPU
*   CUDA Toolkit 12.9+
*   Python 3.12

## Installation

```bash
pip install quack-kernels
```

## Usage Example

```python
from quack import rmsnorm, softmax, cross_entropy
```
