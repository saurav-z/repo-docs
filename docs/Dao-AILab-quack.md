# QuACK: High-Performance Kernels for NVIDIA GPUs ðŸ¦†

**Supercharge your AI workloads with QuACK, a library of highly optimized kernels designed for NVIDIA H100 and B200 GPUs, written in the powerful CuTe-DSL.** ([Original Repository](https://github.com/Dao-AILab/quack))

## Key Features

*   **Optimized Kernels:**  Leverage hand-tuned kernels for critical operations, delivering significant performance gains.
*   **CuTe-DSL Based:**  Built using the CuTe-DSL, enabling efficient and flexible kernel development.
*   **Easy Installation:** Simple pip installation makes getting started a breeze.
*   **Diverse Kernel Suite:** Includes kernels for essential deep learning operations, like:
    *   RMSNorm (forward + backward)
    *   Softmax (forward + backward)
    *   Cross Entropy (forward + backward)
    *   LayerNorm (forward)
    *   Hopper GEMM + Epilogue
    *   Blackwell GEMM + Epilogue

## Installation

```bash
pip install quack-kernels
```

## Requirements

*   NVIDIA H100 or B200 GPU
*   CUDA Toolkit 12.9+
*   Python 3.12

## Usage

Get started quickly in your Python code:

```python
from quack import rmsnorm, softmax, cross_entropy
```
