# ü¶Ü QuACK: Unleash Lightning-Fast CUDA Kernels with CuTe-DSL ü¶Ü

**Accelerate your machine learning workloads with QuACK, a collection of high-performance CUDA kernels meticulously crafted using the CuTe-DSL!** ([Original Repo](https://github.com/Dao-AILab/quack))

## Key Features

*   **Optimized Kernels:** Experience blazing-fast performance with kernels optimized for modern NVIDIA GPUs.
*   **CuTe-DSL Powered:** Built with the CuTe-DSL for elegant and efficient kernel implementations.
*   **Easy Installation:**  Get started quickly with a simple pip install.
*   **Python-Friendly:**  Seamlessly integrate QuACK into your Python projects.

## Available Kernels üê•

QuACK currently offers optimized implementations for the following:

*   ü¶Ü RMSNorm (Forward & Backward)
*   ü¶Ü Softmax (Forward & Backward)
*   ü¶Ü Cross Entropy (Forward & Backward)
*   ü¶Ü Layernorm (Forward)

**Upcoming:**

*   ü¶Ü Rotary (Forward & Backward)

## Installation

Install QuACK using pip:

```bash
pip install quack-kernels
```

## Requirements

Ensure your system meets the following requirements:

*   NVIDIA H100 or B200 GPU
*   CUDA Toolkit 12.9+
*   Python 3.12

## Usage

Import and utilize QuACK kernels directly in your Python code:

```python
from quack import rmsnorm, softmax, cross_entropy
```

## Performance

QuACK kernels are engineered for peak performance.  Detailed benchmark results can be found in the blog post linked below.
