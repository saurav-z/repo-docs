## Key Features of QuACK

*   **Optimized Kernels:** Leverage highly optimized kernels for key operations, accelerating your AI model training and inference.
*   **Built with CuTe-DSL:** Kernels are crafted using the CuTe-DSL, enabling efficient use of modern GPU hardware.
*   **Easy to Use:** Simple Python interface allows for quick integration into your existing projects.
*   **Focus on Performance:** Designed for maximum performance, with benchmarks demonstrating significant speedups.

## Kernels Included

QuACK currently offers the following kernels:

*   ðŸ¦† RMSNorm forward + backward
*   ðŸ¦† Softmax forward + backward
*   ðŸ¦† Cross entropy forward + backward
*   ðŸ¦† Layernorm forward
*   Upcoming: ðŸ¦† Rotary forward + backward

## Installation

Get started quickly with a simple pip install:

```bash
pip install quack-kernels
```

## Requirements

Ensure you have the following to get the most out of QuACK:

*   H100 or B200 GPU
*   CUDA toolkit 12.9+
*   Python 3.12

## Usage Example

Import and use QuACK kernels directly in your Python code:

```python
from quack import rmsnorm, softmax, cross_entropy
```

## Performance and Benchmarks

QuACK is engineered for performance. See the following figure demonstrating the speedups achieved:
