# Model Context Protocol (MCP) Servers: Unlock Powerful LLM Integrations

**Connect Large Language Models (LLMs) to tools and data with secure, controlled access using the Model Context Protocol (MCP).** Explore a comprehensive collection of reference and community-built servers to enhance your AI applications. View the original repo here: [https://github.com/modelcontextprotocol/servers](https://github.com/modelcontextprotocol/servers)

**Key Features:**

*   **Reference Implementations:** Explore the versatility of MCP with example servers built using official SDKs.
*   **Community-Driven:** Discover a wide range of community-developed servers, extending MCP capabilities across various domains.
*   **Secure Access:** Grant your LLMs controlled and secure access to tools and data sources.
*   **Extensible:** Easily adapt and extend MCP to fit your specific needs.
*   **Open Source:** Built in partnership with Anthropic and open to community contributions.

## üöÄ Getting Started

### Running Reference Servers
Use `npx`, `uvx`, or `pip` to quickly launch reference servers.

**Example: Running the Memory Server (TypeScript)**
```bash
npx -y @modelcontextprotocol/server-memory
```

**Example: Running the Git Server (Python)**
```bash
# With uvx (Recommended)
uvx mcp-server-git

# With pip
pip install mcp-server-git
python -m mcp_server_git
```

### Configuring an MCP Client
Integrate servers with your MCP client (e.g., Claude Desktop) using configuration files.

**Example: Claude Desktop Configuration**
```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "memory": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": ["-y", "@modelcontextprotocol/server-memory"]
    }
  }
}
```
