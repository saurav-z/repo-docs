# Model Context Protocol Servers: Unleash the Power of AI with Secure Tool Access

**Empower your Large Language Models (LLMs) with secure and controlled access to tools and data sources using the Model Context Protocol (MCP).** This repository provides reference implementations and a vibrant community of servers, enabling you to extend the capabilities of your AI applications. Explore the **[original repository](https://github.com/modelcontextprotocol/servers)** for more details.

## Key Features

*   **Reference Implementations:** Explore working examples of MCP servers, showcasing the protocol's versatility.
*   **SDK Support:** Utilize official SDKs for [C#](https://github.com/modelcontextprotocol/csharp-sdk), [Java](https://github.com/modelcontextprotocol/java-sdk), [Kotlin](https://github.com/modelcontextprotocol/kotlin-sdk), [Python](https://github.com/modelcontextprotocol/python-sdk), and [Typescript](https://github.com/modelcontextprotocol/typescript-sdk).
*   **Extensible & Versatile:** Build MCP servers for a wide range of use cases, from web content fetching to secure file operations and complex integrations.
*   **Community-Driven Ecosystem:** Benefit from a growing collection of third-party servers, including official integrations and community contributions.

## üöÄ Getting Started

Get up and running with MCP servers quickly.

### Using MCP Servers in this Repository

**For Typescript-based servers, use `npx`:**

```bash
npx -y @modelcontextprotocol/server-memory
```

**For Python-based servers, use `uvx` or `pip`:**

```bash
# Using uvx
uvx mcp-server-git

# Using pip
pip install mcp-server-git
python -m mcp_server_git
```

### Configuring an MCP Client

Integrate MCP servers into your preferred client (like Claude Desktop) using configuration files.

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "memory": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": ["-y", "@modelcontextprotocol/server-memory"]
    }
  }
}
```

## üåü Reference Servers

These servers demonstrate the core functionality of MCP and the use of the official SDKs:

*   **Everything:** A versatile test server with prompts, resources, and tools.
*   **Fetch:** Retrieves and converts web content for efficient LLM use.
*   **Filesystem:** Provides secure file operations with access control.
*   **Git:** Offers tools for interacting with Git repositories.
*   **Memory:** Utilizes a knowledge graph for persistent memory.
*   **Sequential Thinking:** Facilitates dynamic problem-solving through thought sequences.
*   **Time:** Converts time and timezone information.
