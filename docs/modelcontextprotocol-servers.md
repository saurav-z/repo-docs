# Model Context Protocol (MCP) Server Implementations: Empowering LLMs with Secure Tool Access

**Unlock the power of Large Language Models by providing them with secure, controlled access to external tools and data sources using the Model Context Protocol (MCP).** Explore the versatility of MCP with these reference implementations and a thriving community of developers building innovative servers.  [Access the original repository here](https://github.com/modelcontextprotocol/servers).

## Key Features:

*   **Reference Implementations:** Explore a collection of example MCP servers demonstrating diverse functionalities.
*   **SDK Support:** Leverage official SDKs in multiple languages for easy server development:
    *   C# MCP SDK
    *   Go MCP SDK
    *   Java MCP SDK
    *   Kotlin MCP SDK
    *   Python MCP SDK
    *   Ruby MCP SDK
    *   Rust MCP SDK
    *   Swift MCP SDK
    *   TypeScript MCP SDK
*   **Community-Driven Ecosystem:** Discover a rapidly growing community of third-party servers and resources.

## Reference Servers:

These servers showcase the core features of MCP and the official SDKs.

*   **Everything:** A comprehensive test server with prompts, resources, and tools.
*   **Fetch:** Retrieves and converts web content for efficient LLM usage.
*   **Filesystem:** Offers secure file operations with configurable access controls.
*   **Git:** Provides tools for interacting with Git repositories (read, search, manipulate).
*   **Memory:** Implements a knowledge graph-based persistent memory system.
*   **Sequential Thinking:** Enables dynamic, reflective problem-solving through thought sequences.
*   **Time:** Includes time and timezone conversion capabilities.

## Third-Party Servers:

### üéñÔ∏è Official Integrations

Leverage these integrations maintained by companies to connect your agents to production-ready MCP servers.

*   **(Logos and descriptions for each are included in the original README.md, but removed for brevity here. This would include all of the logos and descriptions for the official integrations listed in the original README.)**

### üåé Community Servers

Discover and experiment with a wide range of community-developed MCP servers.

> [!NOTE]
> Community servers are **untested** and should be used at **your own risk**. They are not affiliated with or endorsed by Anthropic.

*   **(List of Community Servers included in the original README.md, but removed for brevity here.)**

## üöÄ Getting Started

1.  **Using Servers:**
    *   TypeScript-based servers can be run using `npx`:
        ```bash
        npx -y @modelcontextprotocol/server-memory
        ```
    *   Python-based servers can be run using `uvx` or `pip`:
        ```bash
        # With uvx
        uvx mcp-server-git

        # With pip
        pip install mcp-server-git
        python -m mcp_server_git
        ```
2.  **Using an MCP Client:** Configure your MCP client (e.g., Claude Desktop) to use the server by specifying the command and any necessary arguments.  For example:
    ```json
    {
      "mcpServers": {
        "memory": {
          "command": "npx",
          "args": ["-y", "@modelcontextprotocol/server-memory"]
        }
      }
    }
    ```
