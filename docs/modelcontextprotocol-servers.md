# Model Context Protocol (MCP) Servers: Unlock AI Agent Capabilities

**Use the Model Context Protocol (MCP) to give Large Language Models (LLMs) secure, controlled access to tools and data sources.** This repository provides a collection of reference implementations and community-built servers to extend and showcase MCP's versatility.  [Explore the original repository here](https://github.com/modelcontextprotocol/servers).

## Key Features

*   **Reference Implementations:** Explore examples demonstrating how to build MCP servers.
*   **Community-Driven:** Benefit from a growing ecosystem of servers created and maintained by the community.
*   **Secure Access:** Enable controlled and secure access to tools and data for LLMs.
*   **Extensible:**  Easily integrate new tools and data sources to expand your AI agent's capabilities.

## Quick Start

### Using MCP Servers in this Repository

#### TypeScript Servers:

Run TypeScript-based servers directly using `npx`:

```bash
npx -y @modelcontextprotocol/server-memory
```

#### Python Servers:

Run Python-based servers using [`uvx`](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/concepts/tools/) or [`pip`](https://pypi.org/project/pip/).  `uvx` is recommended for ease of setup.

```bash
# With uvx
uvx mcp-server-git

# With pip
pip install mcp-server-git
python -m mcp_server_git
```

### Using an MCP Client

To use a server, configure it within an MCP client.  For example, here's how to configure Claude Desktop to use the Memory server:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "memory": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": ["-y", "@modelcontextprotocol/server-memory"]
    }
  }
}
```
(Refer to the original README for other examples.)

## Reference Servers

*   **Everything:**  Reference / test server with prompts, resources, and tools
*   **Fetch:** Web content fetching and conversion
*   **Filesystem:** Secure file operations with access controls
*   **Git:** Git repository interaction
*   **Memory:** Knowledge graph-based persistent memory
*   **Sequential Thinking:** Dynamic problem-solving with thought sequences
*   **Time:** Time and timezone conversion
