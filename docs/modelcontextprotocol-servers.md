# Model Context Protocol Servers: Empowering AI with Controlled Tool Access

Unlock the potential of Large Language Models (LLMs) by giving them secure and controlled access to tools and data using Model Context Protocol (MCP). This repository, ([original repo](https://github.com/modelcontextprotocol/servers)), offers a collection of reference implementations, community-built servers, and helpful resources to help you build powerful AI-driven applications.

**Key Features:**

*   **Reference Implementations:** Explore example servers showcasing MCP's versatility.
*   **Community-Built Servers:** Discover a growing ecosystem of servers across various domains, expanding the capabilities of AI assistants.
*   **SDK Support:** Leverage official MCP SDKs for various languages including:
    *   C#
    *   Go
    *   Java
    *   Kotlin
    *   Python
    *   Typescript
*   **Secure Tool Access:** Grant LLMs controlled access to tools and data sources, ensuring safety and responsible AI usage.

## üåü Reference Servers

These servers demonstrate core MCP features and showcase the official SDKs.

## üöÄ Getting Started

### Using MCP Servers

*   **Typescript Servers:** Use `npx` to start servers. Example: `npx -y @modelcontextprotocol/server-memory`
*   **Python Servers:** Use `uvx` (recommended) or `pip`. Example (with `uvx`): `uvx mcp-server-git` or (with `pip`): `pip install mcp-server-git && python -m mcp_server_git`.

### Using an MCP Client

Configure your client (e.g., Claude Desktop) by adding server details to its configuration file. Examples provided in the original README.
