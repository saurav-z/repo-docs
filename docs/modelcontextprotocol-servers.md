### üöÄ Running MCP Servers

Here's how to get started using the provided servers with tools such as Claude Desktop.

**Using TypeScript-based servers:**
```bash
npx -y @modelcontextprotocol/server-memory
```
**Using Python-based servers**
```bash
# With uvx
uvx mcp-server-git
# With pip
pip install mcp-server-git
python -m mcp_server_git
```

Configure your MCP client to use the server:
```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "memory": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": ["-y", "@modelcontextprotocol/server-memory"]
    }
  }
}
```
