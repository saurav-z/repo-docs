# Model Context Protocol Servers: Empowering LLMs with Secure Tool Access

Unlock the potential of Large Language Models (LLMs) by providing them with secure and controlled access to tools and data using Model Context Protocol (MCP).  This repository hosts reference implementations and a vibrant ecosystem of community-built servers.  Explore the [Model Context Protocol](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/) to learn more.

**[Visit the original repo](https://github.com/modelcontextprotocol/servers) for the latest updates and contributions.**

## ü§ù Third-Party Servers: Expanding the Ecosystem

### üéñÔ∏è Official Integrations: Production-Ready Solutions

These integrations are maintained by companies providing production-ready MCP servers for their platforms.

*   *   ... (List of official integrations, incorporating the HTML-based approach for logos to be SEO-friendly and accessible.)
    *   Replace existing logo icons with this markdown structure to enhance SEO.  Example:
    *   `<img height="12" width="12" src="https://www.21st.dev/favicon.ico" alt="21st.dev Logo" /> [21st.dev Magic](https://github.com/21st-dev/magic-mcp)`
    *   Continue the pattern for all the official integrations.

### üåé Community Servers:  Extending Functionality

A large and growing collection of community-developed servers is available.  **Note:** Community servers are **untested** and should be used at **your own risk**. They are not affiliated with or endorsed by Anthropic.

## üöÄ Getting Started:  Quick Deployment

### Running Servers

Typescript-based servers (e.g., [Memory](src/memory)) can be run using `npx`:

```bash
npx -y @modelcontextprotocol/server-memory
```

Python-based servers (e.g., [Git](src/git)) can be started using [`uvx`](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/concepts/tools/) or [`pip`](https://pypi.org/project/pip/) and `python`:

```bash
uvx mcp-server-git
# OR
pip install mcp-server-git
python -m mcp_server_git
```

### Connecting with an MCP Client

Configure your MCP client (e.g., Claude Desktop) to use a server:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "memory": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": ["-y", "@modelcontextprotocol/server-memory"]
    }
  }
}
```
