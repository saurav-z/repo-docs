# Model Context Protocol Servers: Empowering AI with Secure and Controlled Tool Access

**Unlock the power of Large Language Models (LLMs) by giving them secure and controlled access to tools and data sources.** This repository provides a collection of reference implementations for the [Model Context Protocol (MCP)](https://github.com/modelcontextprotocol/servers), a groundbreaking standard for enabling LLMs to interact with external systems.

## Key Features:

*   **Reference Implementations:** Explore a variety of reference servers showcasing the versatility of MCP.
*   **Comprehensive SDKs:** Leverage official SDKs for [C#](https://github.com/modelcontextprotocol/csharp-sdk), [Go](https://github.com/modelcontextprotocol/go-sdk), [Java](https://github.com/modelcontextprotocol/java-sdk), [Kotlin](https://github.com/modelcontextprotocol/kotlin-sdk), [Python](https://github.com/modelcontextprotocol/python-sdk), and [Typescript](https://github.com/modelcontextprotocol/typescript-sdk) to build your own MCP servers.
*   **Community-Driven:** Benefit from a vibrant ecosystem of community-built servers, expanding the capabilities of MCP across diverse domains.
*   **Secure and Controlled Access:** Enable secure, controlled access to tools and data for LLMs, enhancing their functionality while maintaining data integrity.

## üåü Reference Servers:

These servers demonstrate MCP features and usage with the official SDKs.

*   **Everything:** Test server with diverse prompts, resources, and tools.
*   **Fetch:** Retrieves and converts web content for optimized LLM use.
*   **Filesystem:** Secure file operations with access controls.
*   **Git:** Reads, searches, and manipulates Git repositories.
*   **Memory:** Persistent memory system utilizing a knowledge graph.
