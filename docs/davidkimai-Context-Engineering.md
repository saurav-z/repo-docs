## What is Context Engineering?

Context Engineering is the discipline of designing and managing the complete information payload provided to a large language model (LLM) at inference time. It goes beyond simple prompt design to encompass:

*   **Information Selection & Organization:** Structuring the information the LLM receives.
*   **Memory Management:**  Creating and utilizing memory systems for coherent conversations and complex tasks.
*   **Tool Integration:** Leveraging external tools and APIs to extend the LLM's capabilities.
*   **Multi-Agent Orchestration:** Coordinating multiple LLMs or agents to achieve complex goals.
*   **Continuous Learning:**  Enabling self-improvement and adaptation.
