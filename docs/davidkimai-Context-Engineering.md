# Context Engineering: Master the Art of Guiding AI with Advanced Context Design

Unlock the full potential of large language models (LLMs) by moving beyond basic prompts and mastering **Context Engineering** â€“ the practice of meticulously crafting the complete information payload to guide AI interactions. This repository provides a comprehensive, first-principles approach to context design, orchestration, and optimization, taking inspiration from the work of [David Kimai](https://github.com/davidkimai/Context-Engineering).

**Key Features:**

*   **Foundational Principles:** Learn the core concepts of context engineering, starting with the building blocks of prompts and progressing to advanced techniques.
*   **Hands-on Guides & Tutorials:** Practical, step-by-step guides, and Jupyter Notebook style examples to help you implement various context engineering strategies.
*   **Reusable Templates & Components:** Pre-built templates and components to streamline your projects, including prompt structures, orchestration tools, and evaluation metrics.
*   **Real-World Examples:** Explore practical implementations like data annotation, multi-agent systems, and integration with IDEs.
*   **Deep Dive Documentation:** Comprehensive documentation covering token budgeting, retrieval system design, cognitive patterns, and more.
*   **Community Contribution:**  Get involved with the community.
