# Context Engineering: Mastering the Art and Science of LLM Context

**Go beyond prompt engineering and unlock the full potential of Large Language Models (LLMs) by mastering the art of context design, orchestration, and optimization!**  Explore the original repository on [GitHub](https://github.com/davidkimai/Context-Engineering) to dive deeper into this innovative field.

> *"Context engineering is the delicate art and science of filling the context window with just the right information for the next step."* â€” [Andrej Karpathy](https://x.com/karpathy/status/1937902205765607626)

## Key Features

## What is Context Engineering?

Context engineering focuses on everything an LLM sees at inference time, moving beyond simple prompts.  It encompasses:

*   Examples
*   Memory
*   Retrieval
*   Tools
*   State
*   Control Flow

## Core Concepts

*   **Token Budgeting:** Optimize costs and improve performance.
*   **Few-Shot Learning:**  Teach LLMs with examples.
*   **Memory Systems:**  Enable stateful and coherent interactions.
*   **Retrieval Augmentation (RAG):** Ground responses in facts and reduce hallucinations.
*   **Control Flow:**  Break down complex tasks for effective execution.
*   **Context Pruning:** Remove irrelevant information.
*   **Metrics & Evaluation:**  Measure and optimize context effectiveness.
*   **Cognitive Tools & Prompt Programming:** Build custom tools and templates.
*   **Neural Field Theory:** Model context as dynamic fields for iterative updating.
*   **Symbolic Mechanisms:** Leverage architectures for higher-order reasoning.
*   **Quantum Semantics:** Leverage superpositional techniques.

## Why Context Engineering Matters

By mastering context, you can significantly enhance:

*   Accuracy
*   Efficiency
*   Reasoning Capabilities
*   Overall performance of your LLM applications.
