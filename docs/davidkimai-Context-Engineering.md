## Research Insights:

This repository is informed by the latest research, including:

### Memory + Reasoning:

*   [MEM1: Learning to Synergize Memory and Reasoning for Efficient Long-Horizon Agents](https://www.arxiv.org/pdf/2506.15841) - MEM1 trains AI agents to keep only what matters—merging memory and reasoning at every step—so they never get overwhelmed, no matter how long the task.

### Cognitive Tools:

*   [Eliciting Reasoning in Language Models with Cognitive Tools](https://www.arxiv.org/pdf/2506.12115) - This research shows that breaking complex tasks into modular “cognitive tools” lets AI solve problems more thoughtfully.

### Emergent Symbols:

*   [Emergent Symbolic Mechanisms Support Abstract Reasoning in Large Language Models](https://openreview.net/forum?id=y1SnRPDWx4) - This paper proves that large language models develop their own inner symbolic “logic circuits”—enabling them to reason with abstract variables.

## Getting Started:

1.  **Explore the Foundations:** Start with the fundamental concepts in `00_foundations/`.
2.  **Experiment with Examples:** Get hands-on with `10_guides_zero_to_one/` and `30_examples/`.
3.  **Contribute and Learn:** Join the community and help shape the future of context engineering!
