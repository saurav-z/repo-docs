# Context Engineering: Unlock the Power of the Context Window

**Context Engineering is the art and science of optimizing the information provided to a large language model (LLM) to enhance its performance and capabilities, offering a strategic advantage over basic prompt engineering.** Explore the practical application of cutting-edge research in LLM context design, orchestration, and optimization.  [Visit the original repository](https://github.com/davidkimai/Context-Engineering) for detailed insights.

*   **Research-Backed:** Based on cutting-edge research from institutions like IBM Zurich, Princeton, and MIT.

## What is Context Engineering?

This repository explores the distinction between prompt engineering and context engineering. While prompt engineering focuses on crafting the initial instruction, context engineering encompasses everything else the model sees, including examples, memory, retrieval, tools, state, and control flow.

```
                    Prompt Engineering  │  Context Engineering
                       ↓                │            ↓                      
               "What you say"           │  "Everything else the model sees"
             (Single instruction)       │    (Examples, memory, retrieval,
                                        │     tools, state, control flow)
```

## Why Context Engineering?

Move beyond prompts and master the entire context window. This allows you to guide thought and unlock the true power of LLMs.

## Core Concepts

*   **Token Budget:** Optimizing the token usage within the context window.
*   **Few-Shot Learning:** Providing examples to teach the model.
*   **Memory Systems:** Enabling stateful and coherent interactions.
*   **Retrieval Augmentation:** Integrating relevant documents to reduce hallucination.
*   **Cognitive Tools:** Integrating prompt programs within the LLM.
*   **Neural Field Theory:** Modeling context as a dynamic neural field.
*   **Symbolic Mechanisms:** Enhancing reasoning with symbolic structures.
