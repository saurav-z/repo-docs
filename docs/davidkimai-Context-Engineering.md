## Why Context Engineering Matters

Context engineering transforms LLMs from simple instruction followers into powerful problem-solvers.  It goes beyond the prompt to encompass all the information a model sees, including examples, memory, retrieval, tools, and control flow.

## Learning Path Overview

*   **Foundations:** Core concepts and theory.
*   **Guides:** Practical, hands-on examples.
*   **Templates:** Reusable components.
*   **Examples:** Real-world project implementations.
*   **Reference:** Deep-dive documentation.

## Quick Start

1.  **Explore Foundations:** Begin by reading the 01_atoms_prompting.md to understand why prompts alone often underperform.
2.  **Run Example:** Experiment with a minimal working example using the Jupyter Notebook style 01_min_prompt.py.
3.  **Experiment with Templates:** Get a feel for the skeleton using the 20_templates/minimal_context.yaml
4.  **See a complete implementation with context management:** Study 30_examples/00_toy_chatbot/
