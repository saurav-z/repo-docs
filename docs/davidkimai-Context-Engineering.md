# Context Engineering: Master the Art of Guiding LLMs

**Context engineering is the art and science of curating the perfect information within the context window for the best outcomes.**  This repository provides a practical, first-principles approach to context design, orchestration, and optimization, moving beyond basic prompt engineering.  Learn how to craft superior LLM experiences by mastering the entire context window, not just the prompt.  [Explore the original repository here](https://github.com/davidkimai/Context-Engineering).

**Key Features:**

*   **Comprehensive Approach:**  Move beyond simple prompts to engineer the entire context window, including examples, memory, retrieval, tools, and control flow.
*   **First-Principles Handbook:**  Gain a practical, biological-inspired approach to context engineering.
*   **Progressive Learning Path:**  Follow a structured, step-by-step learning path, starting with the fundamentals and advancing to complex implementations.
*   **Hands-on Tutorials:**  Experiment with minimal working examples and progressively complex projects.
*   **Real-World Examples:**  Learn from and adapt practical implementations of data annotation, multi-agent orchestration, IDE integration and more.
*   **Reusable Templates:**  Utilize pre-built components and templates to accelerate your development.
*   **Cutting-Edge Research:** Leverage the latest research from institutions like IBM Zurich, Princeton, and MIT.
*   **Cognitive Tooling:** Learn to implement prompt programs and custom tools that orchestrate and enhance LLM reasoning and output.

## Why Context Engineering Matters

Prompt engineering has received all the attention, but the real power lies in mastering the context window. This is where you can guide the LLM's "thought" process. This repository provides a first-principles approach built around a biological metaphor:

```
atoms → molecules → cells → organs → neural systems → neural & semantic field theory 
  │        │         │         │             │                         │        
single    few-     memory +   multi-   cognitive tools +     context = fields +
prompt    shot     agents     agents   operating systems     persistence & resonance
```

**Key Research Highlights & Evidence**

*   **Memory + Reasoning**:  Learn from MEM1 research (Singapore-MIT, June 2025) agents keep the best information at every step.
*   **Cognitive Tools**: Utilize structured prompt templates as cognitive tools, unlocking sophisticated reasoning (IBM Zurich, June 2025).
*   **Emergent Symbols**:  Understand how LLMs create inner, symbolic "logic circuits" to reason abstractly (ICML Princeton, June 2025).

## Quick Start Guide

1.  **Foundations:**  Start with `00_foundations/01_atoms_prompting.md` to understand the basic concepts.
2.  **Experiment:**  Run `10_guides_zero_to_one/01_min_prompt.ipynb` for a minimal example.
3.  **Adapt:** Explore `20_templates/minimal_context.yaml` and copy the core template to your projects.
4.  **Explore:** Study `30_examples/00_toy_chatbot/` to see a complete, working implementation.
