**Context Engineering is the art and science of designing the optimal information environment for Large Language Models (LLMs), moving beyond simple prompt engineering to unlock advanced capabilities.** Dive into a first-principles approach to mastering context, exploring techniques for memory, retrieval, and orchestration to build more intelligent and robust LLM applications. Check out the original repository for the latest updates: [Context Engineering](https://github.com/davidkimai/Context-Engineering).

**Key Features:**

*   **Comprehensive Handbook:** A practical guide to context design, orchestration, and optimization.
*   **First-Principles Approach:** Learn from the ground up, building a solid understanding of core concepts.
*   **Hands-on Tutorials:** Get started quickly with a series of runnable examples and tutorials.
*   **Advanced Techniques:** Explore memory systems, retrieval augmentation, control flow, and more.
*   **Community-Driven:** Benefit from contributions and insights from a growing community of practitioners.

**What You'll Learn**
The following concepts will be covered by this repository

*   **Token Budget:** Optimize how much is included within the context
*   **Few-Shot Learning:** Demonstrate examples to the model for enhanced performance
*   **Memory Systems:** Persist information across interactions
*   **Retrieval Augmentation:** Integrate relevant documentation to improve accuracy
*   **Control Flow:** Break down complex tasks using code-based processes
*   **Context Pruning:** Remove extraneous information for improved efficiency
*   **Metrics & Evaluation:** Measure the effectiveness of different techniques
*   **Cognitive Tools & Prompt Programming:** Design custom tools and templates for improved performance
*   **Neural Field Theory:** Model context with a field-based dynamic
*   **Symbolic Mechanisms:** Apply symbolic architectures to reason more effectively
*   **Quantum Semantics:** Design context systems leveraging superpositional techniques

### Diving into Research

This repository leverages the work of many researchers as the foundation for building more advanced context engineering techniques.

#### **[MEM1: Learning to Synergize Memory and Reasoning for Efficient Long-Horizon Agents - Singapore-MIT June 2025](https://www.arxiv.org/pdf/2506.15841)**

1.  **MEM1 trains AI agents to keep only what matters—merging memory and reasoning at every step—so they never get overwhelmed, no matter how long the task.**

#### **[Eliciting Reasoning in Language Models with Cognitive Tools - IBM Zurich June 2025](https://www.arxiv.org/pdf/2506.12115)**

1.  **This research shows that breaking complex tasks into modular “cognitive tools” lets AI solve problems more thoughtfully—mirroring how expert humans reason step by step.**

#### **[Emergent Symbolic Mechanisms Support Abstract Reasoning in Large Language Models - ICML Princeton June 18, 2025](https://openreview.net/forum?id=y1SnRPDWx4)**

1.  **This paper proves that large language models develop their own inner symbolic “logic circuits”—enabling them to reason with abstract variables, not just surface word patterns.**

## Getting Started

1.  **Explore the Foundations:** Begin with the basics in `00_foundations/01_atoms_prompting.md` (5 min read).
2.  **Run a Minimal Example:** Experiment with the basic functionality using  `10_guides_zero_to_one/01_min_prompt.py` (Jupyter Notebook).
3.  **Use Templates:** Explore `20_templates/minimal_context.yaml` to jump-start your own projects.
4.  **Examine an Implementation:** Review a toy chatbot in `30_examples/00_toy_chatbot/` to see context management in action.

> I've been looking forward to this being conceptualized and formalized as there wasn't a prior established field. Prompt engineering receives quite the stigma and doesn't quite cover what most researchers and I do.
