> *"Context engineering is the delicate art and science of filling the context window with just the right information for the next step."* - **Andrej Karpathy**

## Key Features:

*   **Comprehensive Handbook:** A first-principles guide to context design, orchestration, and optimization.
*   **First Principles Approach:** A progressive learning path, built around a biological metaphor (atoms -> molecules -> cells -> ...).
*   **Practical Tutorials:** Hands-on guides (Jupyter Notebooks) to get you started.
*   **Reusable Templates:** Code snippets and templates to integrate into your projects.
*   **Real-World Examples:** Practical implementations across various use cases.
*   **Cutting-Edge Research:** Grounded in the latest findings from leading AI research.
*   **Community Driven:**  Leveraging a community of researchers and builders.

## Core Concepts

*   **Prompt Engineering vs. Context Engineering:** Understand the distinction between crafting prompts and managing the broader context.
*   **Token Optimization:** Learn strategies to optimize token usage for efficiency and cost.
*   **Few-Shot Learning:** Leverage examples for effective AI guidance.
*   **Memory Systems:** Implement systems that persist information across interactions.
*   **Retrieval Augmentation:** Integrate external knowledge sources to improve accuracy.
*   **Control Flow:** Break down complex tasks into manageable steps.
*   **Cognitive Tools & Prompt Programming**:  Learn to build custom tools and templates
*   **Neural Field Theory:** Use a dynamic neural field to update the context iteratively
