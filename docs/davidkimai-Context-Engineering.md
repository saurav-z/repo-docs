## What is Context Engineering?

Context Engineering goes beyond the simple prompt to encompass the entire information payload a language model processes at inference time. This includes:

*   **Prompts:**  The initial instruction.
*   **Examples & Memory:**  Guiding the model through examples and retaining information.
*   **Retrieval & Tools:**  Augmenting the model's knowledge and capabilities.
*   **State & Control Flow:**  Managing conversations and complex task execution.
