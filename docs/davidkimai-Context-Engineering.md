# Context Engineering: Unlock the Power Beyond Prompts 🚀

**Go beyond prompt engineering and master the art and science of context design, orchestration, and optimization with this comprehensive resource.** [Explore the original repository](https://github.com/davidkimai/Context-Engineering).

**Context Engineering** is the field dedicated to optimizing the *entire* information payload provided to a Language Model at inference time. This repo moves beyond simple prompt design. Learn how to architect the LLM's environment, including examples, memory, retrieval, tools, state, and control flow for dramatically improved performance.

## Key Features:

*   💡 **First-Principles Approach:** Dive deep into context engineering fundamentals.
*   📚 **Comprehensive Course:** Follow a structured learning path from foundational concepts to advanced techniques. (Course Under Construction)
*   💻 **Practical Examples:** Get hands-on with code and runnable cells.
*   📈 **Research-Driven:** Stay at the forefront with insights from cutting-edge research papers.
*   🛠️ **Modular Design:** Build with cognitive tools and prompt programming to extend context engineering capabilities.
*   🧠 **Visual Learning:** Benefit from clear diagrams, code, and visualizations to solidify your understanding.

## What You'll Learn:

*   **Token Budget Optimization:** Manage and optimize token usage for efficiency.
*   **Few-Shot Learning:** Implement effective teaching through demonstration.
*   **Memory Systems:** Create stateful, coherent interactions using persistent memory.
*   **Retrieval Augmentation (RAG):** Ground responses with external knowledge and facts.
*   **Control Flow:** Design complex task workflows using conditional logic.
*   **Context Pruning:** Refine content for optimal performance.
*   **Evaluation Metrics:** Measure and improve context effectiveness.
*   **Cognitive Tools & Prompt Programming:** Develop custom tools and templates.
*   **Neural Field Theory:** Model context as a dynamic neural field.
*   **Symbolic Mechanisms:** Utilize symbolic architectures for higher-order reasoning.
*   **Quantum Semantics:** Apply superpositional techniques for context design.

## Quick Start:

1.  **Foundations:** Begin with [`00_foundations/01_atoms_prompting.md`](00_foundations/01_atoms_prompting.md) (5 min).
2.  **Experiment:** Run [`10_guides_zero_to_hero/01_min_prompt.py`](10_guides_zero_to_hero/01_min_prompt.py).
3.  **Templates:** Review [`20_templates/minimal_context.yaml`](20_templates/minimal_context.yaml) for inspiration.
4.  **Examples:** Study the complete implementation in [`30_examples/00_toy_chatbot/`](30_examples/00_toy_chatbot/).
