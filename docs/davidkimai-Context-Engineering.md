# Context Engineering: Master the Art of Context Design for LLMs

**Go beyond prompt engineering and unlock the full potential of Large Language Models (LLMs) by mastering the art and science of *context design, orchestration, and optimization*.** 

Explore the [original repository](https://github.com/davidkimai/Context-Engineering) for a deep dive into context engineering.

## Key Features

*   **Comprehensive Course:** A structured, first-principles approach to context engineering.
*   **Hands-on Tutorials:** Practical guides with runnable code, from minimal prompts to advanced techniques.
*   **Reusable Templates:**  Ready-to-use components to accelerate your projects.
*   **Real-World Examples:** Practical implementations, including a toy chatbot, multi-agent orchestrator, and more.
*   **Deep-Dive Documentation:**  In-depth explanations of key concepts and techniques.
*   **Community Contributions:**  Open to contributions from developers to build knowledge together.

## Why Context Engineering?

While prompt engineering focuses on *what you say*, context engineering focuses on *everything else the model sees*. It provides a deeper understanding of how to shape and structure the information that accompanies your prompts to achieve the desired results.

## What You'll Learn:

*   **Token Budget Optimization:** Efficiently manage token usage for cost-effectiveness and speed.
*   **Few-Shot Learning:** Teach models through effective examples.
*   **Memory Systems:** Create coherent and stateful interactions.
*   **Retrieval Augmentation (RAG):** Ground responses in facts and reduce hallucinations.
*   **Control Flow:** Structure complex tasks into manageable steps.
*   **Context Pruning:** Maintain a focus on relevant information.
*   **Metrics & Evaluation:** Measure and improve context effectiveness.
*   **Cognitive Tools & Prompt Programming:** Build custom tools for reasoning.
*   **Neural Field Theory:** The basics of how context can be seen as a neural field and how to improve this system.
*   **Symbolic Mechanisms:** Understanding and utilizing symbolic architectures for advanced reasoning.
*   **Quantum Semantics:** Design systems using superpositional techniques.
