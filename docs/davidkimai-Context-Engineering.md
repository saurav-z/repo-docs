Context engineering is the strategic design and optimization of all information provided to an LLM at inference time, including prompts, examples, memory, and tools. This repository provides a comprehensive, first-principles approach to context engineering, offering a practical guide to transforming raw prompts into powerful AI applications.

## Key Features

*   **Foundations:** Build a strong understanding of context engineering principles, moving from simple prompts to complex systems.
*   **Hands-On Guides:**  Step-by-step tutorials and practical examples to apply the concepts directly.
*   **Reusable Templates:**  Leverage pre-built code snippets and design patterns for common context engineering tasks.
*   **Real-World Examples:** Explore practical implementations and use cases to inspire your projects.
*   **Research-Backed:** Explore the latest advancements in the field with links to cutting-edge research papers from ICML, NeurIPS, and more.

## Core Concepts

This repository adopts a progressive learning approach, breaking down context engineering into manageable levels.

*   **Atoms (Prompts):** Basic instruction units.
*   **Molecules (Examples):** Few-shot learning and demonstration sets.
*   **Cells (Memory):** Stateful conversation layers and context window management.
*   **Organs (Applications):** Multi-step control flows and system orchestration.
*   **Neural Systems (Reasoning):** Cognitive tools, reasoning frameworks, and verification.
*   **Neural Fields (Context):** Context as a dynamic neural field with iterative updating
