## About openpilot

[openpilot](https://github.com/commaai/openpilot) is an open-source driving assistance system that enhances the capabilities of supported vehicles. It's designed to provide advanced driver-assistance features using a combination of computer vision, sensor fusion, and machine learning.

## Key Features

*   **Advanced Driver Assistance:**  Offers features like lane keeping, adaptive cruise control, and automatic emergency braking (depending on the car's capabilities).
*   **Open Source & Community Driven:** Benefit from continuous improvements and contributions from a vibrant community of developers and users.
*   **Wide Vehicle Support:**  Compatible with a growing list of over 300+ car models.
*   **Easy Installation:** Simple setup using a comma 3/3X device and the `openpilot.comma.ai` URL.

## How to Get Started

To use openpilot, you'll need:

1.  **Supported Device:** A comma 3/3X, available at [comma.ai/shop](https://comma.ai/shop/comma-3x).
2.  **Software:** Install the release version using the URL `openpilot.comma.ai` on your comma 3/3X.
3.  **Supported Car:**  Ensure your vehicle is on [the supported cars list](docs/CARS.md).
4.  **Car Harness:**  A [car harness](https://comma.ai/shop/car-harness) to connect your device to your car.
