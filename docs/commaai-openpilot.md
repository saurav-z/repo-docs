| `release3`         | openpilot.comma.ai                      | This is openpilot's release branch.                                                 |
| `release3-staging` | openpilot-test.comma.ai                | This is the staging branch for releases. Use it to get new releases slightly early. |
| `nightly`          | openpilot-nightly.comma.ai             | This is the bleeding edge development branch. Do not expect this to be stable.      |
| `nightly-dev`      | installer.comma.ai/commaai/nightly-dev | Same as nightly, but includes experimental development features for some cars.      |
| `secretgoodopenpilot` | installer.comma.ai/commaai/secretgoodopenpilot | This is a preview branch from the autonomy team where new driving models get merged earlier than master. |
