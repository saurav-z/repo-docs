## Key Features

*   **Open Source:** Fully transparent and open for contributions and improvements.  [Learn more on GitHub](https://github.com/commaai/openpilot).
*   **Wide Vehicle Support:** Compatible with 300+ supported car models, constantly expanding.
*   **Easy Installation:** Installs on a comma 3/3X device with simple setup instructions.
*   **Active Community:** Thriving community for support, development, and collaboration.
*   **Continuous Updates:** Benefit from ongoing improvements and new features.
*   **Data-Driven:** Utilizes driving data to train and improve models.
*   **Safety Focused:** Built with safety guidelines, testing, and continuous improvements.

## Getting Started

To use openpilot, you'll need:

1.  **Supported Device:** A comma 3/3X, available at [comma.ai/shop](https://comma.ai/shop/comma-3x).
2.  **Software:** Install openpilot by entering the URL `openpilot.comma.ai` during the device setup.
3.  **Supported Car:** Ensure your car is on [the list of 275+ supported cars](docs/CARS.md).
4.  **Car Harness:** A [car harness](https://comma.ai/shop/car-harness) is required to connect your comma 3/3X to your car.

Detailed installation instructions are available at [comma.ai/setup](https://comma.ai/setup). Note that it's possible to run openpilot on [other hardware](https://blog.comma.ai/self-driving-car-for-free/), although it's not plug-and-play.
