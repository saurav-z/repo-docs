### Key Features of Hatchet

*   **üì• Queues:** Reliable task queues ensure your work gets done, even with application crashes, managing tasks efficiently and handling traffic spikes.
    *   Supports Python, Typescript, and Go. (with example code snippets)
    *   Ensures that you never drop a user request.
    *   Helps flatten large spikes in your application.
    *   Breaks down complex logic into smaller, reusable tasks.
    *   [Learn more](https://docs.hatchet.run/home/your-first-task)

*   **üéª Task Orchestration:** Build complex workflows using DAGs and durable tasks to chain multiple tasks.
    *   Supports Python, Typescript, and Go. (with example code snippets)
    *   **DAGs (directed acyclic graphs):** Pre-define the shape of your work.
    *   **Durable tasks:** These tasks are responsible for orchestrating other tasks.
    *   [Learn more](https://docs.hatchet.run/home/dags) and [Durable Execution](https://docs.hatchet.run/home/durable-execution)

*   **üö¶ Flow Control:** Control task execution with concurrency and rate limiting.
    *   Supports Python, Typescript, and Go. (with example code snippets)
    *   **Concurrency:** Limit tasks based on dynamic keys (e.g., user IDs).
    *   **Rate limiting:** Apply global and dynamic rate limits.
    *   [Learn more](https://docs.hatchet.run/home/concurrency) and [Rate Limits](https://docs.hatchet.run/home/rate-limits)

*   **üìÖ Scheduling:** Schedule tasks using cron, one-time scheduling, or duration-based pausing.
    *   Supports Python, Typescript, and Go. (with example code snippets)
    *   **Cron schedules:** Run tasks on a scheduled basis.
    *   **One-time tasks:** Schedule workflows for a specific future time.
    *   **Durable sleep:** Pause task execution for a specific duration.
    *   [Learn more](https://docs.hatchet.run/home/cron-runs), [Scheduled Runs](https://docs.hatchet.run/home/scheduled-runs) and [Durable Execution](https://docs.hatchet.run/home/durable-execution)

*   **üöè Task Routing:** Define task placement with sticky assignment or worker affinity.
    *   Supports Python, Typescript, and Go. (with example code snippets)
    *   **Sticky assignment:** Prefer or require tasks to run on the same worker.
    *   **Worker affinity:** Prioritize workers for optimal task handling.
    *   [Learn more](https://docs.hatchet.run/home/sticky-assignment) and [Worker Affinity](https://docs.hatchet.run/home/worker-affinity)

*   **‚ö°Ô∏è Event Triggers and Listeners:** Create event-driven architectures to start tasks and workflows based on triggers.
    *   Supports Python, Typescript, and Go. (with example code snippets)
    *   **Event listening:** Tasks can pause, waiting for events.
    *   **Event triggering:** Events launch workflows or workflow steps.
    *   [Learn more](https://docs.hatchet.run/home/durable-execution) and [Run on Event](https://docs.hatchet.run/home/run-on-event)

*   **üñ•Ô∏è Real-time Web UI:**
    *   Monitor tasks, workflows, and queues with real-time dashboards and metrics.
    *   Built-in alerting for quick issue detection.
    *   Logging from tasks to correlate failures with system logs.
