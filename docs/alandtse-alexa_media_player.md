# Alexa Media Player for Home Assistant

**Enhance your Home Assistant setup with seamless control of your Amazon Echo devices using the Alexa Media Player integration!**  **(See the original repository [here](https://github.com/alandtse/alexa_media_player))**

This custom component allows you to integrate and control your Amazon Echo devices directly within [Home Assistant](https://home-assistant.io), leveraging the unofficial Alexa API.  This mimics the functionality of the Alexa app, but please be aware that Amazon may change access at any time.

Inspired by the work of [Keaton Taylor](https://github.com/keatontaylor).
