**Key Features:**

*   **Experiment Tracking:** Effortlessly track metrics, hyperparameters, and more with a simple Python API, making it easy to monitor progress and compare results.
*   **Cloud and Local Support:** Use SwanLab in the cloud (like Weights & Biases) or locally for maximum flexibility.
*   **Rich Visualization:** Visualize your training data using interactive charts, including line plots, images, audio, text, videos, 3D point clouds, and ECharts custom charts, and even LLM generated content visualization.
*   **Hardware Monitoring:** Monitor CPU, GPU (Nvidia, Ascend, Intel, etc.), memory, and disk usage for deeper insights into resource utilization.
*   **Framework Integrations:** Seamlessly integrate with over 30 popular frameworks, including PyTorch, Hugging Face Transformers, PyTorch Lightning, LLaMA Factory, and many more.
*   **Experiment Management:**  Organize your experiments with a centralized dashboard for efficient project and experiment management.
*   **Result Comparison:** Easily compare hyperparameters and results across experiments using tables and charts to identify winning configurations.
*   **Collaboration:** Share experiments and collaborate with your team online, improving communication and training efficiency.
*   **Self-Hosting:**  Deploy SwanLab locally for offline use and complete control over your data.
*   **Plugin Ecosystem:** Extend SwanLab's functionality with plugins for email notifications, Slack integration, and custom data logging.
