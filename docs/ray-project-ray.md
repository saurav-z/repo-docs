*   **General Purpose:**  Capable of running any Python workload with performance in mind.
*   **AI Libraries:** A growing suite of libraries that includes:
    *   **Data:** Scalable Datasets for ML
    *   **Train:** Distributed Training
    *   **Tune:** Scalable Hyperparameter Tuning
    *   **RLlib:** Scalable Reinforcement Learning
    *   **Serve:** Scalable and Programmable Serving
*   **Ray Core:**  The foundation for distributed computing, with key abstractions like:
    *   **Tasks:** Stateless functions executed in the cluster.
    *   **Actors:** Stateful worker processes created in the cluster.
    *   **Objects:** Immutable values accessible across the cluster.
*   **Monitoring and Debugging:** Tools to monitor and debug your Ray applications.
    *   **Ray Dashboard:** Monitor Ray apps and clusters
    *   **Ray Distributed Debugger:** Debug Ray apps
*   **Ecosystem Integrations:**  A growing `ecosystem of community integrations`.
*   **Flexible Deployment:** Runs on any machine, cluster, cloud provider, and Kubernetes.

### Installation

Install Ray using pip:

```bash
pip install ray
```

For nightly builds, see the [Installation page](https://docs.ray.io/en/latest/ray-overview/installation.html).

### Why Ray?

Today's ML workloads are increasingly compute-intensive. Ray offers a unified way to scale Python and AI applications from a laptop to a cluster. With Ray, you can seamlessly scale the same code from a laptop to a cluster. Ray is designed to be general-purpose, meaning that it can performantly run any kind of workload. If your application is written in Python, you can scale it with Ray, no other infrastructure required.
