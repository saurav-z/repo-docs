Ray is a powerful, open-source framework designed to simplify the process of scaling AI and Python applications. It provides a unified platform for distributed computing, making it easy to develop and deploy applications that can handle large datasets and complex computations.

Key Features:

*   **Unified Framework:** Scale your applications from a single machine to a cluster without code changes.
*   **General-Purpose:** Ray can run any Python workload, providing flexibility for diverse use cases.
*   **AI-Focused Libraries:** Leverage specialized libraries for:
    *   **Data:** Scalable Datasets for ML
    *   **Train:** Distributed Training
    *   **Tune:** Scalable Hyperparameter Tuning
    *   **RLlib:** Scalable Reinforcement Learning
    *   **Serve:** Scalable and Programmable Serving
*   **Core Abstractions:**  Utilize key building blocks for distributed computing:
    *   Tasks: Stateless functions executed in the cluster.
    *   Actors: Stateful worker processes created in the cluster.
    *   Objects: Immutable values accessible across the cluster.
*   **Easy to Use:** Install Ray with a simple `pip install ray`.
*   **Comprehensive Monitoring and Debugging:** Utilize the Ray Dashboard and Distributed Debugger for insights into your application.
*   **Flexible Deployment:** Run Ray on any machine, cluster, cloud provider, and Kubernetes.
*   **Growing Ecosystem:** Benefit from a rich ecosystem of community integrations.

## Why Choose Ray?

Single-node development environments are often insufficient for today's compute-intensive ML workloads. Ray bridges this gap, enabling you to seamlessly scale your Python applications from local development to production clusters. Designed for general-purpose use, Ray efficiently handles any workload, minimizing infrastructure requirements and maximizing developer productivity.
