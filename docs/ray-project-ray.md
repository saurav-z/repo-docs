## Key Features

*   **Unified Framework:** Scales applications from a single machine to large clusters without code changes.
*   **General-Purpose:** Can efficiently run any Python workload.
*   **AI Libraries:** Streamlines ML compute with specialized libraries:
    *   Data: Scalable Datasets for ML
    *   Train: Distributed Training
    *   Tune: Scalable Hyperparameter Tuning
    *   RLlib: Scalable Reinforcement Learning
    *   Serve: Scalable and Programmable Serving
*   **Ray Core Abstractions:** Provides building blocks for distributed computing:
    *   Tasks: Stateless functions executed in the cluster.
    *   Actors: Stateful worker processes created in the cluster.
    *   Objects: Immutable values accessible across the cluster.
*   **Monitoring and Debugging:**
    *   Ray Dashboard: Monitor Ray applications and clusters.
    *   Ray Distributed Debugger: Debug Ray applications.
*   **Flexible Deployment:** Runs on any machine, cluster, cloud provider, and Kubernetes.
*   **Extensive Ecosystem:** Features a growing `ecosystem of community integrations <https://docs.ray.io/en/latest/ray-overview/ray-libraries.html>`_.

## Installation

Install Ray with: `pip install ray`

For nightly builds, see the `Installation page <https://docs.ray.io/en/latest/ray-overview/installation.html>`__.

## Why Choose Ray?

Single-node environments are insufficient for modern, compute-intensive ML workloads. Ray overcomes this limitation by providing a seamless way to scale Python and AI applications from your laptop to a cluster.  Ray is designed to be general-purpose, meaning that it can performantly run any kind of workload. If your application is written in Python, you can scale it with Ray, no other infrastructure required.
