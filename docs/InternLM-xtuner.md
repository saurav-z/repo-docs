## What's New

*   **\[2025/09]**: XTuner V1 Released! A Next-Generation Training Engine Built for Ultra-Large MoE Models

## Roadmap

XTuner V1 is continuously improving training efficiency for pre-training, instruction fine-tuning, and reinforcement learning of ultra-large MoE models, with special focus on Ascend NPU optimization.

### Training Engine

Our vision is to establish XTuner V1 as a versatile training backend that seamlessly integrates with the broader open-source ecosystem.
