## XTuner: Unleash the Power of Efficient LLM Training

XTuner is a next-generation training engine designed for fine-tuning and training ultra-large language models (LLMs), especially Mixture of Experts (MoE) models, offering superior efficiency and scalability. [Learn more about XTuner on GitHub](https://github.com/InternLM/xtuner).

## Key Features

*   **Dropless Training:** Train massive MoE models (up to 600B parameters) with optimized parallelism, eliminating the need for complex expert parallelism.
    *   Scalable without complexity: Train 200B-scale MoE models without expert parallelism; 600B models require only intra-node expert parallelism
    *   Optimized parallelism strategy: Smaller expert parallelism dimension compared to traditional 3D approaches, enabling more efficient Dropless training
*   **Long Sequence Support:** Train 200B MoE models on 64k sequence lengths without sequence parallelism.
    *   Memory-efficient design: Train 200B MoE models on 64k sequence lengths without sequence parallelism through advanced memory optimization techniques
    *   Flexible scaling: Full support for DeepSpeed Ulysses sequence parallelism with linearly scalable maximum sequence length
    *   Robust performance: Maintains stability despite expert load imbalance during long sequence training
*   **Superior Efficiency:** Experience groundbreaking performance and hardware optimization.
    *   Supports MoE training up to 1T parameters
    *   Breakthrough performance: First to achieve FSDP training throughput that surpasses traditional 3D parallel schemes for MoE models above 200B scale
    *   Hardware optimization: Achieves training efficiency on Ascend A3 Supernode that exceeds NVIDIA H800
