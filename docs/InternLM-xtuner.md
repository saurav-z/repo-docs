# XTuner: The Next-Generation LLM Training Engine for Ultra-Large Models

XTuner is a powerful and efficient toolkit designed for fine-tuning large language models (LLMs), enabling researchers and developers to train cutting-edge models at scale.  [Visit the original repository](https://github.com/InternLM/xtuner) to learn more.

## Key Features

*   **Dropless Training:** Train massive MoE models without the complexities of traditional 3D parallelism.
    *   Scalable up to 200B-scale MoE models without expert parallelism; 600B models require only intra-node expert parallelism.
    *   Optimized parallelism strategy reduces expert parallelism dimension for efficient training.
*   **Long Sequence Support:**  Train on extended sequences with memory efficiency.
    *   Train 200B MoE models on 64k sequence lengths without sequence parallelism.
    *   Full support for DeepSpeed Ulysses sequence parallelism.
    *   Maintains stability even with expert load imbalances.
*   **Superior Efficiency:** Achieve breakthrough performance in training.
    *   Supports MoE training up to 1T parameters.
    *   Achieves FSDP training throughput exceeding traditional 3D parallel schemes for MoE models above 200B scale.
    *   Optimized for Ascend A3 Supernode hardware.

## News

*   **\[2025/09]** XTuner V1 Released! A Next-Generation Training Engine Built for Ultra-Large MoE Models

## XTuner V1: Deep Dive

XTuner V1 is a cutting-edge training engine specifically designed for training ultra-large-scale Mixture of Experts (MoE) models. It departs from traditional 3D parallel training architectures, focusing on optimization for the current MoE training landscape.

### Training Engine Roadmap

XTuner V1 is focused on continuously improving training efficiency for pre-training, instruction fine-tuning, and reinforcement learning of ultra-large MoE models, particularly focusing on Ascend NPU optimization.
