## XTuner: Unleash the Power of Ultra-Large MoE Models with Unrivaled Training Efficiency

XTuner is a next-generation LLM training engine designed for efficient training of ultra-large Mixture of Experts (MoE) models. Find the original repository [here](https://github.com/InternLM/xtuner).

## Key Features

*   **Dropless Training:**
    *   Train massive MoE models (up to 200B parameters) without expert parallelism, and 600B models with only intra-node expert parallelism.
    *   Optimized parallelism strategy for efficient "Dropless" training.
*   **Long Sequence Support:**
    *   Train 200B MoE models on sequence lengths up to 64k without sequence parallelism using advanced memory optimization.
    *   Full support for DeepSpeed Ulysses sequence parallelism for linearly scalable sequence lengths.
    *   Maintains stability even with expert load imbalance during long sequence training.
*   **Superior Efficiency:**
    *   Supports MoE training up to 1 Trillion parameters.
    *   Achieves FSDP training throughput surpassing traditional 3D parallel schemes for MoE models above 200B scale.
    *   Optimized for Ascend A3 Supernode hardware, achieving exceptional training efficiency.
