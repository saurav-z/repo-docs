# XTuner: The Next-Generation LLM Training Engine for Ultra-Large MoE Models

XTuner is a powerful toolkit designed for efficient fine-tuning of Large Language Models (LLMs), enabling cutting-edge research and development in the field.  [Explore the XTuner repository on GitHub](https://github.com/InternLM/xtuner).

## Key Features

*   **Dropless Training:**

    *   Train massive MoE models (200B+ parameters) without the complexity of expert parallelism; 600B models require only intra-node expert parallelism.
    *   Optimized parallelism strategy for efficient Dropless training with smaller expert parallelism dimensions.

*   **Long Sequence Support:**

    *   Train 200B MoE models on 64k sequence lengths without sequence parallelism using advanced memory optimization.
    *   Full support for DeepSpeed Ulysses sequence parallelism for linearly scalable maximum sequence length.
    *   Maintains stability even with expert load imbalance during long sequence training.

*   **Superior Efficiency:**

    *   Supports MoE training up to 1T parameters.
    *   Achieves industry-leading FSDP training throughput, surpassing traditional 3D parallel schemes for MoE models above 200B scale.
    *   Optimized for Ascend A3 Supernode hardware, delivering exceptional training efficiency.

## Roadmap

XTuner V1 is continuously evolving to improve training efficiency for pre-training, instruction fine-tuning, and reinforcement learning of ultra-large MoE models, with a special focus on Ascend NPU optimization.

### Training Engine

XTuner V1 aims to become a versatile training backend, seamlessly integrating with the open-source ecosystem.
