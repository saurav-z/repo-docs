# XTuner: Fine-tune Large Language Models with Unprecedented Efficiency

XTuner is a cutting-edge, next-generation LLM training engine designed for fine-tuning and optimizing large language models, offering state-of-the-art performance and scalability.  [Explore the XTuner repository](https://github.com/InternLM/xtuner).

## Key Features

*   **Dropless Training:**
    *   Train massive MoE models (200B-scale and beyond) without the complexity of traditional 3D parallelism.
    *   Efficient expert parallelism for handling models up to 600B parameters.
    *   Optimized parallelism strategy for improved Dropless training efficiency.
*   **Long Sequence Support:**
    *   Train 200B MoE models on sequence lengths up to 64k without sequence parallelism, leveraging advanced memory optimization.
    *   Full support for DeepSpeed Ulysses sequence parallelism for linearly scalable maximum sequence lengths.
    *   Maintains stability even with expert load imbalance during long sequence training.
*   **Superior Efficiency:**
    *   Supports MoE training up to 1T parameters.
    *   Achieves FSDP training throughput exceeding traditional 3D parallel schemes for MoE models above 200B scale.
    *   Hardware optimization achieving training efficiency on Ascend A3 Supernode that exceeds NVIDIA H800.
*   **Multimodal Support**:
    *   Full support for vision-language model training
    *   Optimized for instruction following	
*   **Advanced Algorithm Integration**:
    *   GRPO, MPO, DAPO, and Multi-turn Agentic RL all supported.
