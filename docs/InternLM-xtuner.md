## XTuner: Your Toolkit for Efficient LLM Fine-tuning

XTuner is a cutting-edge training engine designed for efficient fine-tuning of large language models (LLMs), particularly for ultra-large-scale Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) models. [Explore the XTuner repository](https://github.com/InternLM/xtuner).

### Key Features

*   **Dropless Training:** Train massive MoE models (200B+ parameters) with remarkable efficiency, eliminating the need for expert parallelism in many cases.
    *   Scalable training without added complexity.
    *   Optimized parallelism strategy for efficient Dropless training.
*   **Long Sequence Support:** Train on exceptionally long sequences (up to 64k tokens for 200B MoE models) without sequence parallelism.
    *   Memory-efficient design for handling long sequences.
    *   Supports DeepSpeed Ulysses sequence parallelism for scalable lengths.
    *   Maintains stability even with expert load imbalances during training.
*   **Superior Efficiency:** Achieve unparalleled training performance.
    *   Supports MoE training up to 1 Trillion parameters.
    *   Achieves state-of-the-art training throughput for MoE models over 200B.
    *   Optimized for Ascend NPU hardware, surpassing traditional 3D parallel schemes.
