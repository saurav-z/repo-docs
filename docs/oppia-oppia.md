# Oppia: Interactive Learning for Everyone

**Oppia is a free, open-source platform empowering anyone to create and share engaging, interactive learning experiences.** ([See the original repository](https://github.com/oppia/oppia))

*   **Personalized Learning:** Get feedback as you learn, just like a tutor.
*   **Free Educational Resources:** Access free lessons on basic math, with plans to expand to science and financial literacy.
