Oppia transforms education by providing a user-friendly tool for building and sharing interactive learning activities, known as "explorations." These explorations simulate one-on-one tutoring, allowing learners to actively participate and receive immediate feedback.

**Key Features:**

*   **Interactive Learning:** Creates engaging explorations that simulate a tutor's guidance.
*   **Open-Source:** Benefit from a community-driven platform that's free and accessible.
*   **Accessibility:** Provides educational resources, including lessons on mathematics, for learners with limited access to resources.
*   **Versatile:**  Suitable for educators, content creators, and anyone wanting to share knowledge.
*   **Expanding Content:** Actively developing lessons in mathematics, science, and financial literacy.
