Strands Agents is a powerful Python SDK designed to simplify the creation and deployment of AI agents, providing a model-driven approach for both simple and complex applications. Scale your agents from local development to production with ease.

## Key Features

*   **Model Agnostic:** Supports a wide range of model providers including Amazon Bedrock, Anthropic, LiteLLM, Llama, Ollama, OpenAI, and custom providers.
*   **Lightweight & Flexible:** Provides a simple and customizable agent loop for efficient agent development.
*   **Advanced Capabilities:** Enables multi-agent systems, autonomous agents, and streaming support.
*   **Built-in MCP Support:** Integrates seamlessly with Model Context Protocol (MCP) servers, offering access to a vast library of pre-built tools.
*   **Python-Based Tools:** Easily create custom tools using Python decorators.

## Getting Started

### Installation

Ensure you have Python 3.10+ installed, then:

```bash
# Create and activate virtual environment
python -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate  # On Windows use: .venv\Scripts\activate

# Install Strands and tools
pip install strands-agents strands-agents-tools
```

### Quick Example

```python
from strands import Agent
from strands_tools import calculator
agent = Agent(tools=[calculator])
agent("What is the square root of 1764")
```

**Important:** For the default Amazon Bedrock model provider, you'll need AWS credentials configured and model access enabled for Claude 3.7 Sonnet in the us-west-2 region. See the [Quickstart Guide](https://strandsagents.com/) for details on configuring other model providers.

## Feature Deep Dive

### Python-Based Tools

Effortlessly build tools using Python decorators:

```python
from strands import Agent, tool

@tool
def word_count(text: str) -> int:
    """Count words in text.

    This docstring is used by the LLM to understand the tool's purpose.
    """
    return len(text.split())

agent = Agent(tools=[word_count])
response = agent("How many words are in this sentence?")
```

### MCP Support

Seamlessly integrate with Model Context Protocol (MCP) servers:

```python
from strands import Agent
from strands.tools.mcp import MCPClient
from mcp import stdio_client, StdioServerParameters

aws_docs_client = MCPClient(
    lambda: stdio_client(StdioServerParameters(command="uvx", args=["awslabs.aws-documentation-mcp-server@latest"]))
)

with aws_docs_client:
   agent = Agent(tools=aws_docs_client.list_tools_sync())
   response = agent("Tell me about Amazon Bedrock and how to use it with Python")
```

### Multiple Model Providers

Supports various model providers:

```python
from strands import Agent
from strands.models import BedrockModel
from strands.models.ollama import OllamaModel
from strands.models.llamaapi import LlamaAPIModel

# Bedrock
bedrock_model = BedrockModel(
  model_id="us.amazon.nova-pro-v1:0",
  temperature=0.3,
  streaming=True, # Enable/disable streaming
)
agent = Agent(model=bedrock_model)
agent("Tell me about Agentic AI")

# Ollama
ollama_model = OllamaModel(
  host="http://localhost:11434",
  model_id="llama3"
)
agent = Agent(model=ollama_model)
agent("Tell me about Agentic AI")

# Llama API
llama_model = LlamaAPIModel(
    model_id="Llama-4-Maverick-17B-128E-Instruct-FP8",
)
agent = Agent(model=llama_model)
response = agent("Tell me about Agentic AI")
```

Built-in providers:

*   [Amazon Bedrock](https://strandsagents.com/latest/user-guide/concepts/model-providers/amazon-bedrock/)
*   [Anthropic](https://strandsagents.com/latest/user-guide/concepts/model-providers/anthropic/)
*   [LiteLLM](https://strandsagents.com/latest/user-guide/concepts/model-providers/litellm/)
*   [LlamaAPI](https://strandsagents.com/latest/user-guide/concepts/model-providers/llamaapi/)
*   [Ollama](https://strandsagents.com/latest/user-guide/concepts/model-providers/ollama/)
*   [OpenAI](https://strandsagents.com/latest/user-guide/concepts/model-providers/openai/)

Custom providers can be implemented using [Custom Providers](https://strandsagents.com/latest/user-guide/concepts/model-providers/custom_model_provider/)

### Example Tools

Strands offers a `strands-agents-tools` package with pre-built tools:

```python
from strands import Agent
from strands_tools import calculator
agent = Agent(tools=[calculator])
agent("What is the square root of 1764")
```

It's also available on GitHub via [strands-agents/tools](https://github.com/strands-agents/tools).
