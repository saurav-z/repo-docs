ExecuTorch is a powerful, open-source framework designed to bring cutting-edge AI experiences directly to your devices, enabling on-device inference and training for a wide range of applications. **[Explore the ExecuTorch repository on GitHub](https://github.com/pytorch/executorch)**.

## Key Features of ExecuTorch

ExecuTorch offers a comprehensive suite of features to facilitate efficient and performant on-device AI deployment:

*   **Broad Model Support:** Supports a wide array of model types, including LLMs (Large Language Models), CV (Computer Vision), ASR (Automatic Speech Recognition), and TTS (Text to Speech).
*   **Cross-Platform Compatibility:** Seamlessly runs on various operating systems, including iOS, macOS (ARM64), Android, Linux, and microcontrollers.
*   **Hardware Acceleration:** Leverages hardware acceleration from leading vendors such as Apple, Arm, Cadence, MediaTek, OpenVINO, Qualcomm, Vulkan, and XNNPACK for optimized performance.
*   **Portability:** Allows developers to target diverse hardware, from high-end smartphones to embedded systems.
*   **Productivity:** Simplifies the development workflow by allowing developers to leverage the same toolchains and developer tools used in PyTorch for model authoring, conversion, debugging, and deployment.
*   **Performance:** Provides a lightweight runtime that maximizes the use of CPUs, NPUs, and DSPs to deliver a smooth and high-performance user experience.
