ExecuTorch is a powerful, open-source framework from PyTorch designed to efficiently run and train AI models directly on a wide range of devices. **Want to bring the power of AI to your edge devices? ExecuTorch is your solution.** This enables fast, optimized on-device AI experiences across various applications and platforms, including those from Meta (Facebook, Instagram, Meta Quest, Ray-Ban Meta Smart Glasses, and WhatsApp).

## Key Features of ExecuTorch:

*   **Broad Model Support:** Compatible with a wide variety of model types, including:
    *   Large Language Models (LLMs)
    *   Computer Vision (CV) models
    *   Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) models
    *   Text-to-Speech (TTS) models
*   **Cross-Platform Compatibility:**  Works across diverse operating systems and hardware, ensuring maximum reach for your AI models.
    *   **Operating Systems:** iOS, macOS (ARM64), Android, Linux, Microcontrollers
    *   **Hardware Acceleration:** Apple, Arm, Cadence, MediaTek, OpenVINO, Qualcomm, Vulkan, XNNPACK
*   **Portability:**  Runs seamlessly from high-end mobile phones to highly constrained embedded systems.
*   **Developer Productivity:** Utilizes familiar PyTorch toolchains for model authoring, conversion, debugging, and deployment.
*   **High Performance:**  Delivers a smooth user experience through a lightweight runtime that maximizes hardware capabilities (CPUs, NPUs, DSPs).
