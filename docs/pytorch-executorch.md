ExecuTorch is a powerful, open-source framework for deploying and running PyTorch models directly on a wide variety of devices, revolutionizing on-device AI experiences.

## Key Features and Benefits

ExecuTorch offers a comprehensive solution for deploying and optimizing AI models on a range of devices:

*   **Broad Platform Support:** Run your models on iOS, macOS (ARM64), Android, Linux, and even microcontrollers.
*   **Hardware Acceleration:** Leverage the power of various hardware accelerators, including Apple, Arm, Cadence, MediaTek, OpenVINO, Qualcomm, Vulkan, and XNNPACK for optimal performance.
*   **Portability:** Deploy your models across diverse platforms, from high-end smartphones to resource-constrained embedded systems.
*   **Productivity:** Streamline your workflow with a unified toolchain, facilitating model authoring, conversion, debugging, and deployment using the same tools as PyTorch.
*   **Performance:** Deliver exceptional end-user experiences with a lightweight runtime that maximizes hardware capabilities like CPUs, NPUs, and DSPs.
*   **LLM and Model Support:** Supports a wide range of models, including Large Language Models (LLMs), Computer Vision (CV), Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR), and Text-to-Speech (TTS) models.
