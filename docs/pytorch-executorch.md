**ExecuTorch** is a cutting-edge, open-source framework from PyTorch, designed to bring high-performance AI to your devices.  It's the engine behind many of Meta's on-device AI experiences, including those on Facebook, Instagram, Meta Quest, Ray-Ban Meta Smart Glasses, and WhatsApp.  Explore the original repository on [GitHub](https://github.com/pytorch/executorch).

## Key Features

ExecuTorch empowers developers to build and deploy AI models across a wide range of platforms with:

*   **Broad Model Support:** Compatibility with a variety of models, including LLMs (Large Language Models), CV (Computer Vision), ASR (Automatic Speech Recognition), and TTS (Text-to-Speech).
*   **Extensive Platform Compatibility:**
    *   **Operating Systems:** iOS, macOS (ARM64), Android, Linux, and Microcontrollers.
    *   **Hardware Acceleration:** Apple, Arm, Cadence, MediaTek, OpenVINO, Qualcomm, Vulkan, and XNNPACK.
*   **Portability:**  Runs seamlessly across diverse hardware, from high-end mobile devices to resource-constrained embedded systems.
*   **Productivity:** Enables developers to use familiar PyTorch toolchains for model authoring, conversion, debugging, and deployment.
*   **Performance:** Offers a lightweight runtime that fully leverages hardware capabilities (CPUs, NPUs, DSPs) for a smooth user experience.
