ExecuTorch is a powerful, open-source framework from PyTorch, enabling developers to deploy and run AI models directly on a wide range of devices. **Designed for both inference and training, ExecuTorch delivers high performance and portability across diverse hardware, from mobile phones to embedded systems.** Explore the original repository on [GitHub](https://github.com/pytorch/executorch).

## Key Features of ExecuTorch:

*   **Broad Platform Support:**  Runs on iOS, macOS (ARM64), Android, Linux, and microcontrollers.
*   **Extensive Hardware Acceleration:** Optimized for Apple, Arm, Cadence, MediaTek, OpenVINO, Qualcomm, Vulkan, and XNNPACK.
*   **Model Compatibility:** Supports a wide variety of models including LLMs (Large Language Models), CV (Computer Vision), ASR (Automatic Speech Recognition), and TTS (Text to Speech).
*   **Portability:**  Deploy models across a vast range of devices, from high-end mobile phones to resource-constrained embedded systems.
*   **Productivity:** Leverages familiar PyTorch toolchains for model authoring, conversion, debugging, and deployment.
*   **Performance:** Provides a lightweight runtime, maximizing hardware capabilities (CPUs, NPUs, DSPs) for a seamless user experience.
