## Installation

### Prerequisites:

*   Working knowledge of Django and a Django project.
*   See [Django Installation Guide](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/4.2/intro/tutorial01/#creating-a-project)

The easiest way to start is to use the zero-config Django Ledger starter template: [django-ledger-starter](https://github.com/arrobalytics/django-ledger-starter).
Alternatively, you may create your project from scratch.

### Integrating into an Existing Project:

1.  **Add to `INSTALLED_APPS`:**

```python
INSTALLED_APPS = [
    ...,
    'django_ledger',
    ...,
]
```

2.  **Add Context Preprocessor (in `settings.py`):**

```python
TEMPLATES = [
    {
        'OPTIONS': {
            'context_processors': [
                '...',
                'django_ledger.context.django_ledger_context'
            ],
        },
    },
]
```

3.  **Run Migrations:**

```shell
python manage.py migrate
```

4.  **Add URLs (in your project's `urls.py`):**

```python
from django.urls import include, path

urlpatterns = [
    ...,
    path('ledger/', include('django_ledger.urls', namespace='django_ledger')),
    ...,
]
```

5.  **Run the Project:**

```shell
python manage.py runserver
```

*   Access the Django Ledger root view (usually at `http://127.0.0.1:8000/ledger`).
*   Use superuser credentials to log in.

## Deprecated Behavior Setting (v0.8.0+)

The `DJANGO_LEDGER_USE_DEPRECATED_BEHAVIOR` setting controls access to deprecated features.

*   Default: `False` (deprecated features disabled)
*   Set to `True` in your Django settings to temporarily enable deprecated features.

## Development Setup

**Prerequisites:** Python and Django installed.  Recommended to use a virtual environment.

6.  Create a superuser:

```shell
python manage.py createsuperuser
```

7.  Run the development server:

```shell
python manage.py runserver
```

## Docker Development Setup

1.  Navigate to your project directory.

2.  Give executable permissions to `entrypoint.sh`

```shell
sudo chmod +x entrypoint.sh
```

3.  Add host '0.0.0.0' into `ALLOWED_HOSTS` in `settings.py`.

4.  Build and run the Docker container:
