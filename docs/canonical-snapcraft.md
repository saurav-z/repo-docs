# Snapcraft: Package and Distribute Your Software with Ease

**Snapcraft** is the command-line tool that simplifies software packaging and distribution across all major Linux distributions and IoT devices, allowing developers to create universal, self-contained packages called "snaps."  Get started with [Snapcraft on GitHub](https://github.com/canonical/snapcraft).

## Key Features

*   **Universal Packaging:** Package your app, program, toolkit, or library once and deploy it across various Linux distributions.
*   **Dependency Management:** Bundles all required libraries within the snap, solving dependency issues.
*   **Simple Configuration:** Uses a `snapcraft.yaml` file for easy project setup and management.
*   **Cross-Platform Support:**  Available on Linux, Windows, and macOS.
*   **App Store Integration:** Seamlessly register and upload your snaps to public and private app stores, including the Snap Store.
*   **Version Control & Parallel Releases:** Supports snap versioning and parallel releases for easy updates and rollbacks.

## Getting Started

### Initialize a Snap Project

Create a basic `snapcraft.yaml` file in your project directory:

```bash
snapcraft init
```

### Build Your Snap

Package your project into a snap:

```bash
snapcraft pack
```

### Upload Your Snap

Publish your snap to the Snap Store:

```bash
snapcraft upload
```
