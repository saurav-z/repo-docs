# Xonsh: The Python-Powered Shell

*   **Cross-Platform:** Works on Linux, macOS, and Windows, providing a consistent shell experience across different operating systems.
*   **Extensible:** Supports a plugin system (`xontribs`) to customize and extend functionality.
*   **Interactive and Scriptable:** Use Xonsh interactively for everyday tasks or write scripts for more complex automation.

## Key Advantages

*   **Shell Commands in Python:** Run shell commands directly within Python code.
*   **Python Code in Shell:**  Use Python code directly within the shell environment.
*   **Familiar Shell Syntax:** Use existing shell commands and learn the basics easily.
