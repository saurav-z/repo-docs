# WilmerAI: Expertly Routing Your LLM Inference üöÄ

**Unleash the power of sophisticated, multi-LLM workflows to revolutionize how you interact with and orchestrate your language models. Enhance your AI experience by leveraging a single interface to manage multiple LLMs, crafting custom workflows, and optimizing performance.**

## Key Features üîë

*   **Prompt Routing:** Direct prompts to custom categories (coding, math, personas, etc.) via user-defined workflows.
*   **Custom Workflows:** Design tailored workflows for each task.
*   **Multi-LLM Orchestration:** Combine the strengths of multiple LLMs in a single prompt for enhanced results.
*   **Offline Wikipedia API Integration:** Leverage the [OfflineWikipediaTextApi](https://github.com/SomeOddCodeGuy/OfflineWikipediaTextApi) for RAG-enhanced factual responses.
*   **Continuous Chat Summaries:** Generate up-to-date summaries to maintain context in extended conversations.
*   **Model Hotswapping:** Maximize VRAM utilization with Ollama's model-swapping feature.
*   **Customizable Presets:** Easily configure LLM parameters via JSON files.
*   **Vision Support via Ollama:** Process images with the power of Ollama's multi-modal abilities.
*   **Mid-Workflow Control:** Implement workflow branching with Conditional Custom Workflow Nodes.
*   **MCP Server Tool Integration using MCPO:** New and experimental support for tool usage mid-workflow. Big thank you to [iSevenDays](https://github.com/iSevenDays) for the amazing work on this feature. More info can be found in the [ReadMe](Public/modules/README_MCP_TOOLS.md)

## Core Concepts & Architecture üõ†Ô∏è

WilmerAI serves as an intelligent intermediary between your front-end application (e.g., SillyTavern, Open WebUI) and the various LLM APIs you're using. It exposes both OpenAI and Ollama compatible API endpoints for seamless integration, and on the backend, it is capable of communicating with services like OpenAI, KoboldCpp, and Ollama to route prompts to LLMs.

*   **Front-End Integration:** Your front end connects to WilmerAI via standard API endpoints.
*   **Workflow Execution:** Prompts pass through a series of user-defined workflows, potentially involving multiple LLMs and/or tools.
*   **Response Delivery:** WilmerAI processes the responses and delivers the final result back to your application.

### Visualizing the Workflow

[Insert a visual, like the "No-RAG vs RAG" GIF]

*   **Enhanced Performance:** Iterative LLM calls and workflows are key to improving the quality of answers.
*   **Distributed LLMs:** Exploit multiple machines and proprietary APIs for the best results.

## Setup & Configuration ‚öôÔ∏è

### Quick Start

1.  **Installation:** Follow the steps in the `Quick-ish Setup` section.
2.  **Configuration:** Use the pre-made user configurations in `Public/Configs/Users` and configure Endpoints in `Public/Configs/Endpoints`.
3.  **Routing:** Use the routing config files in `Public/Configs/Routing` or create new ones.
4.  **Set the User:** Choose your current user in `Public/Configs/Users/_current-user.json` or using the `--User` argument.

### Detailed Steps
