# WilmerAI: Unleash the Power of Context-Aware Workflows for Advanced LLM Orchestration

**WilmerAI is a powerful application that goes beyond simple prompt routing, enabling you to build intelligent, multi-step workflows that orchestrate Large Language Models (LLMs) for complex tasks.** ðŸ”— [View the original repository](https://github.com/SomeOddCodeGuy/WilmerAI)

## Key Features:

*   **Advanced Contextual Routing:** Understands conversation history to direct requests to the most appropriate specialized workflow, using prompt routing and in-workflow conditional logic.
*   **Node-Based Workflow Engine:** Processes requests through JSON-defined workflows, enabling complex, chained-thought processes.
*   **Multi-LLM & Multi-Tool Orchestration:** Connect each node in a workflow to different LLM endpoints or external tools for optimized task execution.
*   **Modular & Reusable Workflows:** Build self-contained workflows for common tasks and reuse them within larger workflows.
*   **Stateful Conversation Memory:** Provides context for long conversations with a summary file, rolling summary, and a vector database for Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG).
*   **Adaptable API Gateway:** Exposes OpenAI and Ollama-compatible API endpoints, compatible with your existing front-ends.
*   **Flexible Backend Connectors:** Supports connections to various LLM backends, including OpenAI, Ollama, and KoboldCpp, through a simple configuration of Endpoints, API Types, and Presets.
*   **MCP Server Tool Integration:** Uses MCPO for experimental support in mid-workflow tool usage.

## The Power of Workflows:

WilmerAI leverages the power of workflows to unlock unprecedented control and flexibility in your LLM interactions.

*   **Semi-Autonomous Workflows:** Determine which tools to use and when, orchestrating multiple LLMs.

*   **Iterative LLM Calls:** Improve performance by automatically asking follow-up questions.
*   **Distributed LLMs:** Utilize multiple machines and LLM APIs to make your workflows more powerful.
