# WilmerAI: Revolutionizing Conversational AI with Context-Aware Workflows

**Unlock advanced AI capabilities with WilmerAI, a powerful application that orchestrates complex tasks and intelligent prompt routing using node-based workflows.** ([Original Repository](https://github.com/SomeOddCodeGuy/WilmerAI))

## Key Features

*   **Advanced Contextual Routing**: Understands the full context of a conversation using a node-based system.

    *   **Prompt Routing**: Selects the best workflow based on the initial prompt.
    *   **In-Workflow Routing**: Dynamically chooses the next step based on previous node outputs.
    *   **Full Conversation History Analysis:** Analyzes the entire conversation, going beyond single messages.
*   **Core: Node-Based Workflow Engine**: Executes requests through JSON-defined workflows, enabling complex chained processes.
*   **Multi-LLM & Multi-Tool Orchestration**:  Each node can connect to a different LLM endpoint or tool.
*   **Modular & Reusable Workflows**:  Build and reuse self-contained workflows for common tasks.
*   **Stateful Conversation Memory**: Maintains context with a chronological summary, rolling summary, and vector database.
*   **Adaptable API Gateway**: Compatible with OpenAI and Ollama APIs.
*   **Flexible Backend Connectors**: Connects to OpenAI, Ollama, and KoboldCpp backends.
*   **MCP Server Tool Integration**:  Integrates with MCP server tools for enhanced functionality.

##  Why Choose WilmerAI?

WilmerAI goes beyond simple routing, offering user-controlled, semi-autonomous workflows. This enables:

*   **Enhanced Categorization**: Break down conversations with as many LLMs and steps as needed, for the most precise results.
*   **Modular Design**:  Create self-contained workflows that can then be connected as nodes in larger workflows, reducing complexity.
*   **Cost Control**:  Easily swap models and parameters as needed for cost savings.
