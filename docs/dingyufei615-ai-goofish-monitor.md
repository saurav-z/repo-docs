    | `OPENAI_BASE_URL`   | API endpoint for your AI model (OpenAI-compatible).  | Yes      | E.g., `https://ark.cn-beijing.volces.com/api/v3/`.                                                                                                                                                  |
    | `OPENAI_MODEL_NAME` | The specific multimodal model to use (e.g., `doubao-seed-1-6-250615`, `gemini-2.5-pro`). | Yes      | **Must** choose a multimodal model that supports image analysis.                                                                                                                                                                  |

    > **Debugging Tip:** If encountering 404 errors with your AI API, start by testing with a provider like Alibaba Cloud or Volcano Engine to ensure basic functionality.

    > **Security Note:** The web interface uses Basic Auth. The default username/password are `admin`/`admin123`.  **Change these in production!**

2.  **Login State (Crucial!):**  The scraper needs a valid login. We recommend using the Web UI:

    **Recommended Method: Via Web UI**
    1.  Run the web server (Step 3).
    2.  Go to "System Settings" in the Web UI.
    3.  Click "Manual Update" for the "Login State File."
    4.  Follow the instructions:
        *   Install the Xianyu Login State Extractor browser extension.
        *   Log in to Xianyu on your computer.
        *   Use the extension to extract the login state and copy it to the Web UI.
   
    **Alternative: Login Script** (if you can run a program with a GUI)
    ```bash
    python login.py
    ```
    This will open a browser; scan the QR code with the Xianyu app. A `xianyu_state.json` file is created.

### 3. Start the Web Server:

```bash
python web_server.py
```

### 4. Start Monitoring:

1.  Open `http://127.0.0.1:8000` in your browser.
2.  Go to "Task Management" and click "Create New Task."
3.  Describe your needs (e.g., "Buy a used Sony A7M4, 95% new, under 13k, shutter count under 5000").
4.  The AI will create a monitoring task.
5.  Start or schedule your task!

## üê≥ Docker Deployment (Recommended)

1.  **Docker Installation:**  Ensure Docker Engine is installed.
2.  **Clone & Configure:** Same as steps 1 & 2 from "Getting Started", but for Docker, it is a bit different.
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/dingyufei615/ai-goofish-monitor
    cd ai-goofish-monitor
    ```
    and configure `.env` - follow the environment variables section in "Getting Started"
3.  **Login State (Essential for Docker!):**
    1. Run `docker-compose up -d` to launch the service.
    2. Access the Web UI at `http://127.0.0.1:8000`.
    3.  Go to "System Settings," and click "Manual Update" for the "Login State File."
        *   Follow the Xianyu Login State Extractor setup as described in the manual deployment instructions.
4.  **Run Docker Container:**
    ```bash
    docker-compose up --build -d
    ```

    To stop: `docker-compose stop`.  To remove: `docker-compose down`.

### 5. Key Web UI Features:

*   **Task Management:** AI-powered task creation, visual editing, scheduling.
*   **Result Viewing:** Card-based listing display, filtering by AI recommendations and sorting.
*   **Real-time Logs:** Monitor crawler activity, with options for refresh and clear logs.
*   **System Settings:** Login state checking, Prompt (for AI) editing.

### 6. Workflow:

```mermaid
graph TD
    A[Start Monitoring Task] --> B[Task: Search for Items];
    B --> C{New Item Found?};
    C -- Yes --> D[Fetch Item Details & Seller Info];
    D --> E[Download Item Images];
    E --> F[Call AI for Analysis];
    F --> G{AI Recommends?};
    G -- Yes --> H[Send Notifications];
    H --> I[Save to JSONL];
    G -- No --> I;
    C -- No --> J[Pagination/Wait];
    J --> B;
    I --> C;
```

## üîê Web Interface Authentication:

Protected by Basic Auth.  Configure in `.env`:

```bash
WEB_USERNAME=admin
WEB_PASSWORD=admin123
```

**Change the default credentials in production!**
