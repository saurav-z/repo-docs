    *   **Debugging Tip:** If you encounter 404 errors with the AI API, try debugging using API providers such as Alibaba Cloud or Volcengine to confirm the basic configuration is correct before trying other API providers.

    *   **Security Reminder:** The Web UI has Basic Authentication enabled.  The default username/password is `admin`/`admin123`.  **Change these in production!**

2.  **Get Login State (Crucial!)**:  Provide valid login credentials to access Goofish as a logged-in user. **The Web UI is the recommended way to do this:**

    *   **Recommended: Update via Web UI**
        1.  Skip this step and run step 3 to start the web server.
        2.  Open the Web UI and go to the **"System Settings"** page.
        3.  Find "Login State File" and click the **"Manual Update"** button.
        4.  Follow the instructions in the popup:
            -   Install the [Xianyu login state extraction extension](https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/xianyu-login-state-extrac/eidlpfjiodpigmfcahkmlenhppfklcoa) in your Chrome browser.
            -   Open and log in to the Goofish website.
            -   Click the extension icon in your browser toolbar after successful login.
            -   Click the "Extract Login State" button to get login information.
            -   Click the "Copy to Clipboard" button.
            -   Paste the copied content into the Web UI and save.

        This method is the most convenient because it doesn't require a graphical environment on the server.

    *   **Alternative: Run Login Script (If you can run a GUI)**
        If you can run the program locally or on a server with a desktop environment, you can use the traditional script method:
        ```bash
        python login.py
        ```
        A browser window will open.  Use your **mobile Goofish App to scan the QR code** to log in.  Upon successful login, the program will close and generate a `xianyu_state.json` file in the project's root directory.

### 3. Start the Web Server

Once configured, start the Web UI server:

```bash
python web_server.py
```

### 4. Start Monitoring

1.  Open your web browser to `http://127.0.0.1:8000`.
2.  On the **"Task Management"** page, click **"Create New Task."**
3.  Describe your desired item in natural language (e.g., "Looking for a used Sony A7M4 camera in excellent condition, budget under $1500, under 5000 shutter count"), and fill in the task name and keywords.
4.  Click "Create." The AI will generate a complex analysis standard.
5.  Go back to the main interface, schedule or start your task, and begin automated monitoring!

## üê≥ Docker Deployment (Recommended)

Docker simplifies deployment.

### 1. Docker Prerequisites

1.  **Install Docker:** Make sure you have [Docker Engine](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/) installed.
2.  **Clone and Configure:**

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/dingyufei615/ai-goofish-monitor
    cd ai-goofish-monitor
    ```

3.  **Create `.env`:** Refer to the **[Getting Started](#-getting-started)** section for details and create and configure the `.env` file in the project root.
4.  **Get Login State (Critical!)**:
    After starting the Docker container, set up the login state via the Web UI:
    1.  (On the host machine) Run `docker-compose up -d` to start the service.
    2.  Open your web browser to `http://127.0.0.1:8000` to access the Web UI.
    3.  Go to the **"System Settings"** page, and click the **"Manual Update"** button.
    4.  Follow the instructions in the popup:
        -   Install the [Xianyu login state extraction extension](https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/xianyu-login-state-extrac/eidlpfjiodpigmfcahkmlenhppfklcoa) in your Chrome browser.
        -   Open and log in to the Goofish website.
        -   Click the extension icon in your browser toolbar after successful login.
        -   Click the "Extract Login State" button to get login information.
        -   Click the "Copy to Clipboard" button.
        -   Paste the copied content into the Web UI and save.

    >   ‚ÑπÔ∏è **Python Version:** Docker deploys with Python 3.11 as defined in the Dockerfile; you don't need to worry about local Python version compatibility.

### 2. Run the Docker Container

Use `docker-compose` for streamlined container management:

```bash
docker-compose up --build -d
```

This will start the service in the background. `docker-compose` will use the `.env` and `docker-compose.yaml` configurations to create and launch the container.

If there are network issues inside the container, diagnose it and configure a proxy as necessary.

>   ‚ö†Ô∏è **OpenWrt Deployment Note:** Deployment on OpenWrt routers may cause DNS resolution issues. The default network created by Docker Compose may not inherit OpenWrt's DNS settings properly. If you see an `ERR_CONNECTION_REFUSED` error, check your container network configuration and consider manually configuring DNS or adjusting the network mode.

### 3. Access and Manage

*   **Access Web UI:** Open `http://127.0.0.1:8000` in your browser.
*   **View Real-time Logs:** `docker-compose logs -f`
*   **Stop Container:** `docker-compose stop`
*   **Start Stopped Container:** `docker-compose start`
*   **Stop and Remove Container:** `docker-compose down`

## üì∏ Web UI Feature Overview

*   **Task Management:**
    *   **AI Task Creation:**  Create monitoring tasks and the associated AI analysis criteria by describing your needs in natural language.
    *   **Visual Editing and Control:** Directly modify task parameters (keywords, price, scheduling, etc.) and enable/disable or delete tasks individually.
    *   **Scheduled Execution:** Configure Cron expressions for automated and periodic task runs.
*   **Results Viewing:**
    *   **Card-Based Browsing:**  Display each item in a clear, visual card format.
    *   **Smart Filtering and Sorting:** Filter for items tagged as "Recommended" by the AI and sort by various criteria (crawl time, publish time, price, etc.).
    *   **Deep Details:** Click to view the full scraped data and detailed AI analysis JSON results for each item.
*   **Run Logs:**
    *   **Real-Time Log Streaming:** View detailed crawler logs in real-time within the web interface to monitor progress and troubleshoot issues.
    *   **Log Management:** Support automatic and manual refresh, and one-click clearing of logs.
*   **System Settings:**
    *   **Status Check:** Check the status of key dependencies like the `.env` configuration and login status.
    *   **Prompt Editing:** Edit and save `prompt` files used for AI analysis directly in the web interface, to adjust the AI's reasoning logic in real time.

## üîê Web UI Authentication

### Authentication Configuration

The Web UI employs Basic Authentication to protect access to the management interface and API.

#### Configuration

Set authentication credentials in the `.env` file:

```bash
# Web Service Authentication Configuration
WEB_USERNAME=admin
WEB_PASSWORD=admin123
```

#### Default Credentials

If authentication credentials are not configured in the `.env` file, the system will use these defaults:
- Username: `admin`
- Password: `admin123`

**‚ö†Ô∏è Important: Change the default password in production!**

#### Authentication Scope

- **Requires Authentication:** All API endpoints, Web interface, and static resources.
- **No Authentication Required:** Health check endpoint (`/health`).

#### Usage

1.  **Browser Access:** You'll be prompted for credentials when accessing the Web UI.
2.  **API Calls:**  Include Basic Authentication information in your request headers when making API calls.
3.  **Frontend JavaScript:** Handles authentication automatically.  No modifications needed.

#### Security Recommendations

1.  Change the default password to a strong password.
2.  Use HTTPS in production.
3.  Change authentication credentials regularly.
4.  Restrict access IP ranges via a firewall.

See [AUTH_README.md](AUTH_README.md) for detailed configuration instructions.
