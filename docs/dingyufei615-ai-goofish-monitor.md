## Getting Started

### Quickstart (Web UI Recommended)

The Web UI offers the best user experience.

1.  **Clone the Repository:**

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/dingyufei615/ai-goofish-monitor
    cd ai-goofish-monitor
    ```

2.  **Install Dependencies:**

    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

3.  **Configure `.env`:**

    *   Copy the `.env.example` file and rename it to `.env`.
        ```bash
        # Windows
        copy .env.example .env
        # Linux/MacOS
        cp .env.example .env
        ```

    *   **Required Environment Variables:**

        | Variable          | Description                                      | Required? | Notes                                                                                                                              |
        | :---------------- | :----------------------------------------------- | :-------- | :--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
        | `OPENAI_API_KEY`  | Your AI model provider's API key.                | Yes       |                                                                                                                                    |
        | `OPENAI_BASE_URL` | The API endpoint for your AI model (OpenAI format). | Yes       |  Must be compatible with OpenAI API, e.g., `https://api.example.com/v1`.                                                                  |
        | `OPENAI_MODEL_NAME` | The name of the specific model you want to use.       | Yes       | **Required**: Choose a multimodal model that supports image analysis, such as `gpt-4o`, `gemini-1.5-pro`. |

    *   **Optional Environment Variables:** (See original README for full list and details)

4.  **Get Login State (Crucial!):** Run the login script to generate the session state file.

    ```bash
    python login.py
    ```

    Use your mobile Xianyu App to scan the QR code and log in. This generates the `xianyu_state.json` file.

5.  **Start the Web Server:**

    ```bash
    python web_server.py
    ```

6.  **Access the Web UI:**  Open `http://127.0.0.1:8000` in your browser.  Follow the steps in the UI to create and start your monitoring tasks.

### Docker Deployment (Recommended)

Docker provides a streamlined and reliable deployment.

1.  **Prerequisites:**

    *   Install [Docker Engine](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/).
    *   Clone the project and configure the `.env` file (as described above).

2.  **Get Login State (Important):** **Run the login script on your host machine (not inside Docker)** to generate the `xianyu_state.json` file.

    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    python login.py
    ```

3.  **Run the Docker Container:**

    ```bash
    docker-compose up -d
    ```

4.  **Access and Manage:**

    *   **Web UI:**  `http://127.0.0.1:8000`
    *   **Real-time Logs:** `docker-compose logs -f`
    *   **Stop/Start/Remove Containers:** `docker-compose stop`, `docker-compose start`, `docker-compose down`

### Web UI Features at a Glance

## Project Structure (See original README for file details)

## Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ)

*   **Encoding Errors:** Use `set PYTHONUTF8=1` (Windows) or set an environment variable to UTF-8 before running scripts.
*   **Playwright Install:**  `pip install -r requirements.txt` and/or `playwright install chromium`.
*   **Connection Errors:** Check your network, proxy settings (`PROXY_URL` in `.env`), and `OPENAI_BASE_URL` address.
*   **Model Support:**  Choose an AI model that supports image analysis (Vision / Multi-modal).  Set `OPENAI_MODEL_NAME` correctly.
*   **Docker on Synology NAS:** Follow standard Docker deployment steps, ensuring you get `xianyu_state.json` and mount volumes correctly.
*   **Using Gemini/Qwen/etc.:** Configure `OPENAI_API_KEY`,  `OPENAI_BASE_URL` (API-compatible endpoint), and `OPENAI_MODEL_NAME` correctly in your `.env` file.  Consult your model provider's documentation.
*   **Anti-Scraping:** Reduce the risk of detection by setting `RUN_HEADLESS=false` and using a clean network environment.
