## Quick Start (Web UI Recommended)

The Web UI offers the best user experience.

### 1. Prerequisites:

*   **Python:** Python 3.10+ is recommended for local development to avoid dependency issues.

*   **Clone the Repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/dingyufei615/ai-goofish-monitor
    cd ai-goofish-monitor
    ```

*   **Install Dependencies:**
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

### 2. Configuration:

1.  **Configure Environment Variables:**  Copy `.env.example` to `.env` and adjust the settings:

    ```bash
    # Windows
    copy .env.example .env
    # Linux/macOS
    cp .env.example .env
    ```

    Key Variables:

    | Environment Variable   | Description                                                                     | Required | Notes                                                                                                       |
    | :--------------------- | :------------------------------------------------------------------------------ | :------- | :---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
    | `OPENAI_API_KEY`       | Your AI model provider's API key.                                               | Yes      |                                                                                                             |
    | `OPENAI_BASE_URL`      | AI model API endpoint (OpenAI compatible).                                      | Yes      | For example, `https://ark.cn-beijing.volces.com/api/v3/`.                                                      |
    | `OPENAI_MODEL_NAME`    | The specific model to use (must support image analysis).                        | Yes      | Models like `doubao-seed-1-6-250615` and `gemini-2.5-pro` are supported.                                      |
    | `PROXY_URL`            | (Optional) HTTP/S proxy for bypassing geo-restrictions.                         | No       |  `http://` and `socks5://` formats are supported, e.g., `http://127.0.0.1:7890`.                             |
    | ... (Other notification and UI settings) | ... | ... | ... |

    *   **Debugging Tip:** If you encounter 404 errors with your AI API, test with an API from Alibaba Cloud or Volces to verify basic functionality before switching to other providers.

2.  **Get Login Credentials (Crucial!)**: Obtain valid login credentials to allow the crawler to access Xianyu in a logged-in state.  The Web UI is the easiest way to accomplish this:

    *   **Recommended: Web UI Update**
        1.  Start the Web server (Step 3).
        2.  Open the Web UI and navigate to "System Settings".
        3.  Click the "Manual Update" button next to "Login State File".
        4.  Follow the instructions in the pop-up to:
            *   Install the Xianyu login state extraction extension in Chrome.
            *   Log in to the Xianyu website.
            *   Use the extension to extract and copy your login state.
            *   Paste the login state into the Web UI and save it.

    *   **Alternative:  Login Script (If you can run programs locally):**
        ```bash
        python login.py
        ```
        Scan the QR code that appears with the Xianyu app to log in. This will generate `xianyu_state.json`.

### 3. Start the Web Server:

```bash
python web_server.py
```

### 4. Start Monitoring:

1.  In your browser, go to `http://127.0.0.1:8000`.
2.  Go to "Task Management" -> "Create New Task".
3.  Use natural language to describe your item (e.g., "Buy a Sony A7M4 camera, 95% new, under $1300, under 5000 shutter count").
4.  Fill in other information like name and keywords.  The AI will generate your task.
5.  Enable scheduled execution or start your new task.

## Docker Deployment (Recommended)

Docker provides a simplified and efficient way to deploy.

### 1. Prerequisites (Similar to Local Setup):

1.  **Install Docker:** Ensure Docker Engine is installed ([Docker Engine](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/)).

2.  **Clone and Configure:**

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/dingyufei615/ai-goofish-monitor
    cd ai-goofish-monitor
    ```

3.  **Create `.env`:** Follow the instructions in the Quick Start section to create and populate the `.env` file.

4.  **Get Login State (Critical!)**: You **must** set the login state using the Web UI after starting the Docker container:
    1.  Run `docker-compose up -d` to start the service (in host machine).
    2.  Open the Web UI in your browser, and navigate to http://127.0.0.1:8000.
    3.  Follow the instructions in **"Get Login Credentials"** (Method: Web UI update) in section 2, after you login in web UI.

>   ‚ÑπÔ∏è  The Docker image uses Python 3.11.

### 2. Run the Docker Container:

Use `docker-compose` to manage the container (recommended):

```bash
docker-compose up --build -d
```

### 3. Access and Manage:

*   **Web UI:** Access the web interface at `http://127.0.0.1:8000`.
*   **Real-time Logs:** View logs with `docker-compose logs -f`.
*   **Stop Container:** `docker-compose stop`
*   **Start Container:** `docker-compose start`
*   **Stop and Remove Container:** `docker-compose down`

## Key Web UI Features

*   **Task Management:** Create, edit, schedule, and manage monitoring tasks.
*   **Results Viewing:** Browse results with a visual display, filtering and sorting capabilities.
*   **Real-time Logs:**  View logs to track progress and troubleshoot issues.
*   **System Settings:** Configure the system, including prompt editing and authentication settings.

## Web UI Authentication

This project utilizes Basic authentication to protect the web interface and API endpoints.

*   **Configuration:** Set the credentials in the `.env` file:

    ```bash
    WEB_USERNAME=admin
    WEB_PASSWORD=admin123
    ```

*   **Default Credentials:**  If credentials are not set in the .env file, the default username and password are `admin` and `admin123`.

    **‚ö†Ô∏è Important:**  Change these defaults in production!
