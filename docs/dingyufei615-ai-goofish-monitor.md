## Getting Started:  Web UI (Recommended)

The Web UI provides the best user experience.

### Step 1:  Prerequisites

>   ‚ö†Ô∏è **Python Version:**  Python 3.10 or higher is recommended for local deployment. Lower versions may cause dependency installation issues.

1.  Clone the repository:

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/dingyufei615/ai-goofish-monitor
    cd ai-goofish-monitor
    ```

2.  Install dependencies:

    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

### Step 2: Configuration

1.  **Environment Variables:** Copy `.env.example` to `.env` and configure the settings.

    *   **Windows:**
        ```cmd
        copy .env.example .env
        ```
    *   **Linux/macOS:**
        ```bash
        cp .env.example .env
        ```

    Configuration options in `.env`:

    >   üí° **Debugging Tip:** If you encounter a 404 error when configuring the AI API, try using an API from Alibaba Cloud or Volcano Engine for debugging first to ensure basic functionality.

    >   üîê **Security Reminder:** The Web UI uses Basic Authentication.  Change the default username/password (`admin` / `admin123`) in production!

2.  **Get Login State (Important!)**:  You need valid login credentials to access Xianyu.  We recommend using the Web UI:

    *   **Recommended:  Web UI Method**
        1.  Start the Web service (Step 3).
        2.  Open the Web UI and go to "System Settings."
        3.  Find "Login State File" and click "Manual Update."
        4.  Follow the instructions in the pop-up:
            *   Install the [Xianyu login state extraction extension](https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/xianyu-login-state-extrac/eidlpfjiodpigmfcahkmlenhppfklcoa) in Chrome.
            *   Log in to the Xianyu website.
            *   Click the extension icon, then "Extract Login State."
            *   Click "Copy to Clipboard."
            *   Paste the content into the Web UI and save.

    *   **Alternative:  Run Login Script** (If you can run a graphical program locally or on a server with a desktop environment.)

        ```bash
        python login.py
        ```

        A browser window will open.  **Use the Xianyu App to scan the QR code to log in.**  The script will then close, and a `xianyu_state.json` file will be created in the project root.

### Step 3: Start Web Server

Start the Web UI server after configuration.

```bash
python web_server.py
```

### Step 4:  Start Monitoring

1.  Open `http://127.0.0.1:8000` in your browser.
2.  Go to "Task Management" and click "Create New Task."
3.  Describe your purchase needs in natural language (e.g., "Looking for a used Sony A7M4 camera, 95% new or better, budget under $1000, shutter count below 5000"). Fill in the task name and keywords.
4.  Click "Create."  The AI will generate the analysis criteria.
5.  Start or schedule the task to begin automated monitoring!

## Docker Deployment (Recommended)

Docker simplifies deployment by packaging the application and its dependencies.

### Step 1: Environment Preparation (Similar to Local)

1.  **Install Docker:**  Ensure Docker Engine is installed on your system ([Docker Engine Installation](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/)).

2.  **Clone and Configure:**

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/dingyufei615/ai-goofish-monitor
    cd ai-goofish-monitor
    ```

3.  **Create `.env` File:** Create and populate the `.env` file as described in the [Getting Started](#getting-started-web-ui-recommended) section.

4.  **Get Login State (Critical!)**: You'll set the login state *after* the container starts, using the Web UI:
    1.  Run `docker-compose up -d` (in your host OS) to start the service.
    2.  Open `http://127.0.0.1:8000` in your browser.
    3.  Go to "System Settings" and click "Manual Update."
    4.  Follow the instructions in the pop-up:
            *   Install the [Xianyu login state extraction extension](https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/xianyu-login-state-extrac/eidlpfjiodpigmfcahkmlenhppfklcoa) in Chrome.
            *   Log in to the Xianyu website.
            *   Click the extension icon, then "Extract Login State."
            *   Click "Copy to Clipboard."
            *   Paste the content into the Web UI and save.

>   ‚ÑπÔ∏è **Python Version:** Docker uses Python 3.11 specified in the Dockerfile; no need to worry about local Python version compatibility.

### Step 2: Run Docker Container

The project includes `docker-compose.yaml`.  Use `docker-compose` for convenient container management.

Run in the project root:

```bash
docker-compose up --build -d
```

This will start the service in the background.  `docker-compose` reads the `.env` file and `docker-compose.yaml` to build and start the container.

If you encounter network issues within the container, troubleshoot or use a proxy.

>   ‚ö†Ô∏è **OpenWrt Deployment:** If deploying on an OpenWrt router, you may encounter DNS resolution problems due to how Docker Compose creates the network. If you see `ERR_CONNECTION_REFUSED`, check your container's network configuration.

### Step 3: Access and Management

*   **Access Web UI:** Open `http://127.0.0.1:8000` in your browser.
*   **View Real-time Logs:** `docker-compose logs -f`
*   **Stop Container:** `docker-compose stop`
*   **Start Stopped Container:** `docker-compose start`
*   **Stop and Remove Container:** `docker-compose down`

## Web UI Authentication

### Authentication Configuration

The Web UI utilizes Basic Authentication to ensure access to the management interface and APIs is restricted to authorized users only.

#### Configuration Method

Set authentication credentials in the `.env` file:

```bash
# Web service authentication configuration
WEB_USERNAME=admin
WEB_PASSWORD=admin123
```

#### Default Credentials

If authentication credentials are not set in the `.env` file, the system will use the following defaults:

*   Username: `admin`
*   Password: `admin123`

**‚ö†Ô∏è Important: Change the default password in production!**

#### Authentication Scope

*   **Requires Authentication**: All API endpoints, web interface, and static resources.
*   **Does Not Require Authentication**: Health check endpoint (`/health`).

#### Usage

1.  **Browser Access**: The authentication dialog will pop up when accessing the Web UI.
2.  **API Calls**: Include Basic Authentication information in the request headers.
3.  **Frontend JavaScript**: The authentication will be handled automatically; no modifications are needed.

#### Security Recommendations

1.  Change the default password to a strong password.
2.  Use HTTPS protocol in production environments.
3.  Regularly change authentication credentials.
4.  Restrict the IP range for access via firewall.

For detailed configuration instructions, please refer to [AUTH_README.md](AUTH_README.md).
