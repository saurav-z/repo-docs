# Biomni: Revolutionizing Biomedical Research with AI

**Biomni is a cutting-edge, general-purpose biomedical AI agent designed to accelerate scientific discovery across diverse biomedical fields.**

## Key Features of Biomni

*   **Autonomous Task Execution:** Biomni intelligently executes a wide range of research tasks, from experimental planning to hypothesis generation.
*   **LLM-Powered Reasoning:** Integrates advanced large language models (LLMs) for sophisticated reasoning and problem-solving.
*   **Retrieval-Augmented Planning:** Leverages retrieval-augmented generation to enhance the planning process by accessing external knowledge and data.
*   **Code-Based Execution:** Utilizes code generation and execution capabilities to perform complex biomedical analyses.
*   **Web Interface:** Easily interact with Biomni through a user-friendly web interface for no-code experimentation.

## Getting Started

### Installation

1.  **Environment Setup:** Follow the instructions in the [biomni\_env/README.md](biomni_env/README.md) file to set up the required software environment.
2.  **Activate Environment:** Activate the environment using `conda activate biomni_e1`.
3.  **Install Biomni Package:** Install the Biomni Python package using one of the following methods:

    *   `pip install biomni --upgrade`
    *   `pip install git+https://github.com/snap-stanford/Biomni.git@main` (for the latest updates)
4.  **Configure API Keys:** Set your API keys in your `.bashrc` file:

    ```bash
    export ANTHROPIC_API_KEY="YOUR_API_KEY"
    export OPENAI_API_KEY="YOUR_API_KEY" # optional if you just use Claude
    export AWS_BEARER_TOKEN_BEDROCK="YOUR_BEDROCK_API_KEY" # optional for AWS Bedrock models
    export AWS_REGION="us-east-1" # optional, defaults to us-east-1 for Bedrock
    ```

### Basic Usage

Once the environment is set up, you can start using Biomni:

```python
from biomni.agent import A1

# Initialize the agent with data path, Data lake will be automatically downloaded on first run (~11GB)
agent = A1(path='./data', llm='claude-sonnet-4-20250514')

# Execute biomedical tasks using natural language
agent.go("Plan a CRISPR screen to identify genes that regulate T cell exhaustion, generate 32 genes that maximize the perturbation effect.")
agent.go("Perform scRNA-seq annotation at [PATH] and generate meaningful hypothesis")
agent.go("Predict ADMET properties for this compound: CC(C)CC1=CC=C(C=C1)C(C)C(=O)O")
```
