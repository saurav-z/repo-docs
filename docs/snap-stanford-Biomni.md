# Biomni: Revolutionizing Biomedical Research with AI

**Biomni is a groundbreaking general-purpose AI agent designed to automate complex research tasks and accelerate discoveries across diverse biomedical fields.**

## Key Features

*   **Autonomous Task Execution:** Biomni uses large language models (LLMs) to understand and execute a wide array of biomedical research tasks.
*   **Retrieval-Augmented Planning:** Enhances LLM capabilities by integrating retrieval-augmented planning for more accurate and relevant results.
*   **Code-Based Execution:** Executes code to perform complex analyses, simulations, and data manipulations.
*   **Versatile Applications:** Suitable for a broad range of biomedical subfields, from genomics to drug discovery.
*   **Web Interface:** Accessible and easy to use through a web interface [biomni.stanford.edu](https://biomni.stanford.edu).

## Getting Started

### Installation

1.  **Environment Setup:** Follow the instructions in the [biomni\_env/README.md](biomni_env/README.md) file to set up the necessary environment.
2.  **Activate Environment:** Activate the environment:

    ```bash
    conda activate biomni_e1
    ```

3.  **Install Biomni Package:**

    ```bash
    pip install biomni --upgrade
    ```

    Or, for the latest updates from the GitHub repository:

    ```bash
    pip install git+https://github.com/snap-stanford/Biomni.git@main
    ```

4.  **Configure API Keys:** Configure API keys using one of the following methods:

    *   **Option 1: .env file (Recommended)**
        *   Create a `.env` file in your project directory:
            ```bash
            # Copy the example file
            cp .env.example .env
            ```
        *   Edit the `.env` file with your API keys. See the original README for details.
    *   **Option 2: Shell environment variables**
        *   Set the API keys in your bash profile (`~/.bashrc`). See the original README for details.

    **Note:** See the [docs/known\_conflicts.md](./docs/known_conflicts.md) file for known package conflicts and workarounds.

### Basic Usage

Once your environment is set up:

```python
from biomni.agent import A1

# Initialize the agent with data path, Data lake will be automatically downloaded on first run (~11GB)
agent = A1(path='./data', llm='claude-sonnet-4-20250514')

# Execute biomedical tasks using natural language
agent.go("Plan a CRISPR screen to identify genes that regulate T cell exhaustion, generate 32 genes that maximize the perturbation effect.")
agent.go("Perform scRNA-seq annotation at [PATH] and generate meaningful hypothesis")
agent.go("Predict ADMET properties for this compound: CC(C)CC1=CC=C(C=C1)C(C)C(=O)O")
```

**Important:** If using Azure for your model, always prefix the model name with `azure-` (e.g., `llm='azure-gpt-4o'`).

## Model Context Protocol (MCP) Support

Biomni supports MCP servers for seamless integration with external tools:

```python
from biomni.agent import A1

agent = A1()
agent.add_mcp(config_path="./mcp_config.yaml")
agent.go("Find FDA active ingredient information for ibuprofen")
```

**Built-in MCP Servers:**

For usage and implementation details, refer to the [MCP Integration Documentation](docs/mcp_integration.md) and examples in [`tutorials/examples/add_mcp_server/`](tutorials/examples/add_mcp_server/) and [`tutorials/examples/expose_biomni_server/`](tutorials/examples/expose_biomni_server/).
