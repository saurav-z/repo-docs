# Biomni: Revolutionizing Biomedical Research with AI

**Biomni is a cutting-edge, general-purpose biomedical AI agent designed to accelerate scientific discovery by automating complex research tasks.**

[View the Biomni GitHub Repository](https://github.com/snap-stanford/Biomni)

## Key Features

*   **Automated Task Execution:** Execute a wide array of biomedical research tasks autonomously.
*   **LLM-Powered Reasoning:** Leverages Large Language Models (LLMs) for advanced reasoning capabilities.
*   **Retrieval-Augmented Planning:** Integrates retrieval-augmented planning for enhanced task execution.
*   **Code-Based Execution:** Utilizes code-based execution for accurate and reproducible results.
*   **Web Interface:** Accessible via a user-friendly web interface for easy experimentation and collaboration.
*   **Open Source and Community Driven**: Biomni is open-source and welcomes community contributions, fostering innovation and collaboration.

## Quick Start Guide

### Installation

Setting up the Biomni environment involves a few key steps.  First, ensure you have set up the environment using the provided `setup.sh` script located in the [biomni\_env/README.md](biomni_env/README.md) file.

1.  **Activate Environment:**
    ```bash
    conda activate biomni_e1
    ```
2.  **Install Biomni Package:**
    ```bash
    pip install biomni --upgrade
    ```
    Alternatively, for the latest updates from the GitHub source:
    ```bash
    pip install git+https://github.com/snap-stanford/Biomni.git@main
    ```
3.  **Configure API Keys:**  Set your API keys in your bash profile (`~/.bashrc`):
    ```bash
    export ANTHROPIC_API_KEY="YOUR_API_KEY"
    export OPENAI_API_KEY="YOUR_API_KEY" # optional if you just use Claude
    ```

### Basic Usage

Once your environment is set up, you can start using Biomni with the following example:

```python
from biomni.agent import A1

# Initialize the agent with data path, Data lake will be automatically downloaded on first run (~11GB)
agent = A1(path='./data', llm='claude-sonnet-4-20250514')

# Execute biomedical tasks using natural language
agent.go("Plan a CRISPR screen to identify genes that regulate T cell exhaustion, generate 32 genes that maximize the perturbation effect.")
agent.go("Perform scRNA-seq annotation at [PATH] and generate meaningful hypothesis")
agent.go("Predict ADMET properties for this compound: CC(C)CC1=CC=C(C=C1)C(C)C(=O)O")
```
