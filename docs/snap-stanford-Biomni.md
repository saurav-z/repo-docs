# Biomni: Revolutionizing Biomedical Research with AI

**Biomni is a general-purpose biomedical AI agent designed to accelerate scientific discovery across diverse biomedical fields.**  

**[View the Original Repository](https://github.com/snap-stanford/Biomni)**

## Key Features

*   **Autonomous Task Execution:** Automates complex biomedical research tasks using natural language instructions.
*   **LLM-Powered Reasoning:** Leverages cutting-edge Large Language Models (LLMs) for intelligent reasoning.
*   **Retrieval-Augmented Planning:** Enhances accuracy and context with retrieval-augmented planning.
*   **Code-Based Execution:** Executes tasks via code for reproducible and reliable results.
*   **Versatile Applications:** Designed for a wide range of tasks across various biomedical subfields.
*   **Web Interface:** Explore Biomni's capabilities through our user-friendly web interface at [biomni.stanford.edu](https://biomni.stanford.edu).

## Quick Start

### Installation

1.  **Set up the Environment:** Follow the instructions in the [biomni_env/README.md](biomni_env/README.md) file to set up the necessary software environment.
2.  **Activate the Environment:**
    ```bash
    conda activate biomni_e1
    ```
3.  **Install the Biomni Package:**
    ```bash
    pip install biomni --upgrade
    ```
    Alternatively, install from the GitHub source.
4.  **Configure API Keys:** Add your API keys to your `.bashrc` file:
    ```bash
    export ANTHROPIC_API_KEY="YOUR_API_KEY"
    export OPENAI_API_KEY="YOUR_API_KEY" # optional if you just use Claude
    ```

### Basic Usage

After setting up the environment, use Biomni in Python:

```python
from biomni.agent import A1

# Initialize the agent with data path, Data lake will be automatically downloaded on first run (~11GB)
agent = A1(path='./data', llm='claude-sonnet-4-20250514')

# Execute biomedical tasks using natural language
agent.go("Plan a CRISPR screen to identify genes that regulate T cell exhaustion, generate 32 genes that maximize the perturbation effect.")
agent.go("Perform scRNA-seq annotation at [PATH] and generate meaningful hypothesis")
agent.go("Predict ADMET properties for this compound: CC(C)CC1=CC=C(C=C1)C(C)C(=O)O")
```
