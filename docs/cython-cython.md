# Cython: Optimize Your Python Code with C Speed

**Cython empowers you to write C extensions for Python with ease, boosting performance without sacrificing Python's readability.** Explore the power of this compiler to translate Python code into efficient C/C++ code.  ([Original Repository](https://github.com/cython/cython))

## Key Features

*   **Python-to-C/C++ Compilation:**  Transforms Python code into optimized C/C++ for significant speed gains.
*   **C Function & Type Integration:** Seamlessly calls C functions and declares C types for fine-grained control.
*   **Ideal for Wrapping C Libraries:** Simplifies the integration of existing C/C++ libraries into Python projects.
*   **Speed Up Python Modules:** Create blazing-fast modules to accelerate the execution of your Python code.
*   **Broad Compatibility:** Works with CPython and other C-API implementations.
*   **Manual Optimization:** Offers fine-grained control for manual tuning to generate highly efficient C code.
*   **Mature & Widely Used:**  Backed by a large community, with over 70 million monthly downloads on PyPI.

## Differences from Other Python Compilers

Cython distinguishes itself from other Python compilers with its comprehensive feature set and broad compatibility:

*   **Fast and Compliant:** Offers fast, efficient, and highly compliant support for most Python language features.
*   **Full Runtime Compatibility:** Supports all CPython versions and future versions.
*   **Platform Adaptation:** Adapts to the target platform and Python version at compile time.
*   **Seamless C/C++ Integration:** Makes it easy to work with C/C++ code.
*   **Extensive Optimization:** Supports manual optimization and tuning to the C level.
*   **Mature and Well-Supported:** Benefits from decades of bug fixes and code optimizations.

## Pyrex Origins

Cython is based on Pyrex. Pyrex was created by Greg Ewing, and it is free of restrictions. The latest version of Pyrex can be found [here](https://www.cosc.canterbury.ac.nz/~greg/python/Pyrex/).
