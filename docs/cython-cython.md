# Cython: Write C Extensions for Python with Ease

**Supercharge your Python code with Cython, the optimizing compiler that makes writing C extensions as simple as writing Python itself!**

[Link to Original Repository:](https://github.com/cython/cython)

## Key Features

*   **Python to C/C++ Compilation:** Translates Python code into efficient C/C++ code.
*   **C/C++ Integration:** Seamlessly call C functions and declare C types for fine-grained control.
*   **Performance Optimization:** Enables manual tuning for generating highly optimized C code.
*   **Wrapping C Libraries:** Ideal for wrapping external C libraries and creating fast C modules to accelerate Python code.
*   **Wide Compatibility:** Full runtime compatibility with all still-in-use and future versions of CPython, and support for other C-API implementations.
*   **Large Community:** A large user base with thousands of libraries, packages, and tools.
*   **Mature and Stable:** More than two decades of bug fixing and static code optimizations.

## Installation

If you have a C compiler installed, install Cython using pip:

```bash
pip install Cython
```

For detailed installation instructions, see the [installation page](https://docs.cython.org/en/latest/src/quickstart/install.html).

## Cython vs. Other Python Compilers

Cython stands out from other Python compilers, such as PyPy, Numba, mypyc, Nuitka, and Pythran, by providing:

*   Fast, efficient, and highly compliant support for almost all Python language features.
*   "Generate once, compile everywhere" C code generation for reproducible performance results.
*   C compile time adaptation to the target platform and Python version.
*   Seamless integration with C/C++ code.
*   Broad support for manual optimization and tuning down to the C level.

## History

Cython originated from Pyrex, a language for writing Python extension modules.  Pyrex was created by Greg Ewing.
