# Cython: Write C Extensions for Python with Ease

**Cython empowers developers to write blazing-fast C extensions for Python as effortlessly as writing Python itself.**  This powerful tool translates Python code into highly efficient C/C++ code, enabling significant performance gains and seamless integration with existing C/C++ libraries. Explore the full potential of Cython for optimizing your Python projects.  Learn more about the Cython project on its [GitHub repository](https://github.com/cython/cython).

## Key Features of Cython:

*   **Performance Optimization:**  Translate Python code to C/C++ for significant speed improvements.
*   **C/C++ Integration:**  Easily call C functions and declare C types within your Python code.
*   **Fine-Grained Control:** Manual tuning options allow for highly optimized C code generation.
*   **C Library Wrapping:** Ideal for wrapping external C libraries for use in Python.
*   **Compatibility:** Full runtime compatibility with CPython.
*   **Cross-Platform C Code Generation:** "Generate once, compile everywhere" for reproducible performance.
*   **Mature and Widely Used:** Benefit from over two decades of development and a vast user base with millions of downloads per month.

## Differences from Other Python Compilers

Cython has evolved significantly since its inception in the early 2000s, outlasting many other Python compilers. Some related projects today include:

*   [PyPy](https://www.pypy.org/)
*   [Numba](http://numba.pydata.org/)
*   [Pythran](https://pythran.readthedocs.io/)
*   [mypyc](https://mypyc.readthedocs.io/)
*   [Nuitka](https://nuitka.net/)

Compared to these alternatives, Cython provides:

*   Fast, efficient and highly compliant support for almost all Python language features.
*   Full runtime compatibility with all still-in-use and future versions of CPython.
*   Seamless integration with C/C++ code
*   Broad support for manual optimisation and tuning down to the C level
