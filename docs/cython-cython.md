# Cython: Write C Extensions for Python with Ease

**Supercharge your Python code with Cython, the powerful optimizing compiler that bridges the gap between Python and C/C++ for high-performance computing.**  Check out the original repository on [GitHub](https://github.com/cython/cython).

## Key Features

*   **Python-to-C/C++ Compilation:** Translate Python code into efficient C/C++ code, enabling significant speed improvements.
*   **C/C++ Integration:** Seamlessly call C functions and declare C types directly within your Python code for fine-grained control and optimization.
*   **Optimized Performance:** Generate highly efficient C code, allowing for manual tuning and maximizing performance.
*   **Ideal for Wrapping C Libraries:** Easily integrate and use existing C libraries within your Python projects.
*   **Accelerate Python Modules:** Boost the speed of critical Python code sections by converting them into fast C modules.
*   **Mature and Widely Adopted:**  Boasts over 70 million downloads per month on PyPI, indicating a large and active user base.
*   **Full CPython Compatibility:** Works seamlessly with CPython and other C-API implementations like PyPy and Pyston.
*   **Broad Language Support:** Offers fast, efficient, and highly compliant support for almost all Python language features, including dynamic features and introspection.

## Installation

If you have a C compiler already installed, install Cython with:

```bash
pip install Cython
```

For detailed installation instructions, refer to the [installation page](https://docs.cython.org/en/latest/src/quickstart/install.html).

## Comparing Cython to Other Python Compilers

Cython stands out as a mature and versatile solution among Python compilers, providing a unique blend of performance, compatibility, and ease of use.

Some alternatives include:

*   **PyPy:** JIT compiler with runtime optimizations.
*   **Numba:** JIT compiler for a subset of Python, primarily focused on numerical code.
*   **Pythran:** Static Python-to-C++ compiler for numerical computation.
*   **mypyc:** Static Python-to-C extension compiler.
*   **Nuitka:** Static Python-to-C extension compiler.

**Cython's Advantages:**

*   Fast and efficient
*   Highly compliant with Python
*   Supports almost all Python language features.
*   Generates C code that can be tested and gives repeatable performance.
*   Seamless C/C++ integration
*   Broad support for optimization and tuning down to the C level.
