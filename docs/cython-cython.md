# Cython: Write C Extensions for Python with Ease

**Cython empowers you to write C extensions for Python as effortlessly as writing Python itself, boosting performance and unlocking powerful capabilities.** [Learn more at the original Cython repository](https://github.com/cython/cython).

## Key Features of Cython

*   **Python-to-C Compilation:** Translates Python code into highly optimized C/C++ code for superior performance.
*   **C/C++ Integration:** Seamlessly integrates with existing C and C++ libraries, allowing you to wrap and utilize them within your Python projects.
*   **C Type Declaration:** Enables declaration of C types for variables and class attributes, enabling the compiler to generate highly efficient C code.
*   **Performance Boost:** Accelerates the execution of Python code by compiling performance-critical sections into C extensions.
*   **Wide Compatibility:** Fully compatible with all versions of CPython and other C-API implementations like PyPy and Pyston.
*   **Mature and Reliable:** Benefit from almost two decades of bug fixing and static code optimizations.

## Installation

If you have a C compiler, install Cython easily using pip:

```bash
pip install Cython
```

Otherwise, consult the [installation page](https://docs.cython.org/en/latest/src/quickstart/install.html) in the official documentation.
