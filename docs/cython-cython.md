# Cython: Write C Extensions for Python with Ease

**Cython empowers developers to write high-performance C extensions for Python with a syntax that's remarkably similar to Python itself.**  Learn more about Cython on [GitHub](https://github.com/cython/cython).

## Key Features

*   **Python to C/C++ Compilation:** Translates Python code into highly efficient C/C++ code.
*   **C/C++ Integration:** Seamlessly call C functions and declare C types within your Python code.
*   **Fine-Grained Tuning:** Offers manual optimization capabilities, allowing you to fine-tune code for maximum performance.
*   **Ideal for Wrapping C Libraries:** Simplifies the process of integrating existing C libraries into Python projects.
*   **Fast C Modules:** Accelerates the execution of Python code by creating fast C modules.
*   **Broad Compatibility:** Supports almost all Python language features, including dynamic features and introspection.
*   **CPython Compatibility:** Fully compatible with all current and future versions of CPython.
*   **Mature and Widely Used:** Boasts a large user base and has been refined through over two decades of development.
*   **Open Source:** Licensed under the permissive Apache License.

## Installation

If you have a C compiler already installed, you can install Cython with a single command:

```bash
pip install Cython
```

For detailed installation instructions, please refer to the [installation page](https://docs.cython.org/en/latest/src/quickstart/install.html).

## License

## Cython vs. Other Python Compilers

Cython stands out among Python compilers by offering a unique blend of performance, compatibility, and ease of use. Here's a brief comparison with other prominent projects:

*(The original README provided a detailed comparison table of various compiler options. Due to length and formatting constraints, that comparison is omitted here.  However, the text was retained for reference.)*
