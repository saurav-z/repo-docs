## Key Features

*   **Python-to-C/C++ Translation:** Cython compiles Python code into highly efficient C/C++ code.
*   **C/C++ Integration:** Seamlessly call C functions and declare C types for optimal performance.
*   **Ideal for Wrapping C Libraries:** Cython simplifies integrating external C libraries into your Python projects.
*   **Performance Enhancement:** Accelerate Python code execution with fast C modules.
*   **CPython Compatibility:** Full runtime compatibility with CPython and future versions.
*   **Broad Language Support:** Cython supports almost all Python language features, including dynamic features and introspection
*   **Mature and Widely Used:**  A well-established project with a large user base and continuous improvements.
*   **Cross-Platform:** Generate "compile once, run everywhere" C code.

Cython offers several advantages compared to other Python compilers:

*   **PyPy:**  A Python implementation with a JIT compiler.
*   **Numba:** A JIT compiler for a subset of the language.
*   **Pythran:** A static Python-to-C++ extension compiler, focused on numerical computation.
*   **mypyc:** A static Python-to-C extension compiler, based on mypy.
*   **Nuitka:** A static Python-to-C extension compiler.

Cython provides a balance of flexibility, performance, and Python compatibility that makes it a great choice for many use cases.
