# Cython: Optimize Python Code with C Speed

**Cython empowers Python developers to write C extensions with the simplicity of Python, achieving high performance by compiling Python code to C/C++ code.**  [Learn more at the original Cython repository](https://github.com/cython/cython).

## Key Features:

*   **Python-to-C/C++ Compilation:** Cython translates Python code into efficient C/C++ code, enabling significant performance gains.
*   **C Integration:** Seamlessly integrate and call C functions and declare C types for fine-grained control and optimization.
*   **Ideal for C Library Wrapping:** Easily wrap external C libraries for use in Python.
*   **Performance Boost for Python Modules:** Accelerate the execution of your Python code with fast C modules.
*   **Cross-Platform Compatibility:** Generate "compile once, run everywhere" C code for reproducible performance.
*   **Broad Python Feature Support:** Cython supports nearly all Python language features, including dynamic features and introspection.
*   **CPython Compatibility:** Full runtime compatibility with CPython and future versions.
*   **Manual Optimization:** Provides broad support for manual optimization and tuning down to the C level.

## Installation

Ensure you have a C compiler installed, then install Cython using pip:

```bash
pip install Cython
```

## Differences from Other Python Compilers

Cython stands out among other Python compilers such as PyPy, Numba, and mypyc by offering a unique combination of features:

*   **High Python Compliance:** Excellent support for the Python language, including dynamic features.
*   **CPython Compatibility:** Full compatibility with CPython.
*   **Fine-grained Control:** Allows for low-level optimization and integration with C/C++.
*   **Mature and Stable:** Benefit from over two decades of development and optimization.
