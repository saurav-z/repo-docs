# Cython: Optimize Python Performance with C Speed

**Supercharge your Python code with Cython, the powerful compiler that bridges the gap between Python's ease of use and C's raw performance.**

[![PyPI Downloads](https://img.shields.io/pypi/dm/Cython.svg)](https://pypistats.org/packages/cython)

Cython is a powerful tool for optimizing Python code. It translates Python code into highly efficient C/C++ code, allowing you to achieve significant speed improvements for computationally intensive tasks.  It excels at wrapping external C libraries and creating fast C modules.

## Key Features:

*   **Performance Boost:**  Significantly accelerates Python code execution by compiling to C.
*   **C/C++ Integration:** Seamlessly integrates with C and C++ code, allowing you to call C functions and declare C types for fine-grained control.
*   **Optimized Compilation:**  Provides extensive features for manual tuning and optimization, generating highly efficient C code.
*   **Python Compatibility:** Supports almost all Python language features, ensuring broad compatibility.
*   **Cross-Platform:**  Generates C code that can be compiled on various platforms.
*   **Large Ecosystem:**  Benefit from a mature project with thousands of libraries and tools.
*   **Mature & Stable:**  Over two decades of development, bug fixing, and static code optimizations.
*   **CPython Compatibility:** Full runtime compatibility with all still-in-use and future versions of CPython.

## Installation

If you have a C compiler installed, install Cython with a single command:

```bash
pip install Cython
```

Otherwise, see the [installation page](https://docs.cython.org/en/latest/src/quickstart/install.html) for more detailed instructions.
