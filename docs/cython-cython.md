# Cython: Write C Extensions for Python with Ease

**Cython empowers you to write C extensions for Python as effortlessly as writing Python itself, enabling significant performance gains and seamless integration with C/C++ code.**  Learn more and contribute at the [Cython GitHub repository](https://github.com/cython/cython).

## Key Features

*   **Python-like Syntax for C Extensions:** Write C extensions using a familiar Python syntax, making the transition easy.
*   **C/C++ Integration:** Seamlessly call C functions and declare C types within your Python code.
*   **Performance Optimization:** Cython translates Python code to highly efficient C/C++ code, resulting in substantial speed improvements.
*   **Wrapping External Libraries:** Ideal for wrapping existing C libraries, allowing you to leverage their functionality within Python.
*   **Fast C Modules:** Create high-performance C modules to accelerate the execution of your Python code.
*   **Full CPython Compatibility:**  Works with all current and future versions of CPython.
*   **Large User Base:** Supported by a robust community with thousands of libraries, packages, and tools.
*   **Mature Project:** Benefit from almost two decades of bug fixing and static code optimization.
