# Cython: Write C Extensions for Python with Ease

**Supercharge your Python code with Cython, the optimizing compiler that bridges the gap between Python and C/C++ for blazing-fast performance.** ([View the original repository](https://github.com/cython/cython))

## Key Features of Cython:

*   **Python-to-C Translation:** Converts Python code into efficient C/C++ code.
*   **C/C++ Integration:** Seamlessly calls C functions and declares C types for optimized performance.
*   **Fine-Grained Tuning:** Offers extensive control for manual optimization, generating highly efficient C code.
*   **Ideal for Wrapping Libraries:** Perfect for integrating external C libraries and creating fast C modules.
*   **Large & Active Community:** Boasts a massive user base with thousands of libraries and tools.
*   **Cross-Platform Compatibility:**  Generates platform-independent C code that adapts to the target platform.
*   **Compatibility with CPython and Beyond:** Supports CPython and other C-API implementations such as PyPy and Pyston.
*   **Mature & Stable:** Benefit from over two decades of bug fixes and static code optimizations.
*   **Highly Compliant:** Supports almost all Python language features, including dynamic features and introspection.

## Installation

If you have a C compiler, install Cython using:

```bash
pip install Cython
```

Otherwise, consult the [installation page](https://docs.cython.org/en/latest/src/quickstart/install.html) for detailed instructions.

## Differences Compared to Other Python Compilers

Cython, initially developed in the early 2000s, has evolved significantly. Here's how it differs from other projects:

**Compared to PyPy:** Cython offers a more flexible and compatible solution, particularly with CPython extensions.

**Compared to Numba:** Cython gives more support for low-level optimization and is more comprehensive.

**Compared to MyPyc:** Cython has less opinionated Python type interpretation.

**Compared to Nuitka:** Cython provides support for low-level optimizations and allows for highly compliant support for Python language features.
