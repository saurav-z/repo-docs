# Cython: Write C Extensions for Python with Ease

**Cython empowers Python developers to write fast, efficient C extensions with Python-like syntax, bridging the gap between Python and C/C++.**  [Explore the Cython project on GitHub!](https://github.com/cython/cython)

## Key Features:

*   **Python to C/C++ Compilation:** Cython translates Python code into highly optimized C/C++ code, enabling significant performance gains.
*   **C/C++ Integration:** Seamlessly call C functions and declare C types within your Python code.
*   **Ideal for Extension Modules:** Perfect for wrapping external C libraries and accelerating performance-critical Python code.
*   **Mature and Widely Used:**  Trusted by a large user base with over 60 million downloads per month on PyPI.
*   **Full CPython Compatibility:**  Ensures compatibility with all current and future versions of CPython.
*   **Platform Adaptability:** Generates C code that adapts to the target platform and Python version for reproducible performance.
*   **Apache License:**  Cython is released under the permissive Apache License.

## Cython vs. Other Python Compilers

Cython, born in the early 2000s, has outlasted many attempts to provide static compilers for Python. It offers a unique combination of features:

*   **Fast, efficient, and compliant:** Supports almost all Python features.
*   **Runtime compatibility:** Works with all CPython versions.
*   **"Generate once, compile everywhere":**  Enables reproducible performance.
*   **Seamless integration:** Works well with C/C++ code.

Cython stands out compared to alternatives like PyPy, Numba, Pythran, mypyc, and Nuitka by offering a balance of features for a wide variety of use cases.
