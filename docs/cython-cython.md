Cython is an optimizing static compiler for both the Python programming language and the extended Cython programming language (based on Pyrex). It translates Python code, and optionally annotated Cython code, into highly efficient C/C++ code. This allows for seamless integration with existing C libraries and the creation of fast C modules to accelerate Python code execution. With over 70 million downloads per month, Cython is a proven solution for performance-critical Python projects.

**Key Features of Cython:**

*   **Performance Boost:** Compile Python code to C/C++ for significant speed improvements.
*   **C/C++ Integration:** Seamlessly call C functions and declare C types directly within your Python code.
*   **Fine-Grained Tuning:**  Offers manual optimization and tuning capabilities down to the C level for maximum performance.
*   **Compatibility:** Full runtime compatibility with all current and future versions of CPython.
*   **Cross-Platform:** "Generate once, compile everywhere" C code generation for reproducible performance results and testing.
*   **Large Community:** Benefit from a large user base and extensive library support.
*   **Mature and Stable:** Benefiting from over two decades of bug fixing and code optimization.
*   **Easy to use**: Cython makes writing C extensions for Python as easy as Python itself.

**Get Started:**

**Installation:**

If you have a C compiler installed, simply run:

```bash
pip install Cython
```

Otherwise, refer to the [installation page](https://docs.cython.org/en/latest/src/quickstart/install.html).

**Comparison with Other Python Compilers:**

Cython differentiates itself from other Python compilers like PyPy, Numba, mypyc, and Nuitka by offering a unique blend of language support, performance, and compatibility.  It provides fast, efficient, and highly compliant support for almost all Python language features, including dynamic features and introspection, with seamless integration with C/C++ code.

**Original Pyrex Inspiration:**

Cython is based on the original [Pyrex](https://www.cosc.canterbury.ac.nz/~greg/python/Pyrex/) project by Greg Ewing.
