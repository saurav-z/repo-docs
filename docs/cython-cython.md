# Cython: Supercharge Your Python with C Speed

**Cython** is a powerful and versatile language that lets you write C extensions for Python as easily as Python itself, unlocking significant performance gains. You can find the original repository [here](https://github.com/cython/cython).

## Key Features

*   **Python-to-C/C++ Translation:** Cython converts your Python code into highly efficient C/C++ code.
*   **C and C++ Integration:** Seamlessly call C functions and declare C types for fine-grained control and optimization.
*   **Performance Boost:** Significantly speeds up Python code execution and is ideal for wrapping C libraries.
*   **Broad Compatibility:** Compatible with all current and future versions of CPython.
*   **Mature and Reliable:**  Benefiting from over two decades of development, Cython offers a large user base and thousands of libraries.
*   **Manual Tuning:** Allows broad to fine-grained manual tuning that lets the compiler generate very efficient C code from Cython code.

## Installation

To install Cython, simply use pip:

```bash
pip install Cython
```

If you don't have a C compiler installed, please refer to the [installation page](https://docs.cython.org/en/latest/src/quickstart/install.html) for instructions.
