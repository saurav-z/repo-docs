# Cython: Optimize Python Performance with C Speed ðŸš€

**Cython empowers you to write C extensions for Python as easily as you write Python itself, boosting your code's speed and efficiency.** Explore the power of Cython, a versatile compiler that bridges the gap between Python and C/C++ for high-performance computing. Learn more about the project on the [Cython GitHub repository](https://github.com/cython/cython).

## Key Features

*   **Python-to-C/C++ Compilation:** Translate Python code into highly optimized C/C++ code for significant performance gains.
*   **Seamless C/C++ Integration:** Easily call C functions and declare C types within your Python code.
*   **Fine-Grained Tuning:**  Achieve maximum efficiency with manual optimization capabilities, letting you control code generation at a granular level.
*   **Ideal for Wrapping C Libraries:** Simplify the process of integrating external C libraries into your Python projects.
*   **Fast C Modules:** Accelerate the execution of your Python code by creating fast C modules.
*   **Cross-Platform Compatibility:** "Generate once, compile everywhere" C code generation, ensuring reproducible results across platforms.
*   **Extensive Python Support:** Cython supports almost all Python language features.
*   **Mature and Well-Supported:** Benefit from over two decades of development, bug fixes, and optimizations.

## Installation

To install Cython, if you have a C compiler already, run:

## Comparisons to Other Python Compilers

Cython stands out among other Python compilers, offering a unique blend of features and capabilities. Here's a brief comparison with other popular options:

*   **PyPy:** JIT compiler for runtime optimizations.
*   **Numba:** JIT compiler primarily for numerical code.
*   **Pythran:** Static Python-to-C++ compiler for numerical computation.
*   **mypyc:** Static Python-to-C compiler.
*   **Nuitka:** Static Python-to-C compiler with application linking capabilities.

Cython offers:

*   Full runtime compatibility with all still-in-use and future versions of CPython
*   C compile time adaptation to the target platform and Python version
*   Support for other C-API implementations, including PyPy and Pyston
