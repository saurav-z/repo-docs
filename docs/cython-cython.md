## Key Features

*   **Seamless C Integration:** Call C functions and declare C types directly within your Python code.
*   **Performance Boost:** Translate Python code to highly efficient C/C++ code, accelerating your applications.
*   **Easy C Extension Development:** Write C extensions with Python's familiar syntax.
*   **Mature and Widely Adopted:** Trusted by millions, with over 60 million monthly downloads on PyPI.
*   **Cross-Platform Compatibility:** "Generate once, compile everywhere" C code for reproducible results.
*   **Full CPython Compatibility:** Compatible with all current and future versions of CPython.
*   **Extensive Optimization Capabilities:** Fine-tune your code down to the C level.

## What is Cython?

Cython is a powerful Python compiler that bridges the gap between Python and C, enabling developers to create high-performance extensions for Python. Cython extends Python by allowing you to:

*   Write C extensions using Python-like syntax.
*   Call C functions and libraries directly from your Python code.
*   Declare C types for improved performance.
*   Generate efficient C code from your Cython code.

## Installation

If you have a C compiler installed, simply run:

```bash
pip install Cython
```
