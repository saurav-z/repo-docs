# Cython: Write C Extensions for Python with Ease

**Cython empowers developers to write high-performance C extensions for Python as easily as writing Python itself, resulting in significantly faster code execution.** ([See the original repository](https://github.com/cython/cython))

## Key Features

*   **Python-to-C/C++ Compilation:** Translates Python code into optimized C/C++ code for speed improvements.
*   **C Function and Type Integration:** Allows seamless calling of C functions and declaration of C types within your Python code.
*   **Fine-Grained Tuning:** Offers control for manual optimization, generating highly efficient C code.
*   **Ideal for Wrapping C Libraries:** Simplifies the integration of existing C/C++ libraries into Python.
*   **Fast C Modules:** Creates modules to accelerate the execution of Python code.
*   **Wide Adoption:** With over 70 million downloads per month on PyPI, Cython is a proven tool.

## Installation

If you have a C compiler installed, install Cython with:

```bash
pip install Cython
```

For detailed installation instructions, see the [installation page](https://docs.cython.org/en/latest/src/quickstart/install.html).

## Differences from Other Python Compilers

Cython distinguishes itself from other Python compilers by offering:

*   Fast, efficient, and highly compliant support for almost all Python language features.
*   Full runtime compatibility with CPython.
*   "Generate once, compile everywhere" C code generation.
*   Adaptation to the target platform and Python version.
*   Support for other C-API implementations, including PyPy and Pyston.
*   Seamless integration with C/C++ code.
*   Broad support for manual optimization.
*   A large user base with thousands of libraries and tools.
*   Two decades of bug fixing and static code optimizations.
