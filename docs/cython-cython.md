# Cython: Write C Extensions for Python with Ease

**Cython empowers Python developers to write high-performance C extensions with Python-like syntax, bridging the gap between Python and C/C++ for optimal speed and efficiency.**  Learn more at the [Cython GitHub Repository](https://github.com/cython/cython).

## Key Features of Cython:

*   **Python-like Syntax for C Extensions:**  Write C extensions using a syntax very similar to Python, making it easy to learn and use.
*   **Seamless C/C++ Integration:**  Call C functions and declare C types directly within your Python code, facilitating efficient interaction with existing C/C++ libraries.
*   **Optimizing Python Compiler:** Cython translates Python code to C/C++ code, enabling broad to fine-grained manual tuning for highly optimized C code generation.
*   **Ideal for Wrapping C Libraries:** Quickly and easily wrap external C libraries for use in Python, expanding Python's capabilities.
*   **Accelerate Python Code:** Create fast C modules to significantly speed up the execution of your Python applications.
*   **Mature and Widely Used:** With over 70 million monthly downloads on PyPI, Cython is a proven tool for performance-critical Python projects.
*   **Full CPython Compatibility:**  Ensures that your Cython code runs seamlessly with all current and future versions of CPython.
*   **Cross-Platform C Code Generation:** "Generate once, compile everywhere" approach.

## Installation

If you have a C compiler installed, you can install Cython with:

```bash
pip install Cython
```

Otherwise, see the [installation page](https://docs.cython.org/en/latest/src/quickstart/install.html) for detailed instructions.

## Comparison with Other Python Compilers

Cython has outlived most other attempts at producing static compilers for Python. Key distinctions include:

*   **Focus on CPython Compatibility:** Cython is designed for seamless integration and full runtime compatibility with CPython.
*   **Fine-Grained Control:** Offers advanced features for manual optimization and C-level tuning.
*   **Mature and Proven:**  Benefit from over two decades of development and a large user base.
