# Cython: Write C Extensions for Python with Ease

**Cython empowers you to write blazing-fast C extensions for Python as easily as you write Python itself, bridging the gap between Python's elegance and C's performance.**  Learn more and contribute to the Cython project on [GitHub](https://github.com/cython/cython).

## Key Features

*   **Python-to-C Translation:** Converts Python code into highly efficient C/C++ code.
*   **C Integration:** Seamlessly calls C functions and declares C types for optimal performance.
*   **Wrapping C Libraries:** Ideal for creating Python wrappers for existing C libraries.
*   **Accelerated Python Modules:** Boosts the speed of your Python code through fast C modules.
*   **Compatibility:** Full runtime compatibility with all current and future versions of CPython.
*   **Optimization:** Broad support for manual optimization and tuning down to the C level.
*   **Mature and Reliable:**  Benefit from almost two decades of bug fixing and static code optimizations.

## Installation

If you have a C compiler, install Cython with:

```bash
pip install Cython
```

Otherwise, consult the [installation page](https://docs.cython.org/en/latest/src/quickstart/install.html) for setup instructions.

## Cython vs. Other Python Compilers

Cython stands out from other Python compilers like PyPy, Numba, Pythran, mypyc, and Nuitka by providing:

*   Fast, efficient, and highly compliant support for almost all Python language features.
*   "Generate once, compile everywhere" C code generation, enabling reproducible performance and testing.
*   Adaptation to the target platform and Python version at compile time.
*   Seamless integration with C/C++ code.
*   A large, active user base with thousands of libraries and tools.
