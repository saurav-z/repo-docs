# Cython: Write C Extensions for Python with Ease

**Cython empowers developers to write C extensions for Python as easily as writing Python itself, enabling significant performance gains.**  [Learn more at the original repository](https://github.com/cython/cython).

## Key Features

*   **Optimizing Python Compiler:** Translates Python code into highly efficient C/C++ code.
*   **C Integration:** Seamlessly calls C functions and declares C types for fine-grained control.
*   **Performance Boost:** Significantly speeds up Python code execution and is ideal for wrapping C libraries.
*   **Broad Compatibility:** Full runtime compatibility with CPython, and supports other C-API implementations like PyPy and Pyston.
*   **Mature and Widely Used:** Boasts over 70 million downloads per month on PyPI, with a large user base and extensive library support.
*   **Manual Optimization:** Provides broad support for manual optimization and tuning down to the C level.
*   **"Generate Once, Compile Everywhere":** Supports C code generation that allows for reproducible performance results and testing

## Installation

To install Cython, ensure you have a C compiler and then run:

```bash
pip install Cython
```

## Differences from Other Python Compilers

Cython, which started in the early 2000s, has outlived most other attempts at producing static compilers for the Python language.

**Key advantages over alternatives:**

*   Fast, efficient, and highly compliant support for almost all Python language features.
*   Full runtime compatibility with all still-in-use and future versions of CPython.
*   Seamless integration with C/C++ code.
*   "Generate once, compile everywhere" C code generation.
*   Support for other C-API implementations, including PyPy and Pyston.
*   Broad support for manual optimization and tuning down to the C level.
*   A large user base with thousands of libraries, packages, and tools.
*   More than two decades of bug fixing and static code optimizations.
