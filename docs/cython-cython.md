# Cython: Write C Extensions for Python with Ease

**Cython empowers you to write blazing-fast C extensions for Python, making it as easy as writing Python itself.** [Explore the original Cython repository on GitHub](https://github.com/cython/cython).

## Key Features

*   **Python-to-C/C++ Translation:** Converts Python code into highly optimized C/C++ code.
*   **C Function and Type Integration:** Seamlessly call C functions and declare C types for fine-grained control and performance tuning.
*   **Ideal for Wrapping C Libraries:** Easily integrate and utilize external C libraries within your Python projects.
*   **Accelerate Python Code:** Create fast C modules to significantly speed up the execution of your Python programs.
*   **Cross-Platform Compatibility:** "Generate once, compile everywhere" C code for consistent performance across different platforms and Python versions.
*   **Mature and Widely Used:** Benefiting from over two decades of development and a large user base with thousands of libraries.

## Installation

Ensure you have a C compiler installed, then install Cython with:

```bash
pip install Cython
```

For detailed installation instructions, see the [installation page](https://docs.cython.org/en/latest/src/quickstart/install.html).

## Cython vs. Other Python Compilers

Cython distinguishes itself from other Python compilers with its:

*   **Full CPython Compatibility:** Works seamlessly with all current and future CPython versions.
*   **Dynamic Features Support:** Broad support for Python's dynamic features and introspection.
*   **Manual Optimization:** Extensive support for low-level optimization and tuning.
*   **Seamless Integration with C/C++:** Easy interaction with external C/C++ code.
*   **Mature Development:**  Benefit from over two decades of bug fixing and static code optimizations.
