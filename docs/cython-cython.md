# Cython: Write C Extensions for Python with Ease

**Cython empowers you to write high-performance C extensions for Python as easily as you write Python itself, boosting your code's speed and efficiency.**  Learn more and contribute at the official [Cython repository](https://github.com/cython/cython).

## Key Features

*   **Python-to-C/C++ Compilation:** Cython translates Python code into highly optimized C/C++ code.
*   **C/C++ Integration:** Seamlessly call C functions and declare C types within your Python code.
*   **Fine-Grained Optimization:** Manual tuning capabilities allow for efficient C code generation.
*   **Ideal for C Library Wrapping:** Easily wrap external C libraries for Python use.
*   **High-Performance Modules:** Create fast C modules to accelerate Python code execution.
*   **Full CPython Compatibility:** Cython is fully compatible with all current and future CPython versions.
*   **Cross-Platform Support:**  "Generate once, compile everywhere" C code for reproducible performance.
*   **Active Community:** Backed by a large user base with thousands of libraries, packages, and tools.
*   **Mature and Stable:** Built upon two decades of development, bug fixes, and static code optimizations.

## Installation

Ensure you have a C compiler and then simply install Cython using pip:

```bash
pip install Cython
