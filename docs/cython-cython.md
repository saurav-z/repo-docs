# Cython: Write C Extensions for Python with Ease

**Cython empowers you to write C extensions for Python as easily as you write Python itself, dramatically boosting your code's performance.** ([See the original repository](https://github.com/cython/cython))

## Key Features

*   **Python-to-C/C++ Compilation:** Translates Python code into highly efficient C/C++ code.
*   **C/C++ Integration:** Seamlessly integrates with C functions and allows you to declare C types, enabling optimal performance.
*   **Performance Boost:** Ideal for wrapping external C libraries and creating fast C modules to accelerate Python code execution.
*   **Extensive Support:** Supports nearly all Python features, ensuring high compliance with the Python language.
*   **CPython Compatibility:** Full runtime compatibility with all current and future CPython versions.
*   **Platform Adaptation:** C compilation adapts to the target platform and Python version.
*   **C/C++ Code Generation:** "Generate once, compile everywhere" approach provides reproducible performance results and enables testing.
*   **Mature Project:** Benefit from two decades of bug fixes and static code optimizations.
