# Cython: Optimize Python Performance with C Speed

**Supercharge your Python code with Cython, a powerful optimizing compiler that bridges the gap between Python and C/C++ for lightning-fast execution.** [Learn more on the original Cython repository](https://github.com/cython/cython).

## Key Features of Cython

*   **Performance Boost:** Translates Python code into highly efficient C/C++ code, significantly speeding up execution.
*   **Seamless Integration:**  Effortlessly calls C functions and declares C types, allowing for fine-grained optimization.
*   **C Library Wrapping:** Ideal for wrapping external C libraries, enabling Python to leverage existing C codebases.
*   **CPython Compatibility:** Full runtime compatibility with all versions of CPython.
*   **Cross-Platform Optimization:** C code generation adapted to the target platform and Python version.
*   **Large Community & Ecosystem:**  Benefit from a mature project with extensive documentation, a large user base, and thousands of compatible libraries.
*   **Mature and Stable:**  Over two decades of development with robust bug fixes and static code optimizations.

## Why Choose Cython?

Cython offers a unique blend of Python's ease of use and C's raw performance, providing:

*   **Near-native speed:** By allowing you to write C extensions as easily as Python, Cython unlocks dramatic speed improvements.
*   **Compatibility:**  Cython is compatible with all future versions of CPython.
*   **Optimization Control:**  Fine-tune code for specific performance needs with low-level control.
*   **Existing Code Integration:**  Easily integrate and leverage existing C/C++ code.
*   **Reproducible Results:** C code generation allows for reproducible performance results and comprehensive testing.

## Installation

Install Cython easily using pip:

```bash
pip install Cython
```

## Cython vs. Other Python Compilers

Cython stands out from other Python compilers by offering:

*   Fast, efficient, and highly compliant support for almost all Python language features.
*   Full runtime compatibility with all still-in-use and future versions of CPython.
*   "Generate once, compile everywhere" C code generation that allows for reproducible performance results and testing.
*   C compile time adaptation to the target platform and Python version.
*   Support for other C-API implementations, including PyPy and Pyston.
*   Seamless integration with C/C++ code.
*   Broad support for manual optimisation and tuning down to the C level.
*   A large user base with thousands of libraries, packages and tools.
*   More than two decades of bug fixing and static code optimisations.

Some alternative compilers include:

*   **PyPy:** Python implementation with JIT compiler
*   **Numba:** JIT compiler for a subset of the language, based on LLVM
*   **Pythran:** Static Python-to-C++ extension compiler
*   **mypyc:** Static Python-to-C extension compiler
*   **Nuitka:** Static Python-to-C extension compiler
