# Cython: Write C Extensions for Python with Ease

**Supercharge your Python code's performance by translating it into highly efficient C/C++ code with Cython, the optimizing Python compiler.** Learn more at the [Cython GitHub repository](https://github.com/cython/cython).

## Key Features

*   **Optimized Performance:** Cython compiles Python code to C/C++, enabling significant speed improvements.
*   **C/C++ Integration:** Seamlessly call C functions and declare C types within your Python code.
*   **Fine-Grained Control:** Offers both broad and fine-grained tuning options for maximum performance optimization.
*   **Ideal for C Libraries:** Perfect for wrapping external C libraries and creating fast C modules.
*   **Broad Python Compatibility:** Supports almost all Python language features, including dynamic features and introspection.
*   **Cross-Platform Support:** "Generate once, compile everywhere" C code generation adaptable to different platforms and Python versions.
*   **Active Community:** Backed by a large user base and over two decades of development with extensive bug fixing and optimizations.

## Installation

If you have a C compiler, install Cython with:

```bash
pip install Cython
```

Otherwise, refer to the [installation guide](https://docs.cython.org/en/latest/src/quickstart/install.html).

## Alternatives to Cython

Compared to alternatives, Cython offers a unique blend of performance, compliance, and flexibility. Here are some other Python compilers:

*   **PyPy:** JIT compiler, good integration with C/C++. Cons: non-CPython runtime, limited extension compatibility.
*   **Numba:** JIT compiler for a subset of Python, focused on numerical code. Cons: limited language support, dependencies.
*   **Pythran:** Static Python-to-C++ compiler for numerical computation.
*   **mypyc:** Static Python-to-C compiler, based on mypy. Cons: reduced Python compatibility.
*   **Nuitka:** Static Python-to-C compiler. Cons: no support for low-level optimizations.
