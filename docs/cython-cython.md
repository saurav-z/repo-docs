# Cython: Write C Extensions for Python with Ease

**Supercharge your Python code with Cython, the optimizing compiler that bridges the gap between Python and C/C++, boosting performance and enabling seamless integration with C libraries.**  Explore the power of Cython, a versatile tool designed to optimize Python code, create fast C extensions, and integrate with C/C++ libraries.  This README provides an overview of Cython, its key features, and how to get started.  [Visit the Cython Repository on GitHub](https://github.com/cython/cython) for the latest updates and contributions.

## Key Features of Cython:

*   **Python-to-C/C++ Compilation:** Translates Python code into efficient C/C++ code for significant performance gains.
*   **C/C++ Integration:**  Allows you to call C functions and declare C types directly within your Python code.
*   **Fine-Grained Optimization:** Provides manual tuning options for generating highly optimized C code.
*   **C Library Wrapping:**  Ideal for wrapping and utilizing external C libraries within Python.
*   **Performance Boost:** Enables the creation of fast C modules to accelerate Python code execution.
*   **CPython Compatibility:**  Maintains full runtime compatibility with all CPython versions.
*   **Cross-Platform Support:** "Generate once, compile everywhere" C code for consistent performance across different platforms.
*   **Mature and Widely Used:**  Backed by a large user base and over two decades of development.
*   **Open Source:**  Licensed under the permissive Apache License, free to use and modify.

## Installation

If you have a C compiler installed, the easiest way to install Cython is using pip:

```bash
pip install Cython
```

For detailed installation instructions, including how to set up a C compiler, refer to the [Cython installation page](https://docs.cython.org/en/latest/src/quickstart/install.html).
