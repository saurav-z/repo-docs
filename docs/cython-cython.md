# Cython: Write C Extensions for Python with Ease

**Cython enables you to write C extensions for Python as easily as you would write Python itself, leading to significantly faster and more efficient code.** ([Original Repository](https://github.com/cython/cython))

## Key Features of Cython:

*   **Python-to-C/C++ Compilation:** Translates Python code into highly optimized C/C++ code for performance gains.
*   **C/C++ Integration:** Seamlessly call C functions and declare C types within your Python code for efficient interaction with C libraries.
*   **Ideal for C Library Wrapping:** Simplifies the process of wrapping and integrating existing C libraries into Python projects.
*   **Accelerate Python Modules:** Speed up the execution of your Python code by leveraging the power of C compilation.
*   **Compatibility:** Full runtime compatibility with all still-in-use and future versions of CPython.
*   **Optimization:** Broad support for manual optimization and tuning down to the C level.
*   **Large User Base:** Supported by a large community, and is used in thousands of libraries, packages, and tools.
*   **Proven:** Almost two decades of bug fixing and static code optimizations.

## Installation

If you have a C compiler installed, simply run:

```bash
pip install Cython
```

For detailed installation instructions, see the [installation page](https://docs.cython.org/en/latest/src/quickstart/install.html) in the documentation.
