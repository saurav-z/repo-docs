# Cython: Write C Extensions for Python with Ease

**Cython empowers you to write high-performance C extensions for Python as easily as you write Python itself.**  ([View the original repository](https://github.com/cython/cython))

Cython is an optimizing static compiler that translates a variant of Python code into highly efficient C/C++ code. It bridges the gap between Python's ease of use and C's performance by allowing you to:

*   **Write C Extensions with Python Syntax:**  Code using familiar Python syntax, augmented with C type declarations for optimal performance.
*   **Seamlessly Integrate with C/C++:** Call C functions and use C types directly within your Cython code.
*   **Fine-Grained Control:**  Tune your code with fine-grained manual optimizations to generate very efficient C code.
*   **Ideal for Wrapping C Libraries:** Easily create Python bindings for existing C libraries, unlocking their power in your Python projects.
*   **Boost Python Code Execution:** Speed up performance-critical sections of your Python code with compiled C modules.

**Key Features:**

*   **High Performance:** Generate optimized C/C++ code for significant speed improvements.
*   **Python Compatibility:**  Full runtime compatibility with all current and future versions of CPython.
*   **C/C++ Interoperability:**  Seamless integration with existing C and C++ codebases.
*   **Manual Optimization:** Fine-tune your code at the C level for maximum performance.
*   **Cross-Platform Compatibility:** Generate C code that adapts to the target platform and Python version.
*   **Large Community & Ecosystem:** Leverage a mature project with a vast user base and thousands of libraries.

**Installation:**

If you have a C compiler installed, simply run:

```bash
pip install Cython
```

Otherwise, see the [installation page](https://docs.cython.org/en/latest/src/quickstart/install.html) for detailed instructions.

**Differences from Other Python Compilers:**

Cython distinguishes itself from other Python compilers like PyPy, Numba, and Nuitka by providing:

*   Fast, efficient, and highly compliant support for almost all Python language features.
*   "Generate once, compile everywhere" C code generation that allows for reproducible performance results and testing.
*   Seamless integration with C/C++ code, including a broad range of manual optimization capabilities.
*   More than two decades of bug fixing and static code optimizations.

**Project Statistics:**

Cython sees [over 70 million downloads](https://pypistats.org/packages/cython) per month on PyPI, demonstrating its widespread use and impact.
