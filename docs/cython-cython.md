## Key Features

*   **Python-to-C/C++ Compilation:** Cython translates Python code into C/C++ code.
*   **C/C++ Integration:** Seamlessly call C functions and declare C types for fine-grained control.
*   **Performance Optimization:**  Fine-tune your code to generate highly efficient C code.
*   **Wrapping C Libraries:** Ideal for wrapping external C libraries.
*   **Fast C Modules:**  Accelerate the execution of your Python code with fast C modules.
*   **Broad Python Support:** Supports almost all Python language features, including dynamic features and introspection.
*   **CPython Compatibility:** Full runtime compatibility with all current and future CPython versions.
*   **Cross-Platform:** "Generate once, compile everywhere" C code generation for reproducible results.
*   **Mature and Widely Used:**  A large user base with thousands of libraries and tools, backed by over two decades of development.

## Installation

If you have a C compiler installed, simply run:

```bash
pip install Cython
```

## Differences from Other Python Compilers

Cython provides a unique set of features compared to other Python compilers:

*   **JIT Compilers (e.g., PyPy, Numba):** Focus on runtime optimizations; Cython excels at static compilation with fine-grained control.
*   **Static Compilers (e.g., mypyc, Nuitka):** Cython offers broader Python language support, low-level optimizations, and seamless C/C++ integration.
