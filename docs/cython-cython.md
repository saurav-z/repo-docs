# Cython: Write C Extensions for Python with Ease ðŸš€

**Cython empowers developers to write C extensions for Python with Python-like syntax, significantly boosting performance and unlocking the power of C/C++ code.**  Explore the possibilities with Cython! ([See the original repo](https://github.com/cython/cython))

## Key Features

*   **Python-Like Syntax:** Write C extensions using a syntax that closely resembles Python, making the learning curve gentle.
*   **C/C++ Integration:** Seamlessly call C functions and declare C types, allowing for fine-grained control and optimization.
*   **Performance Boost:** Translate Python code into highly efficient C/C++ code, dramatically speeding up execution.
*   **C Library Wrapping:** Easily wrap and integrate external C libraries into your Python projects.
*   **Wide Compatibility:** Compatible with a broad range of Python versions and CPython implementations.
*   **Mature and Stable:** Benefit from over two decades of development, bug fixes, and performance optimizations.
*   **Large Community:** Join a thriving community with thousands of libraries, packages, and tools already utilizing Cython.
*   **Cross-Platform Support:**  "Generate once, compile everywhere" C code for reproducible performance results across platforms.
*   **Manual Optimization:** Broad support for manual optimization and tuning down to the C level.

## Installation

If you have a C compiler installed, installation is simple:

```bash
pip install Cython
```

## Comparisons to Other Python Compilers

Cython has outlived most other attempts at producing static compilers for the Python language. Here's a brief comparison with similar projects:

*   **PyPy:** A Python implementation with a JIT compiler.
*   **Numba:** A Python extension with a JIT compiler for numerical code, based on LLVM.
*   **Pythran:** A static Python-to-C++ extension compiler, primarily for numerical computation.
*   **mypyc:** A static Python-to-C extension compiler, based on mypy.
*   **Nuitka:** A static Python-to-C extension compiler.

Compared to these, Cython offers:

*   Fast, efficient and highly compliant support for almost all Python language features, including dynamic features and introspection.
*   Full runtime compatibility with all still-in-use and future versions of CPython.
*   "Generate once, compile everywhere" C code generation that allows for reproducible performance results and testing.
*   C compile time adaptation to the target platform and Python version.
*   Support for other C-API implementations, including PyPy and Pyston.
*   Seamless integration with C/C++ code.
*   Broad support for manual optimisation and tuning down to the C level.
*   A large user base with thousands of libraries, packages and tools.
*   More than two decades of bug fixing and static code optimisations.
