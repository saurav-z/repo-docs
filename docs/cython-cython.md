# Cython: Write C Extensions for Python with Ease ðŸš€

**Cython empowers Python developers to write C extensions as easily as writing Python itself, boosting performance and integrating seamlessly with existing C/C++ code.**  [Visit the Cython Repository on GitHub](https://github.com/cython/cython)

## Key Features

*   **Performance Enhancement:** Translate Python code to C/C++ for significant speed improvements.
*   **C/C++ Integration:** Easily call C functions and declare C types directly within your Python code.
*   **Fine-Grained Control:** Optimize performance with broad to fine-grained manual tuning, generating efficient C code.
*   **C Library Wrapping:** Ideal for wrapping external C libraries and creating fast C modules.
*   **CPython Compatibility:** Full runtime compatibility with all still-in-use and future versions of CPython.
*   **Cross-Platform Compilation:** "Generate once, compile everywhere" C code generation ensures reproducible results.
*   **Extensive Ecosystem:** Leverage a large user base with thousands of libraries, packages, and tools.
*   **Mature and Stable:** Benefit from over two decades of bug fixing and static code optimizations.
*   **Seamless Integration:** Integrates seamlessly with C/C++ code.
*   **Dynamic Feature Support:** Highly compliant support for almost all Python language features, including dynamic features and introspection.

## Comparison with Other Python Compilers

Cython offers unique advantages compared to other Python compilers:

*   **PyPy:** JIT compilation, good C/C++ integration, but non-CPython runtime.
*   **Numba:** JIT for a subset of the language, primarily for numerical code.
*   **Pythran:** Static Python-to-C++ compiler, focused on numerical computation.
*   **mypyc:** Static Python-to-C extension compiler, utilizes PEP-484 type annotations.
*   **Nuitka:** Static Python-to-C extension compiler, supports static application linking.

Cython stands out with its high Python language compliance, seamless C/C++ integration, and focus on low-level optimizations, making it a powerful tool for Python developers.
