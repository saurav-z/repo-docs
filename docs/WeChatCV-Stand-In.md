## Stand-In: Preserve Identities in Your Videos

**Stand-In** is a cutting-edge, plug-and-play framework designed to revolutionize video generation by ensuring consistent identities. By training only a tiny fraction of additional parameters (just 1%!), Stand-In achieves state-of-the-art results in both Face Similarity and Naturalness, surpassing methods requiring full-parameter training.  Want to know more?  Explore the original repo [here](https://github.com/WeChatCV/Stand-In).

**Key Features:**

*   ‚úÖ **Efficient Training:** Train with only 1% additional parameters.
*   ‚úÖ **High Fidelity:** Maintain outstanding identity consistency.
*   ‚úÖ **Plug-and-Play:** Seamlessly integrates into existing T2V (Text-to-Video) models.
*   ‚úÖ **Extensible:** Compatible with LoRA and various downstream video tasks.

## üöÄ Quick Start: Get Up and Running!

### 1. Environment Setup

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/WeChatCV/Stand-In.git
cd Stand-In

# Create and activate Conda environment
conda create -n Stand-In python=3.11 -y
conda activate Stand-In

# Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt

# (Optional) Install Flash Attention for faster inference
pip install flash-attn --no-build-isolation
```

### 2. Model Download

```bash
python download_models.py
```

This script downloads:

*   `wan2.1-T2V-14B` (base text-to-video model)
*   `antelopev2` (face recognition model)
*   `Stand-In` (our Stand-In model)

> **Note:**  If you have `wan2.1-T2V-14B` already, modify `download_model.py`.

## üß™ Usage: Generate Your Videos!

### Standard Inference

```bash
python infer.py \
    --prompt "A man sits comfortably at a desk, facing the camera as if talking to a friend or family member on the screen. His gaze is focused and gentle, with a natural smile. The background is his carefully decorated personal space, with photos and a world map on the wall, conveying a sense of intimate and modern communication." \
    --ip_image "test/input/lecun.jpg" \
    --output "test/output/lecun.mp4"
```

**Prompt Tips:** Avoid detailed descriptions of the subject's appearance (e.g., just *"a man"*).  Prompts support both English and Chinese. Ideal for frontal, medium-to-close-up shots.

**Input Image:** Use high-resolution frontal face images for best results.

### Inference with Community LoRA

```bash
python infer_with_lora.py \
    --prompt "A man sits comfortably at a desk, facing the camera as if talking to a friend or family member on the screen. His gaze is focused and gentle, with a natural smile. The background is his carefully decorated personal space, with photos and a world map on the wall, conveying a sense of intimate and modern communication." \
    --ip_image "test/input/lecun.jpg" \
    --output "test/output/lecun.mp4" \
    --lora_path "path/to/your/lora.safetensors" \
    --lora_scale 1.0
```

**Recommended LoRA:** [https://civitai.com/models/1404755/studio-ghibli-wan21-t2v-14b](https://civitai.com/models/1404755/studio-ghibli-wan21-t2v-14b)

### Video Face Swapping

```bash
python infer_face_swap.py \
    --prompt "The video features a woman standing in front of a large screen displaying the words ""Tech Minute"" and the logo for CNET. She is wearing a purple top and appears to be presenting or speaking about technology-related topics. The background includes a cityscape with tall buildings, suggesting an urban setting. The woman seems to be engaged in a discussion or providing information on technology news or trends. The overall atmosphere is professional and informative, likely aimed at educating viewers about the latest developments in the tech industry." \
    --ip_image "test/input/ruonan.jpg" \
    --output "test/output/ruonan.mp4" \
    --denoising_strength 0.85
```

**Important Face Swap Note:** This feature is experimental. Adjust `--denoising_strength` to balance background redraw and face naturalness.  Use `--force_background_consistency` with caution.

### Infer with VACE

```bash
python infer_with_vace.py \
    --prompt "A woman raises her hands." \
    --vace_path "checkpoints/VACE/" \
    --ip_image "test/input/first_frame.png" \
    --reference_video "test/input/pose.mp4" \
    --reference_image "test/input/first_frame.png" \
    --output "test/output/woman.mp4" \
    --vace_scale 0.8
```

Download VACE weights or provide the path via `--vace_path`.

```bash
python download_models.py --vace
```

Preprocess the input control video using VACE's tools. Adjust `--vace_scale` to balance motion and identity preservation.  Contact us with any questions.
