## Getting Started

### 1. Environment Setup

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/WeChatCV/Stand-In.git
cd Stand-In

# Create and activate a Conda environment
conda create -n Stand-In python=3.11 -y
conda activate Stand-In

# Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt

# (Optional) Install Flash Attention for faster inference (check compatibility)
pip install flash-attn --no-build-isolation
```

### 2. Model Download

Run the download script to automatically fetch all required models into the `checkpoints` directory:

```bash
python download_models.py
```

This downloads:

*   `wan2.1-T2V-14B` (base model)
*   `antelopev2` (face recognition)
*   `Stand-In` (our model)

>   **Note:** If you have the base model already, modify the `download_model.py` script to comment out the relevant download and place the model in the appropriate directory.

---

## Usage

### Standard Inference

Generate videos with identity preservation using `infer.py`:

```bash
python infer.py \
    --prompt "A man sits comfortably at a desk, facing the camera as if talking to a friend or family member on the screen. His gaze is focused and gentle, with a natural smile. The background is his carefully decorated personal space, with photos and a world map on the wall, conveying a sense of intimate and modern communication." \
    --ip_image "test/input/lecun.jpg" \
    --output "test/output/lecun.mp4"
```

**Prompting:** Use *"a man"* or *"a woman"* to avoid altering facial features. Prompts support both English and Chinese. Use for frontal, medium-to-close-up videos.
**Input Image:** Use a high-resolution frontal face image for the best results. Our built-in pipeline handles different resolutions/formats.

### Inference with Community LoRA

Load LoRA models alongside Stand-In using `infer_with_lora.py`:

```bash
python infer_with_lora.py \
    --prompt "A man sits comfortably at a desk, facing the camera as if talking to a friend or family member on the screen. His gaze is focused and gentle, with a natural smile. The background is his carefully decorated personal space, with photos and a world map on the wall, conveying a sense of intimate and modern communication." \
    --ip_image "test/input/lecun.jpg" \
    --output "test/output/lecun.mp4" \
    --lora_path "path/to/your/lora.safetensors" \
    --lora_scale 1.0
```

Recommended stylization LoRA:  [https://civitai.com/models/1404755/studio-ghibli-wan21-t2v-14b](https://civitai.com/models/1404755/studio-ghibli-wan21-t2v-14b)

### Video Face Swapping

Perform face swapping with the experimental `infer_face_swap.py`:

```bash
python infer_face_swap.py \
    --prompt "The video features a woman standing in front of a large screen displaying the words ""Tech Minute"" and the logo for CNET. She is wearing a purple top and appears to be presenting or speaking about technology-related topics. The background includes a cityscape with tall buildings, suggesting an urban setting. The woman seems to be engaged in a discussion or providing information on technology news or trends. The overall atmosphere is professional and informative, likely aimed at educating viewers about the latest developments in the tech industry." \
    --ip_image "test/input/ruonan.jpg" \
    --output "test/output/ruonan.mp4" \
    --denoising_strength 0.85
```

**Note:** This feature is experimental.
Adjust `--denoising_strength` for background and face blending.  Use `--force_background_consistency` cautiously, as it may cause contour issues.

### Infer with VACE

Generate videos with VACE and Stand-In via `infer_with_vace.py`:

```bash
python infer_with_vace.py \
    --prompt "A woman raises her hands." \
    --vace_path "checkpoints/VACE/" \
    --ip_image "test/input/first_frame.png" \
    --reference_video "test/input/pose.mp4" \
    --reference_image "test/input/first_frame.png" \
    --output "test/output/woman.mp4" \
    --vace_scale 0.8
```

You need to download the corresponding weights from the `VACE` repository or provide the path to the `VACE` weights in the `vace_path` parameter.

VACE's control has a preset bias towards faces, which affects identity preservation. Please lower the `vace_scale` to a balance point where both motion and identity are preserved. When only `ip_image` and `reference_video` are provided, the weight can be reduced to 0.5.

Using both Stand-In and VACE together is more challenging than using Stand-In alone. We are still maintaining this feature, so if you encounter unexpected outputs or have other questions, feel free to raise them in the issue.
