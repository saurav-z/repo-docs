## Quick Start: Get Started Easily

### 1.  Set Up Your Environment

   *   **Clone the repository:** `git clone https://github.com/WeChatCV/Stand-In.git`
   *   **Navigate:** `cd Stand-In`
   *   **Create and activate a Conda environment:**  `conda create -n Stand-In python=3.11 -y` and `conda activate Stand-In`
   *   **Install dependencies:** `pip install -r requirements.txt`
   *   **(Optional) Install Flash Attention:** `pip install flash-attn --no-build-isolation` (ensure GPU/CUDA compatibility)

### 2.  Download the Necessary Models

   *   Run the automatic download script: `python download_models.py`
   *   This downloads `wan2.1-T2V-14B`, `antelopev2`, and `Stand-In`.
   *   **(Alternative)** If you have the base model, modify `download_model.py` and place the model in `checkpoints/wan2.1-T2V-14B`.

## Usage Instructions

### Standard Inference
```bash
python infer.py \
    --prompt "A man sits comfortably at a desk, facing the camera as if talking to a friend or family member on the screen. His gaze is focused and gentle, with a natural smile. The background is his carefully decorated personal space, with photos and a world map on the wall, conveying a sense of intimate and modern communication." \
    --ip_image "test/input/lecun.jpg" \
    --output "test/output/lecun.mp4"
```
**Prompt Tip:** Use "a man" or "a woman" for consistent facial features. Supports Chinese and English prompts; designed for frontal, medium-to-close-up videos.

**Input Image:** Recommended high-resolution frontal face image.  The preprocessing pipeline handles resolution and file extensions.

### Inference with Community LoRA

```bash
python infer_with_lora.py \
    --prompt "A man sits comfortably at a desk, facing the camera as if talking to a friend or family member on the screen. His gaze is focused and gentle, with a natural smile. The background is his carefully decorated personal space, with photos and a world map on the wall, conveying a sense of intimate and modern communication." \
    --ip_image "test/input/lecun.jpg" \
    --output "test/output/lecun.mp4" \
    --lora_path "path/to/your/lora.safetensors" \
    --lora_scale 1.0
```

**Example LoRA:**  [https://civitai.com/models/1404755/studio-ghibli-wan21-t2v-14b](https://civitai.com/models/1404755/studio-ghibli-wan21-t2v-14b)

### Video Face Swapping
```bash
python infer_face_swap.py \
    --prompt "The video features a woman standing in front of a large screen displaying the words ""Tech Minute"" and the logo for CNET. She is wearing a purple top and appears to be presenting or speaking about technology-related topics. The background includes a cityscape with tall buildings, suggesting an urban setting. The woman seems to be engaged in a discussion or providing information on technology news or trends. The overall atmosphere is professional and informative, likely aimed at educating viewers about the latest developments in the tech industry." \
    --ip_image "test/input/ruonan.jpg" \
    --output "test/output/ruonan.mp4" \
    --denoising_strength 0.85
```
**Note:** Face swapping is experimental. Adjust `--denoising_strength` for optimal balance between background redraw and face naturalness. Use `--force_background_consistency` cautiously, as it can create contour issues.

---

### Infer with VACE
```bash
python infer_with_vace.py \
    --prompt "A woman raises her hands." \
    --vace_path "checkpoints/VACE/" \
    --ip_image "test/input/first_frame.png" \
    --reference_video "test/input/pose.mp4" \
    --reference_image "test/input/first_frame.png" \
    --output "test/output/woman.mp4" \
    --vace_scale 0.8
```
**Prerequisites:** Download VACE weights and pre-process control video with the VACE tool. Both `reference_video` and `reference_image` are optional. Adjust `vace_scale` for motion/identity balance. Reduce the weight to 0.5 when only `ip_image` and `reference_video` are provided.
