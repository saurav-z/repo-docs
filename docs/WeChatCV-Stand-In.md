## Quick Start

### 1. Environment Setup

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/WeChatCV/Stand-In.git
cd Stand-In

# Create and activate the Conda environment
conda create -n Stand-In python=3.11 -y
conda activate Stand-In

# Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt

# (Optional) Install Flash Attention for faster inference
# Note: Ensure GPU and CUDA version compatibility.
pip install flash-attn --no-build-isolation
```

### 2. Model Download

Use the provided script to automatically download required model weights.

```bash
python download_models.py
```

This downloads:
*   `wan2.1-T2V-14B` (base T2V model)
*   `antelopev2` (face recognition)
*   `Stand-In` (the Stand-In model)

> **Note:**  If you have `wan2.1-T2V-14B` locally, modify `download_model.py` to skip the download and place the model in the `checkpoints/wan2.1-T2V-14B` directory.

## Usage

### Standard Inference

Generate identity-preserving videos using `infer.py`:

```bash
python infer.py \
    --prompt "A man sits comfortably at a desk, facing the camera as if talking to a friend or family member on the screen. His gaze is focused and gentle, with a natural smile. The background is his carefully decorated personal space, with photos and a world map on the wall, conveying a sense of intimate and modern communication." \
    --ip_image "test/input/lecun.jpg" \
    --output "test/output/lecun.mp4"
```

**Prompt Tips:** Use *"a man"* or *"a woman"* to avoid altering facial features. Prompts support both Chinese and English. Designed for frontal, medium-to-close-up videos.

**Input Image:**  High-resolution, frontal face images are recommended. The built-in preprocessing handles resolution and file extensions.

### Inference with Community LoRA

Load community LoRA models with `infer_with_lora.py`:

```bash
python infer_with_lora.py \
    --prompt "A man sits comfortably at a desk, facing the camera as if talking to a friend or family member on the screen. His gaze is focused and gentle, with a natural smile. The background is his carefully decorated personal space, with photos and a world map on the wall, conveying a sense of intimate and modern communication." \
    --ip_image "test/input/lecun.jpg" \
    --output "test/output/lecun.mp4" \
    --lora_path "path/to/your/lora.safetensors" \
    --lora_scale 1.0
```

### Video Face Swapping (Experimental)

Perform face swapping with `infer_face_swap.py`:

```bash
python infer_face_swap.py \
    --prompt "The video features a woman standing in front of a large screen displaying the words ""Tech Minute"" and the logo for CNET. She is wearing a purple top and appears to be presenting or speaking about technology-related topics. The background includes a cityscape with tall buildings, suggesting an urban setting. The woman seems to be engaged in a discussion or providing information on technology news or trends. The overall atmosphere is professional and informative, likely aimed at educating viewers about the latest developments in the tech industry." \
    --ip_image "test/input/ruonan.jpg" \
    --output "test/output/ruonan.mp4" \
    --denoising_strength 0.85
```

**Note:**  Face swapping is experimental due to limitations in Wan2.1's inpainting capabilities.

Adjust `denoising_strength` for background and face area control. High values redraw the background more, while low values lead to potential overfitting in the face. `force_background_consistency` can be used for background consistency, but may introduce contour issues.

### Infer with VACE

Generate videos using Stand-In, compatible with VACE:

```bash
python infer_with_vace.py \
    --prompt "A woman raises her hands." \
    --vace_path "checkpoints/VACE/" \
    --ip_image "test/input/first_frame.png" \
    --reference_video "test/input/pose.mp4" \
    --reference_image "test/input/first_frame.png" \
    --output "test/output/woman.mp4" \
    --vace_scale 0.8
```

Download the VACE weights from the VACE repository or provide the path to the `vace_path` parameter.

```bash
python download_models.py --vace
```

Preprocess the control video using VACE's preprocessing tool. Both `reference_video` and `reference_image` are optional. Adjust the `vace_scale` to balance motion and identity preservation.  If only `ip_image` and `reference_video` are used, the weight can be reduced to 0.5.
