## Getting Started: Quick Setup Guide

### 1.  Environment Setup:

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/WeChatCV/Stand-In.git
cd Stand-In

# Create and activate a Conda environment
conda create -n Stand-In python=3.11 -y
conda activate Stand-In

# Install required packages
pip install -r requirements.txt

# (Optional) Install Flash Attention for faster inference
pip install flash-attn --no-build-isolation
```

### 2.  Model Download:

Download all necessary models using the provided script:

```bash
python download_models.py
```

This script downloads:

*   `wan2.1-T2V-14B` (base model)
*   `antelopev2` (face recognition)
*   `Stand-In` (the Stand-In model)

> **Important:** If you have `wan2.1-T2V-14B` already, you can modify `download_model.py` to skip its download and place the model in the `checkpoints/wan2.1-T2V-14B` directory.

---

## Usage: Core Scripts

### Standard Inference

Use the `infer.py` script:

```bash
python infer.py \
    --prompt "A man sits comfortably at a desk, facing the camera as if talking to a friend or family member on the screen. His gaze is focused and gentle, with a natural smile. The background is his carefully decorated personal space, with photos and a world map on the wall, conveying a sense of intimate and modern communication." \
    --ip_image "test/input/lecun.jpg" \
    --output "test/output/lecun.mp4"
```

**Prompting Tips:** Use *"a man"* or *"a woman"* to avoid modifying facial features. The prompt is meant for frontal, medium-to-close-up videos.

**Input Recommendations:** Use a high-resolution frontal face image. Our preprocessing pipeline handles various resolutions and file types.

### Inference with Community LoRA

Use the `infer_with_lora.py` script:

```bash
python infer_with_lora.py \
    --prompt "A man sits comfortably at a desk, facing the camera as if talking to a friend or family member on the screen. His gaze is focused and gentle, with a natural smile. The background is his carefully decorated personal space, with photos and a world map on the wall, conveying a sense of intimate and modern communication." \
    --ip_image "test/input/lecun.jpg" \
    --output "test/output/lecun.mp4" \
    --lora_path "path/to/your/lora.safetensors" \
    --lora_scale 1.0
```

**Example LoRA:**  [https://civitai.com/models/1404755/studio-ghibli-wan21-t2v-14b](https://civitai.com/models/1404755/studio-ghibli-wan21-t2v-14b)

---

### Video Face Swapping (Experimental)

Use the `infer_face_swap.py` script:

```bash
python infer_face_swap.py \
    --prompt "The video features a woman standing in front of a large screen displaying the words ""Tech Minute"" and the logo for CNET. She is wearing a purple top and appears to be presenting or speaking about technology-related topics. The background includes a cityscape with tall buildings, suggesting an urban setting. The woman seems to be engaged in a discussion or providing information on technology news or trends. The overall atmosphere is professional and informative, likely aimed at educating viewers about the latest developments in the tech industry." \
    --ip_image "test/input/ruonan.jpg" \
    --output "test/output/ruonan.mp4" \
    --denoising_strength 0.85
```

**Important Note:**  Face swapping is experimental. Adjust `denoising_strength` for optimal results. Use `--force_background_consistency` cautiously.

---

### Inference with VACE

Use the `infer_with_vace.py` script:

```bash
python infer_with_vace.py \
    --prompt "A woman raises her hands." \
    --vace_path "checkpoints/VACE/" \
    --ip_image "test/input/first_frame.png" \
    --reference_video "test/input/pose.mp4" \
    --reference_image "test/input/first_frame.png" \
    --output "test/output/woman.mp4" \
    --vace_scale 0.8
```

**Prerequisites:** Download VACE weights and preprocess the control video using VACE's preprocessing tool. Adjust `vace_scale` for balance between motion and identity.
