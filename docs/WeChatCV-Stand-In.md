## Overview

**Stand-In** is a cutting-edge framework designed for **identity-preserving video generation**, offering a streamlined, plug-and-play solution.  By training only a fraction of the parameters (approximately 1%) of the base video generation model, Stand-In achieves state-of-the-art results in both face similarity and naturalness, surpassing methods that require full-parameter training. It seamlessly integrates into various video generation tasks, including subject-driven, pose-controlled, and stylized video creation, as well as face swapping.

## Key Features

*   âœ… **Efficient Training:** Requires training only 1% of the base model parameters.
*   âœ… **High Fidelity:** Achieves outstanding identity consistency while maintaining video generation quality.
*   âœ… **Plug-and-Play Integration:** Easily integrates into existing Text-to-Video (T2V) models.
*   âœ… **Extensible:** Compatible with community models (e.g., LoRA) and supports a wide range of downstream video tasks.

## What's New

*   **[2025.08.18]** Released VACE compatibility, enabling simultaneous pose control and identity preservation.
*   **[2025.08.16]** Updated experimental face swapping feature.
*   **[2025.08.13]** Official Stand-In preprocessing ComfyUI node released:  [https://github.com/WeChatCV/Stand-In_Preprocessor_ComfyUI](https://github.com/WeChatCV/Stand-In_Preprocessor_ComfyUI)
*   **[2025.08.12]**  Stand-In v1.0 (153M parameters) released, with open-sourced Wan2.1-14B-T2V-adapted weights and inference code.

## Getting Started

### 1. Environment Setup
```bash
# Clone the project repository
git clone https://github.com/WeChatCV/Stand-In.git
cd Stand-In

# Create and activate Conda environment
conda create -n Stand-In python=3.11 -y
conda activate Stand-In

# Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt

# (Optional) Install Flash Attention for faster inference
# Note: Make sure your GPU and CUDA version are compatible with Flash Attention
pip install flash-attn --no-build-isolation
```

### 2. Model Download
Use the provided script to automatically download the required models:
```bash
python download_models.py
```
This script will download:

*   `wan2.1-T2V-14B` (base text-to-video model)
*   `antelopev2` (face recognition model)
*   `Stand-In` (Stand-In model)

> **Note:** If you have the `wan2.1-T2V-14B` model locally, modify the `download_model.py` script to comment out the download code and place your model in the `checkpoints/wan2.1-T2V-14B` directory.

## Usage

### Standard Inference

Run `infer.py` for identity-preserving text-to-video generation.

```bash
python infer.py \
    --prompt "A man sits comfortably at a desk, facing the camera as if talking to a friend or family member on the screen. His gaze is focused and gentle, with a natural smile. The background is his carefully decorated personal space, with photos and a world map on the wall, conveying a sense of intimate and modern communication." \
    --ip_image "test/input/lecun.jpg" \
    --output "test/output/lecun.mp4"
```

**Prompting Tips:**  To avoid altering facial features, use prompts like "a man" or "a woman."  Prompts support both Chinese and English. Designed for frontal, medium-to-close-up videos.

**Input Image Recommendations:**  Use high-resolution, frontal face images for optimal results. The built-in preprocessing pipeline handles resolution and file extensions.

### Inference with Community LoRA

Load community LoRA models with `infer_with_lora.py`:

```bash
python infer_with_lora.py \
    --prompt "A man sits comfortably at a desk, facing the camera as if talking to a friend or family member on the screen. His gaze is focused and gentle, with a natural smile. The background is his carefully decorated personal space, with photos and a world map on the wall, conveying a sense of intimate and modern communication." \
    --ip_image "test/input/lecun.jpg" \
    --output "test/output/lecun.mp4" \
    --lora_path "path/to/your/lora.safetensors" \
    --lora_scale 1.0
```

We recommend this stylization LoRA: [https://civitai.com/models/1404755/studio-ghibli-wan21-t2v-14b](https://civitai.com/models/1404755/studio-ghibli-wan21-t2v-14b)

### Video Face Swapping

Use `infer_face_swap.py` for video face swapping:

```bash
python infer_face_swap.py \
    --prompt "The video features a woman standing in front of a large screen displaying the words ""Tech Minute"" and the logo for CNET. She is wearing a purple top and appears to be presenting or speaking about technology-related topics. The background includes a cityscape with tall buildings, suggesting an urban setting. The woman seems to be engaged in a discussion or providing information on technology news or trends. The overall atmosphere is professional and informative, likely aimed at educating viewers about the latest developments in the tech industry." \
    --ip_image "test/input/ruonan.jpg" \
    --output "test/output/ruonan.mp4" \
    --denoising_strength 0.85
```

**Note:**  Face swapping is experimental due to the lack of inpainting in Wan2.1.

Adjust `denoising_strength` to balance background redrawing and face naturalness.  For complete background consistency, enable `--force_background_consistency` and experiment with `denoising_strength` to mitigate potential contour issues.

### Infer with VACE

Use `infer_with_vace.py` for identity-preserving video generation with VACE:

```bash
python infer_with_vace.py \
    --prompt "A woman raises her hands." \
    --vace_path "checkpoints/VACE/" \
    --ip_image "test/input/first_frame.png" \
    --reference_video "test/input/pose.mp4" \
    --reference_image "test/input/first_frame.png" \
    --output "test/output/woman.mp4" \
    --vace_scale 0.8
```

Download VACE weights from the VACE repository or specify their path in the `vace_path` parameter.

```bash
python download_models.py --vace
```

Preprocess the input control video using VACE's preprocessing tool. Adjust `vace_scale` to balance motion and identity preservation.  Reduce the weight to 0.5 when only `ip_image` and `reference_video` are provided.  For any issues, please raise them in the issue tracker.
