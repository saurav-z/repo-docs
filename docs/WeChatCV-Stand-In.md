**Stand-In** is a revolutionary framework that allows you to generate high-quality videos while preserving the identity of your subject.  By training only **1%** additional parameters, Stand-In delivers state-of-the-art results in both Face Similarity and Naturalness, outperforming methods requiring full-parameter training. [Explore the Stand-In repository for more details.](https://github.com/WeChatCV/Stand-In)

## Quick Start

### 1. Environment Setup

```bash
# Clone the project repository
git clone https://github.com/WeChatCV/Stand-In.git
cd Stand-In

# Create and activate Conda environment
conda create -n Stand-In python=3.11 -y
conda activate Stand-In

# Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt

# (Optional) Install Flash Attention for faster inference
# Note: Make sure your GPU and CUDA version are compatible with Flash Attention
pip install flash-attn --no-build-isolation
```

### 2. Model Download

```bash
python download_models.py
```

The script downloads the necessary models: `wan2.1-T2V-14B`, `antelopev2`, and the `Stand-In` model weights.  If you have the `wan2.1-T2V-14B` model already, you can modify `download_model.py` to skip the download.

## Usage

### Standard Inference

```bash
python infer.py \
    --prompt "A man sits comfortably at a desk, facing the camera as if talking to a friend or family member on the screen. His gaze is focused and gentle, with a natural smile. The background is his carefully decorated personal space, with photos and a world map on the wall, conveying a sense of intimate and modern communication." \
    --ip_image "test/input/lecun.jpg" \
    --output "test/output/lecun.mp4"
```

**Prompting Tip:** Use *"a man"* or *"a woman"* without adding facial descriptions for unchanged appearance.  Prompts support Chinese and English. The prompt is optimized for frontal, medium-to-close-up shots.

**Input Recommendation:** Use a high-resolution frontal face image. The built-in pipeline handles image format and resolution.

### Inference with Community LoRA

```bash
python infer_with_lora.py \
    --prompt "A man sits comfortably at a desk, facing the camera as if talking to a friend or family member on the screen. His gaze is focused and gentle, with a natural smile. The background is his carefully decorated personal space, with photos and a world map on the wall, conveying a sense of intimate and modern communication." \
    --ip_image "test/input/lecun.jpg" \
    --output "test/output/lecun.mp4" \
    --lora_path "path/to/your/lora.safetensors" \
    --lora_scale 1.0
```

### Video Face Swapping (Experimental)

```bash
python infer_face_swap.py \
    --prompt "The video features a woman standing in front of a large screen displaying the words ""Tech Minute"" and the logo for CNET. She is wearing a purple top and appears to be presenting or speaking about technology-related topics. The background includes a cityscape with tall buildings, suggesting an urban setting. The woman seems to be engaged in a discussion or providing information on technology news or trends. The overall atmosphere is professional and informative, likely aimed at educating viewers about the latest developments in the tech industry." \
    --ip_image "test/input/ruonan.jpg" \
    --output "test/output/ruonan.mp4" \
    --denoising_strength 0.85
```

**Note:**  Face swapping is experimental. Adjust `denoising_strength` for best results.  Use `--force_background_consistency` cautiously.

---

### Infer with VACE

```bash
python infer_with_vace.py \
    --prompt "A woman raises her hands." \
    --vace_path "checkpoints/VACE/" \
    --ip_image "test/input/first_frame.png" \
    --reference_video "test/input/pose.mp4" \
    --reference_image "test/input/first_frame.png" \
    --output "test/output/woman.mp4" \
    --vace_scale 0.8
```

Download VACE weights and preprocess the control video.  Adjust `vace_scale` for balance between motion and identity preservation.
