## **Getting Started: Quick Start Guide**

Follow these steps to get Stand-In up and running:

### 1.  Environment Setup

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/WeChatCV/Stand-In.git
cd Stand-In

# Create and activate a Conda environment
conda create -n Stand-In python=3.11 -y
conda activate Stand-In

# Install required packages
pip install -r requirements.txt

# (Optional) Install Flash Attention for faster inference (ensure compatibility)
pip install flash-attn --no-build-isolation
```

### 2. Model Download
Easily download all necessary model weights using our automated script.

```bash
python download_models.py
```

This script will download the following models:
* `wan2.1-T2V-14B` (base text-to-video model)
* `antelopev2` (face recognition model)
* `Stand-In` (our Stand-In model)

> **Note:** If you already have the `wan2.1-T2V-14B` model, modify the `download_model.py` script to prevent redownloading and place the model in the specified `checkpoints` directory.

## **Usage:  Generating Videos with Stand-In**

### **Standard Inference**

Run the `infer.py` script for identity-preserving text-to-video generation.

```bash
python infer.py \
    --prompt "A man sits comfortably at a desk, facing the camera as if talking to a friend or family member on the screen. His gaze is focused and gentle, with a natural smile. The background is his carefully decorated personal space, with photos and a world map on the wall, conveying a sense of intimate and modern communication." \
    --ip_image "test/input/lecun.jpg" \
    --output "test/output/lecun.mp4"
```

**Prompting Tips:**  Use *"a man"* or *"a woman"* for simple appearance descriptions. Prompts can be in Chinese or English, and are optimized for frontal, medium-to-close-up videos.

**Input Image Best Practices:**  Use a high-resolution, frontal face image for the best results. Our built-in preprocessing handles various resolutions and file types.

### **Inference with Community LoRA**

Load and use community LoRA models alongside Stand-In with the `infer_with_lora.py` script.

```bash
python infer_with_lora.py \
    --prompt "A man sits comfortably at a desk, facing the camera as if talking to a friend or family member on the screen. His gaze is focused and gentle, with a natural smile. The background is his carefully decorated personal space, with photos and a world map on the wall, conveying a sense of intimate and modern communication." \
    --ip_image "test/input/lecun.jpg" \
    --output "test/output/lecun.mp4" \
    --lora_path "path/to/your/lora.safetensors" \
    --lora_scale 1.0
```

---

### **Video Face Swapping (Experimental)**

Utilize the `infer_face_swap.py` script for video face swapping.

```bash
python infer_face_swap.py \
    --prompt "The video features a woman standing in front of a large screen displaying the words ""Tech Minute"" and the logo for CNET. She is wearing a purple top and appears to be presenting or speaking about technology-related topics. The background includes a cityscape with tall buildings, suggesting an urban setting. The woman seems to be engaged in a discussion or providing information on technology news or trends. The overall atmosphere is professional and informative, likely aimed at educating viewers about the latest developments in the tech industry." \
    --ip_image "test/input/ruonan.jpg" \
    --output "test/output/ruonan.mp4" \
    --denoising_strength 0.85
```

**Important Notes:**  Face swapping is experimental. Adjust `denoising_strength` for optimal results.  Higher values redraw more background and can yield a more natural face.  `--force_background_consistency` maintains background consistency but may cause contour issues.

---

### **Infer with VACE**

Generate videos using Stand-In with VACE for advanced control.

```bash
python infer_with_vace.py \
    --prompt "A woman raises her hands." \
    --vace_path "checkpoints/VACE/" \
    --ip_image "test/input/first_frame.png" \
    --reference_video "test/input/pose.mp4" \
    --reference_image "test/input/first_frame.png" \
    --output "test/output/woman.mp4" \
    --vace_scale 0.8
```

*   Download VACE weights from the VACE repository and provide the path.
*   Preprocess the input control video using VACE's preprocessing tool.
*   Adjust `vace_scale` to balance motion and identity preservation.
