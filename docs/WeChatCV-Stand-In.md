## üöÄ Quick Start: Get Started with Stand-In

### 1. Environment Setup

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/WeChatCV/Stand-In.git
cd Stand-In

# Create and activate a Conda environment
conda create -n Stand-In python=3.11 -y
conda activate Stand-In

# Install required packages
pip install -r requirements.txt

# (Optional) Install Flash Attention for enhanced performance
pip install flash-attn --no-build-isolation
```

### 2. Model Download

An automatic download script is provided to fetch all necessary model weights into the `checkpoints` directory.

```bash
python download_models.py
```

This script will download the following models:

*   `wan2.1-T2V-14B` (base text-to-video model)
*   `antelopev2` (face recognition model)
*   `Stand-In` (Stand-In model)

>   **Note:** If you have the `wan2.1-T2V-14B` model locally, adjust the `download_models.py` script by commenting out the download code and place the model in the `checkpoints/wan2.1-T2V-14B` directory.

## üß™ Usage: Run Your First Video

### Standard Inference

Generate identity-preserving videos from text prompts using the `infer.py` script:

```bash
python infer.py \
    --prompt "A man sits comfortably at a desk, facing the camera as if talking to a friend or family member on the screen. His gaze is focused and gentle, with a natural smile. The background is his carefully decorated personal space, with photos and a world map on the wall, conveying a sense of intimate and modern communication." \
    --ip_image "test/input/lecun.jpg" \
    --output "test/output/lecun.mp4"
```

**Prompting Tip:** For consistent facial features, avoid adding extra appearance descriptions. Prompts support both Chinese and English. Focus on frontal, medium-to-close-up shots.

**Input Image Recommendation:** Use a high-resolution frontal face image for optimal results. Our preprocessing pipeline handles various resolutions and file formats.

### Inference with Community LoRA

Combine Stand-In with community LoRA models for stylized video generation.

```bash
python infer_with_lora.py \
    --prompt "A man sits comfortably at a desk, facing the camera as if talking to a friend or family member on the screen. His gaze is focused and gentle, with a natural smile. The background is his carefully decorated personal space, with photos and a world map on the wall, conveying a sense of intimate and modern communication." \
    --ip_image "test/input/lecun.jpg" \
    --output "test/output/lecun.mp4" \
    --lora_path "path/to/your/lora.safetensors" \
    --lora_scale 1.0
```

### Video Face Swapping (Experimental)

Perform face swapping using the `infer_face_swap.py` script.  **Note:** This feature is experimental.

```bash
python infer_face_swap.py \
    --prompt "The video features a woman standing in front of a large screen displaying the words ""Tech Minute"" and the logo for CNET. She is wearing a purple top and appears to be presenting or speaking about technology-related topics. The background includes a cityscape with tall buildings, suggesting an urban setting. The woman seems to be engaged in a discussion or providing information on technology news or trends. The overall atmosphere is professional and informative, likely aimed at educating viewers about the latest developments in the tech industry." \
    --ip_image "test/input/ruonan.jpg" \
    --output "test/output/ruonan.mp4" \
    --denoising_strength 0.85
```

Adjust `denoising_strength` to control the redrawing of the background and face consistency. Higher values redraw more of the background and can improve face realism. Lower values maintain background details but may result in face overfitting.

Set `--force_background_consistency` cautiously, as it may cause contour issues. Experiment with `denoising_strength` to achieve the best results.

### Infer with VACE

Use the `infer_with_vace.py` script to perform identity-preserving video generation with Stand-In, compatible with VACE.

```bash
python infer_with_vace.py \
    --prompt "A woman raises her hands." \
    --vace_path "checkpoints/VACE/" \
    --ip_image "test/input/first_frame.png" \
    --reference_video "test/input/pose.mp4" \
    --reference_image "test/input/first_frame.png" \
    --output "test/output/woman.mp4" \
    --vace_scale 0.8
```
You need to download the corresponding weights from the `VACE` repository or provide the path to the `VACE` weights in the `vace_path` parameter.

The input control video needs to be preprocessed using VACE's preprocessing tool. Both `reference_video` and `reference_image` are optional and can exist simultaneously. Additionally, VACE‚Äôs control has a preset bias towards faces, which affects identity preservation. Please lower the `vace_scale` to a balance point where both motion and identity are preserved. When only `ip_image` and `reference_video` are provided, the weight can be reduced to 0.5.

Using both Stand-In and VACE together is more challenging than using Stand-In alone. We are still maintaining this feature, so if you encounter unexpected outputs or have other questions, feel free to raise them in the issue.
