## Quick Start

### 1. Environment Setup

```bash
# Clone the project repository
git clone https://github.com/WeChatCV/Stand-In.git
cd Stand-In

# Create and activate Conda environment
conda create -n Stand-In python=3.11 -y
conda activate Stand-In

# Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt

# (Optional) Install Flash Attention for faster inference
# Note: Make sure your GPU and CUDA version are compatible with Flash Attention
pip install flash-attn --no-build-isolation
```

### 2. Model Download

Download the required models automatically using the provided script:

```bash
python download_models.py
```

This script downloads:

*   `wan2.1-T2V-14B` (base model)
*   `antelopev2` (face recognition model)
*   `Stand-In` (our Stand-In model)

> **Note:** If you already have the base model, modify `download_model.py` to skip the download and place the model in the appropriate directory.

## Usage

### Standard Inference

Generate videos using the `infer.py` script.

```bash
python infer.py \
    --prompt "A man sits comfortably at a desk, facing the camera as if talking to a friend or family member on the screen. His gaze is focused and gentle, with a natural smile. The background is his carefully decorated personal space, with photos and a world map on the wall, conveying a sense of intimate and modern communication." \
    --ip_image "test/input/lecun.jpg" \
    --output "test/output/lecun.mp4"
```

**Prompt Tip:** For consistent facial features, use simple prompts like *"a man"* or *"a woman"*. Prompts support both Chinese and English and are optimized for frontal, medium-to-close-up shots.

**Input Image Recommendation:** Use a high-resolution, frontal face image for the best results.

### Inference with Community LoRA

Combine Stand-In with community LoRA models using `infer_with_lora.py`.

```bash
python infer_with_lora.py \
    --prompt "A man sits comfortably at a desk, facing the camera as if talking to a friend or family member on the screen. His gaze is focused and gentle, with a natural smile. The background is his carefully decorated personal space, with photos and a world map on the wall, conveying a sense of intimate and modern communication." \
    --ip_image "test/input/lecun.jpg" \
    --output "test/output/lecun.mp4" \
    --lora_path "path/to/your/lora.safetensors" \
    --lora_scale 1.0
```

**Recommended LoRA:** [https://civitai.com/models/1404755/studio-ghibli-wan21-t2v-14b](https://civitai.com/models/1404755/studio-ghibli-wan21-t2v-14b)

### Video Face Swapping

Experiment with face swapping using the `infer_face_swap.py` script.

```bash
python infer_face_swap.py \
    --prompt "The video features a woman standing in front of a large screen displaying the words ""Tech Minute"" and the logo for CNET. She is wearing a purple top and appears to be presenting or speaking about technology-related topics. The background includes a cityscape with tall buildings, suggesting an urban setting. The woman seems to be engaged in a discussion or providing information on technology news or trends. The overall atmosphere is professional and informative, likely aimed at educating viewers about the latest developments in the tech industry." \
    --ip_image "test/input/ruonan.jpg" \
    --output "test/output/ruonan.mp4" \
    --denoising_strength 0.85
```

**Note:** Face swapping is experimental. Adjust `--denoising_strength` for optimal results: higher values redraw the background more, while lower values increase face overfitting. Consider `--force_background_consistency` with caution.

### Infer with VACE
Use the `infer_with_vace.py` script to perform identity-preserving video generation with Stand-In, compatible with VACE.
```bash
python infer_with_vace.py \
    --prompt "A woman raises her hands." \
    --vace_path "checkpoints/VACE/" \
    --ip_image "test/input/first_frame.png" \
    --reference_video "test/input/pose.mp4" \
    --reference_image "test/input/first_frame.png" \
    --output "test/output/woman.mp4" \
    --vace_scale 0.8
```
You need to download the corresponding weights from the `VACE` repository or provide the path to the `VACE` weights in the `vace_path` parameter.

The input control video needs to be preprocessed using VACE's preprocessing tool. Both `reference_video` and `reference_image` are optional and can exist simultaneously. Additionally, VACEâ€™s control has a preset bias towards faces, which affects identity preservation. Please lower the `vace_scale` to a balance point where both motion and identity are preserved. When only `ip_image` and `reference_video` are provided, the weight can be reduced to 0.5.

Using both Stand-In and VACE together is more challenging than using Stand-In alone. We are still maintaining this feature, so if you encounter unexpected outputs or have other questions, feel free to raise them in the issue.
