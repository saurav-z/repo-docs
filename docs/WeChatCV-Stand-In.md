## Getting Started

### 1.  Environment Setup

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/WeChatCV/Stand-In.git
cd Stand-In

# Create and activate a Conda environment
conda create -n Stand-In python=3.11 -y
conda activate Stand-In

# Install the necessary dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Optional: Install Flash Attention for faster inference (check compatibility)
pip install flash-attn --no-build-isolation
```

### 2. Model Download

Download the required models automatically with the following script:

```bash
python download_models.py
```

This script downloads:

*   `wan2.1-T2V-14B` (base text-to-video model)
*   `antelopev2` (face recognition model)
*   `Stand-In` (our Stand-In model)

>   **Note:** If you already have the `wan2.1-T2V-14B` model, modify the `download_model.py` script to avoid redownloading it. Place the model in `checkpoints/wan2.1-T2V-14B`.

## Usage

### Standard Inference

Generate identity-preserving videos using the `infer.py` script.

```bash
python infer.py \
    --prompt "A man sits comfortably at a desk, facing the camera as if talking to a friend or family member on the screen. His gaze is focused and gentle, with a natural smile. The background is his carefully decorated personal space, with photos and a world map on the wall, conveying a sense of intimate and modern communication." \
    --ip_image "test/input/lecun.jpg" \
    --output "test/output/lecun.mp4"
```

**Prompt Tip:**  To avoid altering facial features, use prompts like *"a man"* or *"a woman"* without specifying appearance.  Frontal, medium-to-close-up videos are best.

**Input Image:** High-resolution, frontal face images are recommended. The built-in preprocessing pipeline will handle different resolutions and formats.

### Inference with Community LoRA

Load and combine LoRA models with Stand-In using the `infer_with_lora.py` script.

```bash
python infer_with_lora.py \
    --prompt "A man sits comfortably at a desk, facing the camera as if talking to a friend or family member on the screen. His gaze is focused and gentle, with a natural smile. The background is his carefully decorated personal space, with photos and a world map on the wall, conveying a sense of intimate and modern communication." \
    --ip_image "test/input/lecun.jpg" \
    --output "test/output/lecun.mp4" \
    --lora_path "path/to/your/lora.safetensors" \
    --lora_scale 1.0
```

Recommended stylization LoRA: [https://civitai.com/models/1404755/studio-ghibli-wan21-t2v-14b](https://civitai.com/models/1404755/studio-ghibli-wan21-t2v-14b)

---

### Video Face Swapping

Use the `infer_face_swap.py` script for experimental video face swapping.

```bash
python infer_face_swap.py \
    --prompt "The video features a woman standing in front of a large screen displaying the words ""Tech Minute"" and the logo for CNET. She is wearing a purple top and appears to be presenting or speaking about technology-related topics. The background includes a cityscape with tall buildings, suggesting an urban setting. The woman seems to be engaged in a discussion or providing information on technology news or trends. The overall atmosphere is professional and informative, likely aimed at educating viewers about the latest developments in the tech industry." \
    --ip_image "test/input/ruonan.jpg" \
    --output "test/output/ruonan.mp4" \
    --denoising_strength 0.85
```

**Note:**  Face swapping is experimental due to the lack of inpainting in Wan2.1. Experiment with `--denoising_strength` to balance background and face consistency.

### Infer with VACE (Pose-Guided Generation)

Combine Stand-In with VACE for pose-guided video generation using the `infer_with_vace.py` script.

```bash
python infer_with_vace.py \
    --prompt "A woman raises her hands." \
    --vace_path "checkpoints/VACE/" \
    --ip_image "test/input/first_frame.png" \
    --reference_video "test/input/pose.mp4" \
    --reference_image "test/input/first_frame.png" \
    --output "test/output/woman.mp4" \
    --vace_scale 0.8
```

You must download the VACE weights from the [VACE repository](<https://github.com/your-vace-repo>) or provide the `vace_path` parameter.

```bash
python download_models.py --vace
```

Preprocess the input control video using VACE's tool. Adjust `vace_scale` for a balance between motion and identity preservation. When only `ip_image` and `reference_video` are used, reducing the weight to 0.5 is effective.
