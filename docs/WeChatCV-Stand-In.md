**Stand-In** is a groundbreaking framework for identity-preserving video generation.  This innovative approach preserves the identity of subjects in generated videos while requiring training of only **1%** additional parameters compared to the base video generation model.  Achieve state-of-the-art results in Face Similarity and Naturalness, surpassing methods that require full-parameter training. Stand-In seamlessly integrates with various video generation tasks.  Check out the original repo for more details:  [https://github.com/WeChatCV/Stand-In](https://github.com/WeChatCV/Stand-In)

## Getting Started

### 1. Environment Setup

```bash
# Clone the project repository
git clone https://github.com/WeChatCV/Stand-In.git
cd Stand-In

# Create and activate Conda environment
conda create -n Stand-In python=3.11 -y
conda activate Stand-In

# Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt

# (Optional) Install Flash Attention for faster inference
# Note: Make sure your GPU and CUDA version are compatible with Flash Attention
pip install flash-attn --no-build-isolation
```

### 2. Model Download

Automate the download process with the script:

```bash
python download_models.py
```

This script downloads:

*   `wan2.1-T2V-14B` (base text-to-video model)
*   `antelopev2` (face recognition model)
*   `Stand-In` (our Stand-In model)

>   *Note:*  If you have `wan2.1-T2V-14B` locally, modify `download_model.py` to avoid re-downloading and place the model in `checkpoints/wan2.1-T2V-14B`.

## Usage

### Standard Inference

Generate identity-preserving video with `infer.py`:

```bash
python infer.py \
    --prompt "A man sits comfortably at a desk, facing the camera as if talking to a friend or family member on the screen. His gaze is focused and gentle, with a natural smile. The background is his carefully decorated personal space, with photos and a world map on the wall, conveying a sense of intimate and modern communication." \
    --ip_image "test/input/lecun.jpg" \
    --output "test/output/lecun.mp4"
```

*Prompting Tip:* Use *"a man"* or *"a woman"* to maintain the subject's facial features. Both Chinese and English prompts are supported. This script is best for frontal, medium-to-close-up shots.

*Input Image:* High-resolution frontal face images are recommended.  Our pipeline automatically handles the input image resolution and file format.

---

### Inference with Community LoRA

Use `infer_with_lora.py` to integrate LoRA models:

```bash
python infer_with_lora.py \
    --prompt "A man sits comfortably at a desk, facing the camera as if talking to a friend or family member on the screen. His gaze is focused and gentle, with a natural smile. The background is his carefully decorated personal space, with photos and a world map on the wall, conveying a sense of intimate and modern communication." \
    --ip_image "test/input/lecun.jpg" \
    --output "test/output/lecun.mp4" \
    --lora_path "path/to/your/lora.safetensors" \
    --lora_scale 1.0
```

---

### Video Face Swapping (Experimental)

Use `infer_face_swap.py`:

```bash
python infer_face_swap.py \
    --prompt "The video features a woman standing in front of a large screen displaying the words ""Tech Minute"" and the logo for CNET. She is wearing a purple top and appears to be presenting or speaking about technology-related topics. The background includes a cityscape with tall buildings, suggesting an urban setting. The woman seems to be engaged in a discussion or providing information on technology news or trends. The overall atmosphere is professional and informative, likely aimed at educating viewers about the latest developments in the tech industry." \
    --ip_image "test/input/ruonan.jpg" \
    --output "test/output/ruonan.mp4" \
    --denoising_strength 0.85
```

*   *Note:* Face swapping is experimental.  Adjust `denoising_strength` for desired results. Higher values redraw the background more and the face area more naturally, while lower values reduce background changes, potentially leading to overfitting in the face. Consider using  `--force_background_consistency` with caution, as it might cause contour issues.

---

### Infer with VACE

Utilize `infer_with_vace.py` for pose-guided video generation:

```bash
python infer_with_vace.py \
    --prompt "A woman raises her hands." \
    --vace_path "checkpoints/VACE/" \
    --ip_image "test/input/first_frame.png" \
    --reference_video "test/input/pose.mp4" \
    --reference_image "test/input/first_frame.png" \
    --output "test/output/woman.mp4" \
    --vace_scale 0.8
```

*   *Requirements:* Download the VACE weights or specify the `vace_path`.  VACE weights can be downloaded with: `python download_models.py --vace`
*   *Input Control:* Preprocess the input control video with VACE's preprocessing tool. `reference_video` and `reference_image` can be used together. Reduce `vace_scale` to balance motion and identity. The weight can be reduced to 0.5 when only `ip_image` and `reference_video` are used.
*   *Note:* Combining Stand-In and VACE is more challenging. Please report any unexpected outputs.
