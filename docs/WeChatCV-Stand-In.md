The camera moves from a medium shot to a close-up, capturing her curious expression as she sees her distorted reflection." |![Image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/c3c80bbf-a1cc-46a1-b47b-1b28bcad34a3) |

The blade flashes with light as he moves—his eyes sharp, his actions swift and powerful, with his flowing robes dancing in the wind." |![Image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/1532c701-ef01-47be-86da-d33c8c6894ab)|

## Getting Started

### 1. Environment Setup

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/WeChatCV/Stand-In.git
cd Stand-In

# Create and activate Conda environment
conda create -n Stand-In python=3.11 -y
conda activate Stand-In

# Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt

# (Optional) Install Flash Attention for faster inference
# Note: Ensure your GPU and CUDA versions are compatible with Flash Attention
pip install flash-attn --no-build-isolation
```

### 2. Model Download

```bash
python download_models.py
```
This script downloads:
*   `wan2.1-T2V-14B`
*   `antelopev2`
*   `Stand-In`

> **Note:**  If you have the `wan2.1-T2V-14B` model locally, modify the `download_model.py` script and place the model in the `checkpoints/wan2.1-T2V-14B` directory.

## Usage

### Standard Inference

```bash
python infer.py \
    --prompt "A man sits comfortably at a desk, facing the camera as if talking to a friend or family member on the screen. His gaze is focused and gentle, with a natural smile. The background is his carefully decorated personal space, with photos and a world map on the wall, conveying a sense of intimate and modern communication." \
    --ip_image "test/input/lecun.jpg" \
    --output "test/output/lecun.mp4"
```

**Prompt Tip:** For minimal facial changes, use *"a man"* or *"a woman"* in the prompt.  Supports Chinese and English.  Best results with frontal, medium-to-close-up videos.

**Input Image:**  Use a high-resolution, frontal face image for optimal results.

---

### Inference with Community LoRA

```bash
python infer_with_lora.py \
    --prompt "A man sits comfortably at a desk, facing the camera as if talking to a friend or family member on the screen. His gaze is focused and gentle, with a natural smile. The background is his carefully decorated personal space, with photos and a world map on the wall, conveying a sense of intimate and modern communication." \
    --ip_image "test/input/lecun.jpg" \
    --output "test/output/lecun.mp4" \
    --lora_path "path/to/your/lora.safetensors" \
    --lora_scale 1.0
```

### Video Face Swapping

```bash
python infer_face_swap.py \
    --prompt "The video features a woman standing in front of a large screen displaying the words ""Tech Minute"" and the logo for CNET. She is wearing a purple top and appears to be presenting or speaking about technology-related topics. The background includes a cityscape with tall buildings, suggesting an urban setting. The woman seems to be engaged in a discussion or providing information on technology news or trends. The overall atmosphere is professional and informative, likely aimed at educating viewers about the latest developments in the tech industry." \
    --ip_image "test/input/ruonan.jpg" \
    --output "test/output/ruonan.mp4" \
    --denoising_strength 0.85
```

**Note:** Face swapping is experimental.

Adjust `denoising_strength` for balance between background consistency and face naturalness.  Use `--force_background_consistency` with caution, as it may cause contour issues.

---

### Infer with VACE

```bash
python infer_with_vace.py \
    --prompt "A woman raises her hands." \
    --vace_path "checkpoints/VACE/" \
    --ip_image "test/input/first_frame.png" \
    --reference_video "test/input/pose.mp4" \
    --reference_image "test/input/first_frame.png" \
    --output "test/output/woman.mp4" \
    --vace_scale 0.8
```

You need to download the corresponding weights from the `VACE` repository or provide the path to the `VACE` weights in the `vace_path` parameter.

The input control video needs to be preprocessed using VACE's preprocessing tool. Both `reference_video` and `reference_image` are optional and can exist simultaneously. Additionally, VACE’s control has a preset bias towards faces, which affects identity preservation. Please lower the `vace_scale` to a balance point where both motion and identity are preserved. When only `ip_image` and `reference_video` are provided, the weight can be reduced to 0.5.
