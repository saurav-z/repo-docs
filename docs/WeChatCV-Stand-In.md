## Getting Started

### 1. Environment Setup

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/WeChatCV/Stand-In.git
cd Stand-In

# Create and activate a Conda environment
conda create -n Stand-In python=3.11 -y
conda activate Stand-In

# Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt

# (Optional) Install Flash Attention for faster inference
pip install flash-attn --no-build-isolation
```

### 2. Model Download

Run the automated download script to fetch all required model weights into the `checkpoints` directory.
```bash
python download_models.py
```
This downloads:
*   `wan2.1-T2V-14B` (base text-to-video model)
*   `antelopev2` (face recognition model)
*   `Stand-In` (our Stand-In model)

> Note: You can manually manage model downloads by editing `download_model.py` and placing the `wan2.1-T2V-14B` model in `checkpoints/wan2.1-T2V-14B` if you have it already.

## Usage

### Standard Inference

Use `infer.py` for identity-preserving text-to-video generation.

```bash
python infer.py \
    --prompt "A man sits comfortably at a desk, facing the camera as if talking to a friend or family member on the screen. His gaze is focused and gentle, with a natural smile. The background is his carefully decorated personal space, with photos and a world map on the wall, conveying a sense of intimate and modern communication." \
    --ip_image "test/input/lecun.jpg" \
    --output "test/output/lecun.mp4"
```
**Prompting Tip:** Use *"a man"* or *"a woman"* without extra descriptions to avoid altering facial features. Prompts are supported in both Chinese and English and are designed for frontal, medium-to-close-up videos.

**Input Image Recommendation:** Use a high-resolution frontal face image for optimal results. The built-in preprocessing pipeline handles various resolutions and file extensions.

---

### Inference with Community LoRA

Use `infer_with_lora.py` to combine Stand-In with community LoRA models.

```bash
python infer_with_lora.py \
    --prompt "A man sits comfortably at a desk, facing the camera as if talking to a friend or family member on the screen. His gaze is focused and gentle, with a natural smile. The background is his carefully decorated personal space, with photos and a world map on the wall, conveying a sense of intimate and modern communication." \
    --ip_image "test/input/lecun.jpg" \
    --output "test/output/lecun.mp4" \
    --lora_path "path/to/your/lora.safetensors" \
    --lora_scale 1.0
```

### Video Face Swapping

Use `infer_face_swap.py` for video face swapping with Stand-In.

```bash
python infer_face_swap.py \
    --prompt "The video features a woman standing in front of a large screen displaying the words ""Tech Minute"" and the logo for CNET. She is wearing a purple top and appears to be presenting or speaking about technology-related topics. The background includes a cityscape with tall buildings, suggesting an urban setting. The woman seems to be engaged in a discussion or providing information on technology news or trends. The overall atmosphere is professional and informative, likely aimed at educating viewers about the latest developments in the tech industry." \
    --ip_image "test/input/ruonan.jpg" \
    --output "test/output/ruonan.mp4" \
    --denoising_strength 0.85
```
**Note**:  Face swapping is experimental due to the lack of inpainting in Wan2.1.

Adjust `denoising_strength`:  Higher values redraw the background more, potentially leading to natural-looking faces. Lower values maintain the background but risk overfitting faces.  Consider `--force_background_consistency` carefully, as it might cause noticeable contour issues.  Experiment with `denoising_strength` for best results.

### Infer with VACE

Use `infer_with_vace.py` to perform identity-preserving video generation with Stand-In and VACE.
```bash
python infer_with_vace.py \
    --prompt "A woman raises her hands." \
    --vace_path "checkpoints/VACE/" \
    --ip_image "test/input/first_frame.png" \
    --reference_video "test/input/pose.mp4" \
    --reference_image "test/input/first_frame.png" \
    --output "test/output/woman.mp4" \
    --vace_scale 0.8
```
Download the weights from the VACE repository or provide the path to the VACE weights in the `vace_path` parameter.

Preprocess the input control video with VACE's tool. Both `reference_video` and `reference_image` are optional and can exist simultaneously. Reduce `vace_scale` to balance motion and identity preservation, especially because VACE's control has a preset bias towards faces. Lower the weight to 0.5 when only `ip_image` and `reference_video` are provided.
