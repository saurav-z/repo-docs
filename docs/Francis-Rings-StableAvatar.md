StableAvatar is a groundbreaking approach to audio-driven avatar video generation, enabling the creation of videos with unparalleled length, fidelity, and identity preservation. It leverages a novel architecture that synthesizes high-quality, infinite-length videos directly, without the need for face-related post-processing techniques.

**Key Features:**

*   **Infinite-Length Video Generation:** Create avatar videos of any duration.
*   **High-Fidelity Results:** Produces videos with exceptional visual quality.
*   **Identity Preservation:** Maintains consistent facial features throughout the video.
*   **End-to-End Solution:** No need for external face-swapping or restoration tools.
*   **Time-step-aware Audio Adapter:** Prevents error accumulation and maintains audio-visual synchronization.
*   **Audio Native Guidance Mechanism:** Improves audio synchronization with a dynamic guidance signal.
*   **Dynamic Weighted Sliding-window Strategy:** Ensures smoothness in long videos.

### Environment Setup

```bash
pip install torch==2.6.0 torchvision==0.21.0 torchaudio==2.1.1 --index-url https://download.pytorch.org/whl/cu124
pip install -r requirements.txt
# Optional to install flash_attn to accelerate attention computation
pip install flash_attn
```

### Environment Setup for Blackwell series chips

pip install torch==2.7.0 torchvision==0.22.0 torchaudio==2.7.0 --index-url https://download.pytorch.org/whl/cu128
pip install -r requirements.txt
# Optional to install flash_attn to accelerate attention computation
pip install flash_attn
```

### Download Weights

Download the model weights from Hugging Face:

```bash
pip install "huggingface_hub[cli]"
cd StableAvatar
mkdir checkpoints
huggingface-cli download FrancisRing/StableAvatar --local-dir ./checkpoints
```

Ensure the following file structure:

```

├── audio_extractor.py
├── vocal_seperator.py
├── requirement.txt 
```

### Audio Extraction

Extract audio from a video file:

```bash
python audio_extractor.py --video_path="path/test/video.mp4" --saved_audio_path="path/test/audio.wav"
```

### Vocal Separation

Separate vocals from audio for better lip-sync:

```bash
pip install audio-separator[gpu]
python vocal_seperator.py --audio_separator_model_file="path/StableAvatar/checkpoints/Kim_Vocal_2.onnx" --audio_file_path="path/test/audio.wav" --saved_vocal_path="path/test/vocal.wav"
```

### Base Model Inference

Run inference using `inference.sh`.  Customize settings for desired resolution, prompts, and model paths.

```bash
bash inference.sh
```

**Key Parameters to Customize:**

*   `--width` and `--height`:  Set the output video resolution (512x512, 480x832, or 832x480).
*   `--output_dir`:  Specify the save location for generated videos.
*   `--validation_reference_path`, `--validation_driven_audio_path`, `--validation_prompts`: Paths for reference image, audio, and text prompts.
*   `--pretrained_model_name_or_path`, `--pretrained_wav2vec_path`, `--transformer_path`:  Paths to pre-trained model weights.
*   `--sample_steps`, `--overlap_window_length`, `--clip_sample_n_frames`: Inference parameters (recommended: sample_steps: 30-50, overlap_window_length: 5-15).
*   `--sample_text_guide_scale`, `--sample_audio_guide_scale`:  CFG scales (recommended: 3-6). Increase audio cfg for lip-sync improvements.
*   `--GPU_memory_mode`: `model_full_load`, `sequential_cpu_offload`, `model_cpu_offload_and_qfloat8`, and `model_cpu_offload`

**Important Notes:**

*   Wan2.1-1.3B supports 512x512, 480x832, and 832x480 resolutions.
*   Use `--GPU_memory_mode` to manage GPU memory constraints. `sequential_cpu_offload` (approx 3GB) and `model_cpu_offload` (reduce usage by approx half) are helpful.
*   For multi-GPU inference, adjust `--ulysses_degree` and `--ring_degree` in `inference.sh`.  (Ensure  `ulysses_degree * ring_degree = total GPUs / world-size`)
*   If you have multiple Gpus, you can run Multi-GPU inference to speed up by modifying "--ulysses_degree" and "--ring_degree" in `inference.sh`. For example, if you have 8 GPUs, you can set `--ulysses_degree=4` and `--ring_degree=2`. Notably, you have to ensure ulysses_degree*ring_degree=total GPU number/world-size. Moreover, you can also add `--fsdp_dit` in `inference.sh` to activate FSDP in DiT to further reduce GPU memory consumption.

  *   You can fun the following command:
```
bash multiple_gpu_inference.sh
```

*   Use `ffmpeg` to add audio to your video output:

```bash
ffmpeg -i video_without_audio.mp4 -i /path/audio.wav -c:v copy -c:a aac -shortest /path/output_with_audio.mp4
```
### Gradio Interface

Launch a Gradio interface for easier use:

```bash
python app.py
```

## Model Training

Detailed instructions for training StableAvatar, including dataset formatting, are included in the original README.

**Key aspects of training are highlighted below:**

*   **Dataset Organization:**
    The training data requires specific file organization as outlined in the original README, including subfolders for different video types and individual video information.
*   **Data Preparation:** Instructions for extracting and preparing frames, face masks, lip masks, and audio are provided.
*   **Training Scripts:** Run the `train_1B_square.sh` (single resolution, single machine), `train_1B_square_64.sh` (single resolution, multiple machines), `train_1B_rec_vec.sh` (mixed resolution, single machine), or `train_1B_rec_vec_64.sh` (mixed resolution, multiple machines) to train the model. The training setup consists of 8 nodes, each equipped with 8 NVIDIA A100 80GB GPUs, for training StableAvatar.
*   **VRAM Requirements:**  Training requires approx. 50GB VRAM (mixed resolution) or 40GB (512x512 only).
*   **Static Backgrounds:** The video backgrounds should remain static for accurate reconstruction loss calculation.
*   **Clear Audio:** Ensure the audio is clear with minimal background noise.

###  Finetuning & Lora Training

Finetuning and Lora training is also available and detailed in the original README.

### VRAM Requirement and Runtime
For the 5s video (480x832, fps=25), the basic model (--GPU_memory_mode="model_full_load") requires approximately 18GB VRAM and finishes in 3 minutes on a 4090 GPU.
Theoretically, StableAvatar is capable of synthesizing hours of video without significant quality degradation; however, the 3D VAE decoder demands significant GPU memory, especially when decoding 10k+ frames. You have the option to run the VAE decoder on CPU.
