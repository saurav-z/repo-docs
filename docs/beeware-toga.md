*   **Python-First:** Develop using pure Python; no need to learn platform-specific languages or frameworks.
*   **Open Source:** Toga is part of the BeeWare project and is free and open-source software.
*   **Extensive Widget Library:** Provides a comprehensive set of widgets for building complex user interfaces.
