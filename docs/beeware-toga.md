## Key Features

*   **Native Look and Feel:** Toga applications use the native widgets of each platform, ensuring a familiar user experience.
*   **Cross-Platform Development:** Write your GUI code once and run it on multiple operating systems (Windows, macOS, Linux, iOS, Android, and WebAssembly).
*   **Python-Centric:** Toga is built from the ground up for Python developers, making it easy to integrate with your existing Python projects.
*   **Modern Toolkit:** Toga provides a modern and well-designed API for building user interfaces.
