*   **Production-Ready Libraries:** Utilize stable, well-tested libraries for reliable production deployments.
*   **Azure SDK Design Guidelines:** Libraries following the Azure SDK Design Guidelines for Python, ensuring a consistent development experience.
*   **Management Libraries:** Manage and provision Azure resources using libraries adhering to Azure SDK guidelines.
*   **Active Development:** Benefit from ongoing improvements and updates to support the latest Azure features.
*   **Telemetry and Configuration:** Allows for the optional configuration of telemetry collection.

## Getting Started

Individual service libraries are available, allowing you to choose the specific packages you need. Refer to the `README.md` (or `README.rst`) files within each library's project folder to get started with a specific service.

## Prerequisites

The client libraries are supported on Python 3.9 or later.  See the [Azure SDK for Python version support policy](https://github.com/Azure/azure-sdk-for-python/wiki/Azure-SDKs-Python-version-support-policy) for details.

## Available Packages

Libraries are organized into categories:

*   [Client - New Releases](#client-new-releases)
*   [Client - Previous Versions](#client-previous-versions)
*   [Management - New Releases](#management-new-releases)
*   [Management - Previous Versions](#management-previous-versions)

### Client: New Releases

These libraries allow you to use and consume existing resources and interact with them, for example: upload a blob.  These libraries share core functionalities such as: retries, logging, transport protocols, authentication protocols, etc. that can be found in the [azure-core](https://github.com/Azure/azure-sdk-for-python/blob/main/sdk/core/azure-core) library.  Learn more about these libraries by reading guidelines that they follow [here](https://azure.github.io/azure-sdk/python/guidelines/index.html).

Find the [most up-to-date list of all of the new packages here](https://azure.github.io/azure-sdk/releases/latest/index.html#python)

> **Note:** Use stable, non-preview libraries for production.

### Client: Previous Versions

These are the last stable versions of production-ready packages.  They may not have the same features or follow the same guidelines as the new releases, but offer wider service coverage.

### Management: New Releases

A new set of management libraries following the [Azure SDK Design Guidelines for Python](https://azure.github.io/azure-sdk/python/guidelines/). These new libraries provide core capabilities shared across all Azure SDKs.

Documentation and code samples can be found [here](https://aka.ms/azsdk/python/mgmt). A migration guide is located [here](https://github.com/Azure/azure-sdk-for-python/blob/main/doc/sphinx/mgmt_quickstart.rst#migration-guide).

Find the [most up to date list of all of the new packages here](https://azure.github.io/azure-sdk/releases/latest/mgmt/python.html)

> **Note:** Use stable, non-preview libraries for production. Refer to the migration guide if you experience authentication issues after upgrading management packages.

### Management: Previous Versions

For a complete list of management libraries that enable you to provision and manage Azure resources, please [check here](https://azure.github.io/azure-sdk/releases/latest/all/python.html). They might not have the same feature set as the new releases but they do offer wider coverage of services.
Management libraries can be identified by namespaces that start with `azure-mgmt-`, e.g. `azure-mgmt-compute`

## Data Collection

The software may collect data that is sent to Microsoft. You can learn more about data collection and use in the help documentation and Microsoftâ€™s [privacy statement](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkID=824704). For more information on the data collected by the Azure SDK, please visit the [Telemetry Guidelines](https://azure.github.io/azure-sdk/general_azurecore.html#telemetry-policy) page.

### Telemetry Configuration

Telemetry collection is on by default.

To opt out, disable telemetry during client construction.  Create a `NoUserAgentPolicy` class and pass an instance during client creation.

```python
import os
from azure.identity import ManagedIdentityCredential
from azure.storage.blob import BlobServiceClient
from azure.core.pipeline.policies import UserAgentPolicy


# Create your credential you want to use
mi_credential = ManagedIdentityCredential()

account_url = "https://<storageaccountname>.blob.core.windows.net"

# Set up user-agent override
class NoUserAgentPolicy(UserAgentPolicy):
    def on_request(self, request):
        pass

# Create the BlobServiceClient object
blob_service_client = BlobServiceClient(account_url, credential=mi_credential, user_agent_policy=NoUserAgentPolicy())

container_client = blob_service_client.get_container_client(container=<container_name>)
# TODO: do something with the container client like download blob to a file
```
