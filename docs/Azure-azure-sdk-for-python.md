# Azure SDK for Python: Build Powerful Python Applications with Microsoft Azure

The Azure SDK for Python empowers developers to seamlessly integrate their Python applications with a wide range of Azure services.  **(See the original repo: [https://github.com/Azure/azure-sdk-for-python](https://github.com/Azure/azure-sdk-for-python))**

**Key Features:**

*   **Comprehensive Service Coverage:** Access a broad spectrum of Azure services, including storage, compute, databases, AI/ML, and more.
*   **Modular Packages:** Utilize individual, focused libraries for specific Azure services, promoting efficient development and reduced dependencies.
*   **Modern Design Guidelines:** Benefit from libraries built according to the Azure SDK Design Guidelines for Python, ensuring consistency, ease of use, and a familiar developer experience.
*   **Client and Management Libraries:** Leverage client libraries for interacting with existing resources (e.g., uploading blobs) and management libraries for provisioning and managing Azure resources.
*   **Robust Core Functionality:** Leverage shared core features such as retries, logging, authentication, and more.
*   **Active Development & Support:**  Benefit from ongoing development and support from Microsoft, ensuring up-to-date features and compatibility.
*   **Telemetry & Privacy:** Understand data collection practices and easily configure telemetry settings to meet your application's needs.

**Getting Started:**

*   **Prerequisites:** The client libraries are supported on Python 3.9 or later.
*   **Library Structure:** Service libraries are located within the `/sdk` directory. Each service has a separate set of libraries.
*   **Documentation:** For detailed documentation, visit our [Azure SDK for Python documentation](https://aka.ms/python-docs).

**Package Categories:**

*   **Client - New Releases:** Preview and GA (Generally Available) libraries for interacting with existing resources.
*   **Client - Previous Versions:** Stable, production-ready versions of client libraries.
*   **Management - New Releases:** New management libraries following Azure SDK design guidelines.
*   **Management - Previous Versions:** Libraries for provisioning and managing Azure resources.
