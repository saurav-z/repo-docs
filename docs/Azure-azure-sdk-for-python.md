The Azure SDK for Python provides a comprehensive set of libraries, enabling you to interact with various Azure services from your Python applications. This SDK is actively developed and offers the latest features, performance improvements, and security updates.

**Key Features:**

*   **Comprehensive Service Coverage:** Access a wide array of Azure services, including storage, compute, networking, databases, and more.
*   **Easy Integration:**  Integrate with Azure services using Pythonic APIs, making it easier to manage and utilize Azure resources.
*   **Modern Architecture:** Leverages core functionalities for consistency, including retries, logging, transport protocols, and authentication.
*   **Management and Client Libraries:** Utilize both new and previous versions of management libraries, offering functionality to provision and manage resources.
*   **Up-to-Date Documentation:**  Access detailed documentation and code samples to get started quickly.
*   **Production-Ready Libraries:** Utilize stable, non-preview libraries for your code and ensure you have production-ready code.

**Getting Started:**

Choose the library that corresponds with the Azure service you want to integrate.  Explore the `README.md` (or `README.rst`) file within each service's project folder within the `/sdk` directory for detailed instructions.

**Prerequisites:**

The client libraries support Python 3.9 or later. For details, see the [Azure SDK for Python version support policy](https://github.com/Azure/azure-sdk-for-python/wiki/Azure-SDKs-Python-version-support-policy).

**Available Packages**

The Azure SDK for Python libraries are categorized as:

*   [Client - New Releases](#client-new-releases)
*   [Client - Previous Versions](#client-previous-versions)
*   [Management - New Releases](#management-new-releases)
*   [Management - Previous Versions](#management-previous-versions)

### Client: New Releases

New wave of packages that we are announcing as **GA** and several that are currently releasing in **preview**. These libraries allow you to use and consume existing resources and interact with them, for example: upload a blob. These libraries share  several core functionalities such as: retries, logging, transport protocols, authentication protocols, etc. that can be found in the [azure-core](https://github.com/Azure/azure-sdk-for-python/blob/main/sdk/core/azure-core) library. You can learn more about these libraries by reading guidelines that they follow [here](https://azure.github.io/azure-sdk/python/guidelines/index.html).

You can find the [most up to date list of all of the new packages on our page](https://azure.github.io/azure-sdk/releases/latest/index.html#python)

> NOTE: If you need to ensure your code is ready for production use one of the stable, non-preview libraries.

### Client: Previous Versions

Last stable versions of packages that have been provided for usage with Azure and are production-ready. These libraries provide you with similar functionalities to the Preview ones as they allow you to use and consume existing resources and interact with them, for example: upload a blob. They might not implement the [guidelines](https://azure.github.io/azure-sdk/python/guidelines/index.html) or have the same feature set as the November releases. They do however offer wider coverage of services.

### Management: New Releases
A new set of management libraries that follow the [Azure SDK Design Guidelines for Python](https://azure.github.io/azure-sdk/python/guidelines/) are now available. These new libraries provide a number of core capabilities that are shared amongst all Azure SDKs, including the intuitive Azure Identity library, an HTTP Pipeline with custom policies, error-handling, distributed tracing, and much more.
Documentation and code samples for these new libraries can be found [here](https://aka.ms/azsdk/python/mgmt). In addition, a migration guide that shows how to transition from older versions of libraries is located [here](https://github.com/Azure/azure-sdk-for-python/blob/main/doc/sphinx/mgmt_quickstart.rst#migration-guide).

You can find the [most up to date list of all of the new packages on our page](https://azure.github.io/azure-sdk/releases/latest/mgmt/python.html)

> NOTE: If you need to ensure your code is ready for production use one of the stable, non-preview libraries. Also, if you are experiencing authentication issues with the management libraries after upgrading certain packages, it's possible that you upgraded to the new versions of SDK without changing the authentication code, please refer to the migration guide mentioned above for proper instructions.

### Management: Previous Versions
For a complete list of management libraries that enable you to provision and manage Azure resources, please [check here](https://azure.github.io/azure-sdk/releases/latest/all/python.html). They might not have the same feature set as the new releases but they do offer wider coverage of services.
Management libraries can be identified by namespaces that start with `azure-mgmt-`, e.g. `azure-mgmt-compute`

**Data Collection**

The software may collect information about you and your use of the software and send it to Microsoft. Microsoft may use this information to provide services and improve our products and services. You may turn off the telemetry as described below. You can learn more about data collection and use in the help documentation and Microsoftâ€™s [privacy statement](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkID=824704). For more information on the data collected by the Azure SDK, please visit the [Telemetry Guidelines](https://azure.github.io/azure-sdk/general_azurecore.html#telemetry-policy) page.

### Telemetry Configuration

Telemetry collection is on by default.

To opt out, you can disable telemetry at client construction. Define a `NoUserAgentPolicy` class that is a subclass of `UserAgentPolicy` with an `on_request` method that does nothing. Then pass instance of this class as kwargs `user_agent_policy=NoUserAgentPolicy()` during client creation. This will disable telemetry for all methods in the client. Do this for every new client.

The example below uses the `azure-storage-blob` package. In your code, you can replace `azure-storage-blob` with the package you are using.

```python
import os
from azure.identity import ManagedIdentityCredential
from azure.storage.blob import BlobServiceClient
from azure.core.pipeline.policies import UserAgentPolicy


# Create your credential you want to use
mi_credential = ManagedIdentityCredential()

account_url = "https://<storageaccountname>.blob.core.windows.net"

# Set up user-agent override
class NoUserAgentPolicy(UserAgentPolicy):
    def on_request(self, request):
        pass

# Create the BlobServiceClient object
blob_service_client = BlobServiceClient(account_url, credential=mi_credential, user_agent_policy=NoUserAgentPolicy())

container_client = blob_service_client.get_container_client(container=<container_name>) 
# TODO: do something with the container client like download blob to a file
```
