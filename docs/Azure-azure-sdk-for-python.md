The Azure SDK for Python provides a comprehensive set of libraries to interact with Azure services, enabling developers to build robust, scalable, and secure cloud applications.  Find the source code on [GitHub](https://github.com/Azure/azure-sdk-for-python).

## Key Features

*   **Comprehensive Service Coverage:** Access a wide range of Azure services including compute, storage, networking, databases, and more.
*   **Modern Design:** Benefit from libraries that follow the [Azure SDK Design Guidelines for Python](https://azure.github.io/azure-sdk/python/guidelines/), ensuring consistency and ease of use.
*   **Production-Ready:** Choose from stable, non-preview libraries for reliable performance in your production environments.
*   **Enhanced Capabilities**: Benefit from several core capabilities such as: retries, logging, transport protocols, authentication protocols, etc.
*   **Up-to-date Packages:** Find the [most up to date list of all of the new packages on our page](https://azure.github.io/azure-sdk/releases/latest/index.html#python)

## Getting Started

The Azure SDK for Python uses service-specific libraries.

*   **Prerequisites:**  Requires Python 3.9 or later. See the [Azure SDK for Python version support policy](https://github.com/Azure/azure-sdk-for-python/wiki/Azure-SDKs-Python-version-support-policy) for details.
*   **Service Libraries:** Explore the `/sdk` directory to locate service-specific libraries. Refer to each library's `README.md` or `README.rst` file for detailed instructions.

## Package Categories

Explore available packages, categorized by release status and service type:

*   [Client - New Releases](#client-new-releases)
*   [Client - Previous Versions](#client-previous-versions)
*   [Management - New Releases](#management-new-releases)

## Data Collection & Telemetry

The software collects information about your use, which is sent to Microsoft to improve products and services. You can learn more about data collection in the help documentation and Microsoftâ€™s [privacy statement](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkID=824704) or on the [Telemetry Guidelines](https://azure.github.io/azure-sdk/general_azurecore.html#telemetry-policy) page.

### Telemetry Configuration

Telemetry collection is on by default. To opt out, you can disable telemetry at client construction.

```python
import os
from azure.identity import ManagedIdentityCredential
from azure.storage.blob import BlobServiceClient
from azure.core.pipeline.policies import UserAgentPolicy

# Create your credential you want to use
mi_credential = ManagedIdentityCredential()

account_url = "https://<storageaccountname>.blob.core.windows.net"

# Set up user-agent override
class NoUserAgentPolicy(UserAgentPolicy):
    def on_request(self, request):
        pass

# Create the BlobServiceClient object
blob_service_client = BlobServiceClient(account_url, credential=mi_credential, user_agent_policy=NoUserAgentPolicy())

container_client = blob_service_client.get_container_client(container=<container_name>) 
# TODO: do something with the container client like download blob to a file
```
