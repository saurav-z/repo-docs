## Key Features

*   **Comprehensive Service Coverage:** Access a wide array of Azure services, including storage, compute, networking, databases, and more.
*   **Client and Management Libraries:** Utilize both client libraries for interacting with existing resources and management libraries for provisioning and managing Azure resources.
*   **Modern Design:** Follows the [Azure SDK Design Guidelines for Python](https://azure.github.io/azure-sdk/python/guidelines/) for consistency and ease of use.
*   **Authentication and Authorization:** Integrated with Azure Active Directory and other authentication methods for secure access.
*   **Asynchronous Operations:** Leverage asynchronous programming for improved performance and scalability.
*   **Telemetry Configuration:** Configure telemetry to disable data collection to suit your needs.
*   **Regular Updates:** Benefit from frequent updates and new features as Azure services evolve.
*   **Detailed Documentation:** Access comprehensive documentation to guide you through the SDK.

## Getting Started

Choose from a variety of libraries for specific Azure services, each with its own README.md for detailed usage information. Explore the `/sdk` directory to find service-specific libraries.

### Prerequisites

Ensure your environment meets these requirements:

*   Python 3.9 or later.
*   For detailed support policy, please read [Azure SDK for Python version support policy](https://github.com/Azure/azure-sdk-for-python/wiki/Azure-SDKs-Python-version-support-policy).

## Packages Available

Explore the available packages based on your needs:

*   [Client - New Releases](#client-new-releases)
*   [Client - Previous Versions](#client-previous-versions)
*   [Management - New Releases](#management-new-releases)
*   [Management - Previous Versions](#management-previous-versions)

### Client: New Releases

These **GA** (General Availability) and **preview** packages enable you to interact with existing resources, such as uploading a blob. These libraries share core functionalities like retries, logging, and authentication protocols found in the [azure-core](https://github.com/Azure/azure-sdk-for-python/blob/main/sdk/core/azure-core) library. Explore the [guidelines](https://azure.github.io/azure-sdk/python/guidelines/index.html) to learn more.

Find the [most up-to-date list of new packages](https://azure.github.io/azure-sdk/releases/latest/index.html#python).

> NOTE: For production, use stable, non-preview libraries.

### Client: Previous Versions

These are the last stable versions of packages that provide production-ready Azure usage. Similar to the Preview ones, these libraries allow you to use and consume existing resources and interact with them, for example: upload a blob. They might not implement the [guidelines](https://azure.github.io/azure-sdk/python/guidelines/index.html) or have the same feature set as the November releases. They do however offer wider coverage of services.

### Management: New Releases

The new management libraries adhere to the [Azure SDK Design Guidelines for Python](https://azure.github.io/azure-sdk/python/guidelines/). They offer essential capabilities shared across all Azure SDKs, including the Azure Identity library, HTTP Pipeline, error handling, and distributed tracing.

Find documentation and code samples [here](https://aka.ms/azsdk/python/mgmt) and a migration guide [here](https://github.com/Azure/azure-sdk-for-python/blob/main/doc/sphinx/mgmt_quickstart.rst#migration-guide).

Find the [most up to date list of all of the new packages on our page](https://azure.github.io/azure-sdk/releases/latest/mgmt/python.html)

> NOTE: For production use, choose stable, non-preview libraries. Refer to the migration guide if upgrading management libraries and experiencing authentication issues.

### Management: Previous Versions

For a comprehensive list of management libraries, check [here](https://azure.github.io/azure-sdk/releases/latest/all/python.html). These libraries may not have all the features of the new releases, but they offer extensive service coverage. Management libraries start with the `azure-mgmt-` namespace (e.g., `azure-mgmt-compute`).

## Data Collection

The SDK may collect data, which can be disabled. You can learn more about data collection and use in the help documentation and Microsoftâ€™s [privacy statement](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkID=824704). For more information on the data collected by the Azure SDK, please visit the [Telemetry Guidelines](https://azure.github.io/azure-sdk/general_azurecore.html#telemetry-policy) page.

### Telemetry Configuration

Telemetry collection is on by default.
To opt out, disable telemetry at client construction, by defining a `NoUserAgentPolicy` class and passing it as `user_agent_policy=NoUserAgentPolicy()`

```python
import os
from azure.identity import ManagedIdentityCredential
from azure.storage.blob import BlobServiceClient
from azure.core.pipeline.policies import UserAgentPolicy


# Create your credential you want to use
mi_credential = ManagedIdentityCredential()

account_url = "https://<storageaccountname>.blob.core.windows.net"

# Set up user-agent override
class NoUserAgentPolicy(UserAgentPolicy):
    def on_request(self, request):
        pass

# Create the BlobServiceClient object
blob_service_client = BlobServiceClient(account_url, credential=mi_credential, user_agent_policy=NoUserAgentPolicy())

container_client = blob_service_client.get_container_client(container=<container_name>) 
# TODO: do something with the container client like download blob to a file
```
