# Azure SDK for Python: Build Powerful Python Applications with Azure Services

**Get started with the Azure SDK for Python and seamlessly integrate Azure cloud services into your Python projects.** ([Original Repository](https://github.com/Azure/azure-sdk-for-python))

This repository provides the actively developed Azure SDK for Python, offering a comprehensive set of libraries to interact with Azure services.

## Key Features

*   **Comprehensive Service Coverage:** Access a wide range of Azure services through dedicated client and management libraries.
*   **Client Libraries (New Releases):** Leverage the latest, production-ready libraries for interacting with existing Azure resources. These libraries provide core functionalities such as retries, logging, authentication, and transport protocols.
*   **Client Libraries (Previous Versions):** Utilize stable, production-ready versions of client libraries offering broader service coverage.
*   **Management Libraries (New Releases):** Manage Azure resources with new management libraries that adhere to the Azure SDK Design Guidelines. These include intuitive authentication, error handling, and distributed tracing capabilities.
*   **Management Libraries (Previous Versions):** Utilize existing management libraries for provisioning and managing Azure resources.
*   **Azure SDK Design Guidelines:** Libraries follow established guidelines to ensure consistency and ease of use.
*   **Version Support:** Supports Python 3.9 and later.
*   **Detailed Documentation:** Access extensive documentation for each service, including quickstarts, code samples, and migration guides.

## Getting Started
