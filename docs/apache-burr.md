## What Can You Build with Burr?

Burr empowers you to create a wide range of AI-powered applications:

*   **Chatbots:** Build conversational interfaces, including simple and stateful RAG-based chatbots.
*   **Agents:** Develop intelligent agents for various tasks.
*   **Simulations:** Create and manage complex simulations.
*   **Interactive Assistants:** Design assistants for writing emails and other tasks.
*   **LLM-based Adventure Games:** Build interactive experiences.
*   **ML Training:** Hyperparameter tuning and other ML experiments.

## Getting Started

1.  **Installation:**

    ```bash
    pip install "burr[start]"
    ```
2.  **Run the UI:**
    ```bash
    burr
    ```
3.  **Explore Examples:** Start coding and running examples, such as the hello-world-counter.
4.  **Dive Deeper:** Refer to the [getting started guide](https://burr.dagworks.io/getting_started/simple-example/) and the [documentation](https://burr.dagworks.io/) for detailed instructions.

## How Burr Works

Burr uses a simple and expressive API to define your application as a state machine. You define actions (functions) and transitions between states. This approach enables easy state management, complex decision-making, and workflow control.  See the example code in the original README for more details.

## Roadmap

Burr's development roadmap includes:

*   FastAPI integration and deployment support
*   Usability and efficiency improvements
*   Enhanced framework integrations (e.g., LCEL, LlamaIndex, Hamilton)
*   Improved metadata capture and surfacing
*   Additional storage integrations

Burr Cloud is coming soon for hosted execution. [Join the waitlist](https://forms.gle/w9u2QKcPrztApRedA) to get early access.
