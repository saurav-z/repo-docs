## Key Features

*   **State Machine Framework:**  Burr allows you to express your application logic as a state machine, making complex workflows manageable and traceable.
*   **UI for Monitoring & Debugging:** Real-time telemetry UI to track execution, monitor state changes, and debug your applications.
*   **Framework-Agnostic:** Integrates seamlessly with your favorite LLM frameworks and other tools.
*   **Pluggable Persisters:**  Easily save and load application state with pluggable persisters.
*   **Built-in Integrations:** Provides integrations to persist state, connect to telemetry, and integrate with other systems.
*   **Non-LLM Applications:** Burr can be used for various non-LLM use cases.

## Quick Start

1.  **Install:** `pip install "burr[start]"`
2.  **Run the UI:** `burr`
3.  **Explore the Demo:**  Access the chatbot demo in the UI (requires `OPENAI_API_KEY`).
4.  **Run an Example:**

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/dagworks-inc/burr && cd burr/examples/hello-world-counter
    python application.py
    ```

    See the [Getting Started Guide](https://burr.dagworks.io/getting_started/simple-example/) for more detailed instructions.

## How Burr Works

Burr's core API simplifies building state machines with Python functions:

*   Define actions using `@action`.
*   Specify reads and writes to the state.
*   Create transitions between actions.
*   The UI allows you to see the application running, and it also has a demo chat application.

## Use Cases

Burr is suitable for a wide range of AI applications, including:

*   Chatbots (simple and RAG-based)
*   LLM-based adventure games
*   Interactive assistants (e.g., email writing)
*   Simulations and hyperparameter tuning (non-LLM)

## Testimonials

> "After evaluating several other obfuscating LLM frameworks, their elegant yet comprehensive state management solution proved to be the powerful answer to rolling out robots driven by AI decision-making."
>
> **Ashish Ghosh**
> *CTO, Peanut Robotics*

> "Of course, you can use it [LangChain], but whether it's really production-ready and improves the time from 'code-to-prod' [...], we've been doing LLM apps for two years, and the answer is no [...] All these 'all-in-one' libs suffer from this [...]. Honestly, take a look at Burr. Thank me later."
>
> **Reddit user cyan2k**
> *LocalLlama, Subreddit*

> "Using Burr is a no-brainer if you want to build a modular AI application. It is so easy to build with, and I especially love their UI which makes debugging a piece of cake. And the always-ready-to-help team is the cherry on top."
>
> **Ishita**
> *Founder, Watto.ai*

> "I just came across Burr and I'm like WOW, this seems like you guys predicted this exact need when building this. No weird esoteric concepts just because it's AI."
>
> **Matthew Rideout**
> *Staff Software Engineer, Paxton AI*

> "Burr's state management part is really helpful for creating state snapshots and building debugging, replaying, and even evaluation cases around that."
>
> **Rinat Gareev**
> *Senior Solutions Architect, Provectus*

> "I have been using Burr over the past few months, and compared to many agentic LLM platforms out there (e.g. LangChain, CrewAi, AutoGen, Agency Swarm, etc), Burr provides a more robust framework for designing complex behaviors."
>
> **Hadi Nayebi**
> *Co-founder, CognitiveGraphs*

> "Moving from LangChain to Burr was a game-changer!
> - **Time-Saving**: It took me just a few hours to get started with Burr, compared to the days and weeks I spent trying to navigate LangChain.
> - **Cleaner Implementation**: With Burr, I could finally have a cleaner, more sophisticated, and stable implementation. No more wrestling with complex codebases.
> - **Team Adoption**: I pitched Burr to my teammates, and we pivoted our entire codebase to it. It's been a smooth ride ever since."
>
