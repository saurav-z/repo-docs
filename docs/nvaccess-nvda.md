## Key Features

*   **Completely Free:**  NVDA is free to download, use, and share, making it accessible to everyone.
*   **Open Source:**  Developed collaboratively by NV Access and a global community, fostering transparency and continuous improvement.
*   **Comprehensive Accessibility:** Allows users to navigate applications, browse the web, read documents, and more.

## How NVDA Works

NVDA works by interpreting the visual content on your screen and providing it to the user through synthesized speech or braille. This allows users to "see" what is on their screen, even if they cannot see the screen visually.
