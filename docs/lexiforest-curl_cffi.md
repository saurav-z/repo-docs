# curl_cffi: The Fastest & Most Advanced Python HTTP Client with Browser Impersonation

Tired of getting blocked while web scraping? **`curl_cffi` allows you to seamlessly impersonate browsers and bypass anti-bot measures.**  This powerful Python library provides a robust and high-performance alternative to `requests` and `httpx`, allowing you to make HTTP requests that mimic browser behavior.  Check out the [original repo](https://github.com/lexiforest/curl_cffi) for the source code.

**Notes:**
1.  For pycurl, you need an http/3 enabled libcurl to make it work, while curl_cffi packages libcurl-impersonate inside Python wheels.
2.  Since v0.11.4.

## Installation

```bash
pip install curl_cffi --upgrade
```

For beta releases:

```bash
pip install curl_cffi --upgrade --pre
```

For the unstable version from GitHub:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/lexiforest/curl_cffi/
cd curl_cffi
make preprocess
pip install .
```

## Usage

### Requests-like API

```python
import curl_cffi

# Notice the impersonate parameter
r = curl_cffi.get("https://tls.browserleaks.com/json", impersonate="chrome")
print(r.json())

# To keep using the latest browser version as `curl_cffi` updates,
# simply set impersonate="chrome" without specifying a version.
r = curl_cffi.get("https://tls.browserleaks.com/json", impersonate="chrome")

# To pin a specific version, use version numbers together.
r = curl_cffi.get("https://tls.browserleaks.com/json", impersonate="chrome124")

# http/socks proxies are supported
proxies = {"https": "http://localhost:3128"}
r = curl_cffi.get("https://tls.browserleaks.com/json", impersonate="chrome", proxies=proxies)
```

### Sessions

```python
s = curl_cffi.Session()

# httpbin is a http test website, this endpoint makes the server set cookies
s.get("https://httpbin.org/cookies/set/foo/bar")
print(s.cookies)
# <Cookies[<Cookie foo=bar for httpbin.org />]>

# retrieve cookies again to verify
r = s.get("https://httpbin.org/cookies")
print(r.json())
# {'cookies': {'foo': 'bar'}}
```

import asyncio

async with AsyncSession() as s:
    r = await s.get("https://example.com")
    print(r.status_code)

async with AsyncSession() as s:
    ws = await s.ws_connect("wss://echo.websocket.org")
    await asyncio.gather(*[ws.send_str("Hello, World!") for _ in range(10)])
    async for message in ws:
        print(message)
