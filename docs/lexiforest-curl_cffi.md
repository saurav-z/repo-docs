**Bypass website restrictions and scrape the web with ease using `curl_cffi`, a powerful Python library that mimics browser fingerprints to avoid detection.**

**[View the original repository on GitHub](https://github.com/lexiforest/curl_cffi)**

## Key Features:

*   **Browser Impersonation:** Mimic various browsers' TLS/JA3 and HTTP/2 fingerprints (Chrome, Safari, Firefox, and more) to evade anti-scraping measures.
*   **High Performance:** Significantly faster than `requests` and `httpx`, comparable to `aiohttp` and `pycurl`, see [benchmarks](https://github.com/lexiforest/curl_cffi/tree/main/benchmark).
*   **Familiar API:** Uses a `requests`-like API, making it easy to learn and integrate.
*   **Asynchronous Support:** Includes `asyncio` support with proxy rotation for efficient, concurrent requests.
*   **HTTP/2 and HTTP/3 Support:** Supports modern HTTP protocols that `requests` doesn't.
*   **WebSockets:** Provides support for WebSocket connections.
*   **Pre-compiled:** No need for manual compilation on your machine, making installation simple.

## Installation

```bash
pip install curl_cffi --upgrade
```

## Usage Examples

### Requests-like API (v0.10+)

```python
import curl_cffi

# Impersonate Chrome
r = curl_cffi.get("https://tls.browserleaks.com/json", impersonate="chrome")
print(r.json())

# Pin a specific version (e.g. Chrome 124)
r = curl_cffi.get("https://tls.browserleaks.com/json", impersonate="chrome124")

# Use proxies
proxies = {"https": "http://localhost:3128"}
r = curl_cffi.get("https://tls.browserleaks.com/json", impersonate="chrome", proxies=proxies)
```

### Sessions
```python
s = curl_cffi.Session()

# httpbin is a http test website, this endpoint makes the server set cookies
s.get("https://httpbin.org/cookies/set/foo/bar")
print(s.cookies)

# retrieve cookies again to verify
r = s.get("https://httpbin.org/cookies")
print(r.json())
# {'cookies': {'foo': 'bar'}}
```

### Asyncio Example
```python
import asyncio
from curl_cffi import AsyncSession

async with AsyncSession() as s:
    r = await s.get("https://example.com")
```

## Supported Browsers

`curl_cffi` supports browser versions compatible with the [curl-impersonate](https://github.com/lexiforest/curl-impersonate) fork.
