[Documentation](https://curl-cffi.readthedocs.io)

`curl_cffi` is a Python binding for the [curl-impersonate fork](https://github.com/lexiforest/curl-impersonate) via [cffi](https://cffi.readthedocs.io/en/latest/), designed to bypass bot detection and web scraping restrictions. It offers browser fingerprinting capabilities, making it a robust alternative to traditional HTTP clients like `requests` and `httpx`. For commercial support, visit [impersonate.pro](https://impersonate.pro).

## Key Features

*   **Browser Impersonation:** Emulates various browser fingerprints (TLS/JA3 and HTTP/2) including Chrome, Safari, Firefox, and more, for advanced scraping.
*   **High Performance:** Significantly faster than `requests` and `httpx`, comparable to `aiohttp` and `pycurl`, as shown in [benchmarks](https://github.com/lexiforest/curl_cffi/tree/main/benchmark).
*   **Familiar API:**  Offers a user-friendly API similar to the `requests` library, minimizing the learning curve.
*   **Asynchronous Support:** Includes full support for `asyncio`, and proxy rotation for asynchronous requests.
*   **HTTP/2 & HTTP/3 Support:** Offers native support for both HTTP/2 and HTTP/3 protocols.
*   **Websocket Support:** Provides websocket functionality.
*   **Cross-Platform:** Pre-compiled wheels available for Linux, macOS, and Windows.

## Installation

```bash
pip install curl_cffi --upgrade
```

## Usage

`curl_cffi` has both a low-level `curl` API and a high-level, `requests`-like API.

### Requests-like Example

```python
import curl_cffi

r = curl_cffi.get("https://tls.browserleaks.com/json", impersonate="chrome")
print(r.json())
```

### Sessions Example

```python
s = curl_cffi.Session()
s.get("https://httpbin.org/cookies/set/foo/bar")
r = s.get("https://httpbin.org/cookies")
print(r.json())
```

### Asyncio Example

```python
import asyncio
from curl_cffi import AsyncSession

async with AsyncSession() as s:
    r = await s.get("https://example.com")
```

## Supported Impersonated Browsers

`curl_cffi` supports the browser versions available in the linked [curl-impersonate fork](https://github.com/lexiforest/curl-impersonate)
The following table lists some open source options. Refer to the original documentation for the most up-to-date and complete list, and details on `ja3` and `akamai` options for custom fingerprints.
