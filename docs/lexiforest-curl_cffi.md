`curl_cffi` is a Python binding for a [curl-impersonate fork](https://github.com/lexiforest/curl-impersonate) built with [cffi](https://cffi.readthedocs.io/en/latest/), allowing you to mimic browser behavior for web scraping, bypassing bot detection, and more.  For commercial support, visit [impersonate.pro](https://impersonate.pro).

## Key Features

*   **Browser Fingerprint Impersonation:**  Mimics TLS/JA3 and HTTP/2 fingerprints of various browsers (Chrome, Safari, Firefox, etc.) and even supports custom fingerprints.
*   **High Performance:** Significantly faster than `requests` and `httpx`, competitive with `aiohttp` and `pycurl`.  See [benchmarks](https://github.com/lexiforest/curl_cffi/tree/main/benchmark).
*   **Familiar API:** Uses a `requests`-like API for easy adoption.
*   **Pre-compiled:** No need to compile on your machine.
*   **Asynchronous Support:** Includes `asyncio` support with proxy rotation per request.
*   **HTTP/2 & HTTP/3 Support:** Supports both HTTP/2 and HTTP/3, unlike some other Python HTTP clients.
*   **WebSockets Support:** Supports WebSockets for real-time data retrieval.
*   **MIT Licensed:** Open-source and freely available for use.

Notes:
1.  For pycurl, you need an http/3 enabled libcurl to make it work, while curl_cffi packages libcurl-impersonate inside Python wheels.
2.  Since v0.11.4.

## Installation

Install `curl_cffi` using pip:

```bash
pip install curl_cffi --upgrade
```

This should work on Linux, macOS, and Windows out of the box. If you encounter issues, you might need to compile and install `curl-impersonate` first and set environment variables (e.g., `LD_LIBRARY_PATH`).

For beta releases:

```bash
pip install curl_cffi --upgrade --pre
```

For unstable versions from GitHub:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/lexiforest/curl_cffi/
cd curl_cffi
make preprocess
pip install .
```

**macOS users:** You might need to install dependencies:

```bash
brew install zstd nghttp2
```

## Usage Examples

### requests-like API (v0.10)

```python
import curl_cffi

# Mimic Chrome
r = curl_cffi.get("https://tls.browserleaks.com/json", impersonate="chrome")
print(r.json())

# Choose a specific Chrome version
r = curl_cffi.get("https://tls.browserleaks.com/json", impersonate="chrome124")

# Use proxies
proxies = {"https": "http://localhost:3128"}
r = curl_cffi.get("https://tls.browserleaks.com/json", impersonate="chrome", proxies=proxies)

proxies = {"https": "socks://localhost:3128"}
r = curl_cffi.get("https://tls.browserleaks.com/json", impersonate="chrome", proxies=proxies)
```

### Sessions

```python
s = curl_cffi.Session()
s.get("https://httpbin.org/cookies/set/foo/bar")
r = s.get("https://httpbin.org/cookies")
print(r.json())
# {'cookies': {'foo': 'bar'}}
```

### Supported Browsers
`curl_cffi` supports a wide variety of browser versions. For more details on browser support and commercial offerings, visit [impersonate.pro](https://impersonate.pro)

For more options, see the [docs on impersonation](https://curl-cffi.readthedocs.io/en/latest/impersonate.html).

### Asyncio

```python
from curl_cffi import AsyncSession
import asyncio

async with AsyncSession() as s:
    r = await s.get("https://example.com")
```

### WebSockets

```python
from curl_cffi import WebSocket

def on_message(ws: WebSocket, message: str | bytes):
    print(message)

ws = WebSocket(on_message=on_message)
ws.run_forever("wss://api.gemini.com/v1/marketdata/BTCUSD")
```

### Asyncio WebSockets

```python
import asyncio
from curl_cffi import AsyncSession

async with AsyncSession() as s:
    ws = await s.ws_connect("wss://echo.websocket.org")
    await asyncio.gather(*[ws.send_str("Hello, World!") for _ in range(10)])
    async for message in ws:
        print(message)
```
