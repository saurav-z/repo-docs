`curl_cffi` is the premier Python binding for the `curl-impersonate` fork, providing advanced features for web scraping and bypassing anti-bot measures. It leverages `cffi` for optimal performance and offers robust browser impersonation capabilities.  For commercial support, visit [impersonate.pro](https://impersonate.pro).

**Key Features:**

*   **Browser Impersonation:**  Impersonate a wide range of browsers (Chrome, Safari, Firefox, Edge, and more) including specific versions, to bypass anti-bot defenses.  Easily adapt to the latest browser versions and market share with a simple `impersonate` parameter.
*   **High Performance:** Significantly faster than standard Python HTTP clients like `requests` and `httpx`, rivaling the speed of `aiohttp` and `pycurl`.  See our [benchmarks](https://github.com/lexiforest/curl_cffi/tree/main/benchmark) for details.
*   **Familiar API:** Mimics the `requests` API for easy integration and a minimal learning curve.
*   **Asynchronous Support:**  Built-in `asyncio` support with proxy rotation for efficient, concurrent scraping.
*   **HTTP/2 and HTTP/3:** Full support for modern HTTP protocols, offering improved performance and compatibility.
*   **WebSockets:**  Robust support for both synchronous and asynchronous WebSockets.
*   **Customizable Fingerprints:**  Use custom JA3/TLS and HTTP/2 fingerprints to precisely control your requests.
*   **Pre-compiled:** No need to compile on your machine, making installation straightforward.
*   **MIT License:** Use it freely in your projects.

Notes:
1. For pycurl, you need an http/3 enabled libcurl to make it work, while curl_cffi packages libcurl-impersonate inside Python wheels.
2. Since v0.11.4.

**Installation:**

```bash
pip install curl_cffi --upgrade
```

For beta releases:

```bash
pip install curl_cffi --upgrade --pre
```

For unstable versions:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/lexiforest/curl_cffi/
cd curl_cffi
make preprocess
pip install .
```

On macOS, you may need to install these dependencies:

```bash
brew install zstd nghttp2
```

**Usage Examples:**

```python
import curl_cffi

# Basic GET request with Chrome impersonation
r = curl_cffi.get("https://tls.browserleaks.com/json", impersonate="chrome")
print(r.json())

# Using sessions
s = curl_cffi.Session()
s.get("https://httpbin.org/cookies/set/foo/bar")
print(s.cookies)
```

```python
# Asyncio Example
import asyncio
from curl_cffi import AsyncSession

async with AsyncSession() as s:
    r = await s.get("https://example.com")
    print(r.text)
```

**Supported Browsers**
