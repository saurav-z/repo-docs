`curl_cffi` provides a high-performance and flexible Python interface to the `curl-impersonate` fork, allowing you to mimic browser behavior and avoid bot detection. This makes it ideal for web scraping, API interaction, and other tasks where sophisticated HTTP requests are needed.

**Key Features:**

*   ‚úÖ **Browser Impersonation:**  Mimics TLS/JA3 and HTTP/2 fingerprints of various browsers (Chrome, Safari, Firefox, etc.) and their versions.
*   üöÄ **High Performance:** Significantly faster than `requests` and `httpx`, matching the speed of `aiohttp` and `pycurl`.  See [benchmarks](https://github.com/lexiforest/curl_cffi/tree/main/benchmark).
*   üêç **Familiar API:**  Offers a user-friendly API similar to `requests`, making it easy to learn and use.
*   üì¶ **Pre-compiled:** No need to compile on your machine; ready to use out-of-the-box.
*   üîÑ **Asynchronous Support:**  Includes `asyncio` support with proxy rotation for concurrent requests.
*   üåê **HTTP/2 & HTTP/3 Support:** Supports modern HTTP protocols, unlike some other libraries.
*   üîó **WebSocket Support:** Offers both synchronous and asynchronous WebSocket capabilities.
*   üõ°Ô∏è **MIT Licensed:**  Use and distribute freely.

## Usage

### requests-like

```python
import curl_cffi

# Basic GET request with Chrome impersonation
r = curl_cffi.get("https://tls.browserleaks.com/json", impersonate="chrome")
print(r.json())

# Example to use a socks proxy
proxies = {"https": "socks://localhost:3128"}
r = curl_cffi.get("https://tls.browserleaks.com/json", impersonate="chrome", proxies=proxies)

# To specify a browser version
r = curl_cffi.get("https://tls.browserleaks.com/json", impersonate="chrome124")

# Use a session to persist cookies across multiple requests
s = curl_cffi.Session()
s.get("https://httpbin.org/cookies/set/foo/bar")
r = s.get("https://httpbin.org/cookies")
print(r.json())
```

### Asyncio

```python
import asyncio
from curl_cffi import AsyncSession

async with AsyncSession() as s:
    r = await s.get("https://example.com")
```

### WebSockets

```python
from curl_cffi import WebSocket

def on_message(ws: WebSocket, message: str | bytes):
    print(message)

ws = WebSocket(on_message=on_message)
ws.run_forever("wss://api.gemini.com/v1/marketdata/BTCUSD")
```

### Asyncio WebSockets

```python
import asyncio
from curl_cffi import AsyncSession

async with AsyncSession() as s:
    ws = await s.ws_connect("wss://echo.websocket.org")
    await asyncio.gather(*[ws.send_str("Hello, World!") for _ in range(10)])
    async for message in ws:
        print(message)
```
