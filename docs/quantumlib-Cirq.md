## Key Features

Cirq offers powerful tools for quantum circuit development and simulation, particularly for noisy intermediate-scale quantum (NISQ) computers:

*   **Flexible Gate Definitions:** Define custom quantum gates with ease.
*   **Parameterized Circuits:** Build circuits using symbolic variables for greater flexibility.
*   **Circuit Manipulation:** Transform, compile, and optimize your circuits.
*   **Hardware Device Modeling:** Accurately model the behavior of quantum hardware.
*   **Noise Modeling:** Simulate the effects of noise in quantum systems.
*   **Built-in Simulators:** Utilize multiple simulators for circuit execution.
*   **High-Performance Simulation:** Integrate with [qsim](https://github.com/quantumlib/qsim) for optimized simulation.
*   **Interoperability:** Seamlessly integrate with [NumPy](https://numpy.org) and [SciPy](https://scipy.org).
*   **Cross-Platform Compatibility:** Works on Linux, macOS, Windows, and Google Colab.

## Installation

Cirq supports Python 3.11 and later.  For detailed installation instructions, please consult the [installation instructions](https://quantumai.google/cirq/start/install) in the Cirq documentation.

## Quick Start – “Hello Qubit” Example

Get started with Cirq by running this simple example:

```python
import cirq

# Pick a qubit.
qubit = cirq.GridQubit(0, 0)

# Create a circuit.
circuit = cirq.Circuit(
    cirq.X(qubit)**0.5,  # Square root of NOT.
    cirq.measure(qubit, key='m')  # Measurement.
)
print("Circuit:")
print(circuit)

# Simulate the circuit several times.
simulator = cirq.Simulator()
result = simulator.run(circuit, repetitions=20)
print("Results:")
print(result)
```

This will output a circuit representation and simulation results.
