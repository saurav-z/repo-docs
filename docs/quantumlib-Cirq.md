## Getting Started

### Installation

Cirq requires Python 3.11 or higher.  For detailed installation instructions, see the [Install](https://quantumai.google/cirq/start/install) section of the official documentation.

### Quick Start Example

Here's a simple "Hello Qubit" example to get you started:

```python
import cirq

# Pick a qubit.
qubit = cirq.GridQubit(0, 0)

# Create a circuit.
circuit = cirq.Circuit(
    cirq.X(qubit)**0.5,  # Square root of NOT.
    cirq.measure(qubit, key='m')  # Measurement.
)
print("Circuit:")
print(circuit)

# Simulate the circuit several times.
simulator = cirq.Simulator()
result = simulator.run(circuit, repetitions=20)
print("Results:")
print(result)
```

This will output a circuit representation and simulation results.
