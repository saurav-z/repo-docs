## What is Sentry?

Sentry is the comprehensive debugging platform empowering developers to detect, triage, and resolve software issues with unprecedented speed and accuracy. Sentry helps you fix code faster.

Sentry's core functionalities are built on these core pillars:

*   **Error Tracking:** Identify and resolve errors in real time.
*   **Performance Monitoring:** Optimize application performance with detailed insights.
*   **Code-Level Insights:** Understand the root cause of issues with comprehensive context.
*   **User Replays**: Watch a video of what the user saw and did leading up to the error.
