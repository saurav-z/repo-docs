# Sentry: The Premier Debugging Platform for Modern Development

*   **Error Tracking:** Automatically capture and analyze errors in real-time, providing detailed context for rapid resolution.
*   **Performance Monitoring:** Identify performance bottlenecks and optimize application speed and responsiveness.
*   **Distributed Tracing:**  Trace requests across services to pinpoint the source of performance issues and errors in distributed systems.
*   **Session Replay:** Record user sessions to understand the exact steps that led to an error or performance issue.
*   **User Insights:** Connect errors to users to prioritize and understand the impact of issues.
*   **Log Aggregation:**  Collect and analyze logs to provide a complete view of your application's health.
*   **Uptime Monitoring:** Get notified of downtime and ensure your application is always available.
