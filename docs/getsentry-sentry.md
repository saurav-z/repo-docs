# Sentry: Debugging Platform for Modern Development

**Sentry is the leading debugging platform that helps developers detect, trace, and resolve issues quickly and efficiently, improving application stability and user experience.**

Sentry empowers developers to build better software by providing comprehensive error tracking, performance monitoring, and user session replay capabilities.

## Key Features of Sentry:

*   **Performance Monitoring:** Identify performance bottlenecks and optimize application performance with transaction tracing, latency monitoring, and Apdex scores.
*   **Session Replay:** Replay user sessions to understand exactly what happened before an issue occurred, providing valuable context for debugging.
*   **Issue Grouping and Prioritization:** Automatically group similar errors and intelligently prioritize issues based on impact and frequency.
*   **Alerting and Notifications:** Get notified instantly when critical issues arise, ensuring rapid response and reduced downtime.
*   **Integrations:** Seamlessly integrate with popular development tools, including CI/CD pipelines, project management systems, and communication platforms.
