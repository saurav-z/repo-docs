# Sentry: The Debugging Platform to Detect, Trace, and Fix Issues Faster

**Sentry helps developers diagnose, understand, and resolve software errors, improving application performance and user experience.**

## Key Features of Sentry:

*   **Error Tracking:** Automatically capture and aggregate errors from your applications.
*   **Detailed Context:** Provides rich context around each error, including user information, environment details, and stack traces.
*   **Performance Monitoring:** Monitor application performance, identify bottlenecks, and optimize code.
*   **Distributed Tracing:** Trace requests across microservices to pinpoint the source of issues.
*   **Session Replay:** Record user sessions to understand how users interact with your application and reproduce issues.
*   **Log Aggregation:** Centralize and analyze logs for comprehensive troubleshooting.
*   **Uptime Monitoring:** Monitor the availability of your services and receive alerts for downtime.
*   **Integrations:** Integrate with your existing workflow tools such as Slack, Jira, and more.
