Key improvements and SEO considerations:

*   **Strong Headline:**  The main heading uses the keyword "Debugging Platform" directly, improving SEO.  The subheadline immediately after the logo includes "detect, trace, and resolve" which are strong keywords.
*   **Concise Hook:** The one-sentence hook clearly states Sentry's value proposition.
*   **Bulleted Key Features:**  Uses bullet points to highlight the core features, making the content easy to scan and digest. The bullet points use strong keywords such as "Error Tracking," "Performance Monitoring", "Distributed Tracing" and "Session Replay".
*   **Alt Text for Images:** Added alt text to the images for accessibility and SEO.
*   **Language/Framework Focus:** The SDK section highlights the breadth of language support.
*   **Resources Section:**  Maintains the original resources links.
*   **Clear Call to Action:** Added a link back to the original GitHub repository with clear text.
*   **Use of SEO optimized language:** Keywords such as "debugging", "error tracking", and "performance monitoring" are used throughout the document.
*   **Semantic HTML:**  Use of `<h2>` for key sections helps with SEO and content structure.
