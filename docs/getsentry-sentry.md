*   **Code-Level Context:**  Provides detailed stack traces, variable values, and environment information to help you pinpoint the root cause of issues.
*   **User Impact Analysis:**  Shows which users are affected by specific errors, helping prioritize critical issues.
*   **Real-time Alerts:**  Receive instant notifications when new errors occur or when performance degrades.
*   **Session Replay:** Replay user sessions to watch how a user interacted with your app and get additional debugging context.
