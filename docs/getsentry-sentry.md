## Stop chasing errors, start fixing them with Sentry.

Sentry is the leading debugging platform that empowers developers to detect, triage, and resolve software issues efficiently. 

### Key Features of Sentry:

*   **Contextual Information:** Provides rich context around each error, including user details, environment information, and code snippets, to streamline debugging.
*   **Performance Monitoring:** Identifies performance bottlenecks and slow transactions to improve application speed and user experience.
*   **Code Level Insights:** Integrates with your code to show you exactly where the problem is, making it easy to fix bugs.
*   **User Replays:** Record user sessions to quickly understand how a bug occurs from the user perspective.
*   **Integrations:** Seamlessly integrates with popular development tools and platforms.
