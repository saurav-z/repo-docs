# MaxText: High-Performance LLM Training Library

**Maximize your LLM training potential with MaxText, a powerful, open-source library for building and scaling large language models on TPUs and GPUs.**  ([See the original repository](https://github.com/AI-Hypercomputer/maxtext))

MaxText is a cutting-edge, open-source library written in pure Python/JAX, designed for high-performance, scalable Large Language Model (LLM) training. It's optimized for Google Cloud TPUs and GPUs.

**Key Features:**

*   **High Performance:** Achieves impressive Model FLOPs Utilization (MFU) and tokens/second, even on large clusters.
*   **Open Source:**  Leverage the flexibility to customize and adapt the library to meet your specific needs.
*   **Model Variety:** Supports a wide range of popular LLMs, including Gemma, Llama, DeepSeek, Qwen, and Mistral.
*   **Scalable Training:** Enables pre-training (up to tens of thousands of chips) and scalable post-training using techniques like Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) and Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO).
*   **JAX-Powered:** Utilizes the power of JAX and the XLA compiler for "optimization-free" performance.
*   **Easy to Get Started:** Provides clear documentation and tutorials for both research and production use cases.
*   **Multi-modal Support:** Supports multi-modal training for models like Gemma 3 and Llama 4 VLMs.

## Installation

Get started quickly by installing MaxText within a Python virtual environment.

### From PyPI (Recommended)

```bash
# 1. Install uv, a fast Python package installer
pip install uv

# 2. Install MaxText and its dependencies
uv pip install maxtext --resolution=lowest
install_maxtext_github_deps
```

> **Note:** The `install_maxtext_github_deps` command is temporarily required to install dependencies directly from GitHub that are not yet available on PyPI.

> **Note:** We highly recommend the `--resolution=lowest` flag. It instructs `uv` to install the specific, tested versions of dependencies defined by MaxText, rather than the latest available ones. This ensures a consistent and reproducible environment, which is critical for stable performance and for running benchmarks.

### From Source

```bash
# 1. Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/AI-Hypercomputer/maxtext.git
cd maxtext

# 2. Install dependencies in editable mode
pip install uv
uv pip install -e . --resolution=lowest
install_maxtext_github_deps
```

After installation, verify with `python3 -c "import MaxText"` and run training jobs with `python3 -m MaxText.train ...`.

## Use Cases

MaxText offers a flexible framework for both pre-training and post-training of LLMs.

*   **Pre-training:** Use MaxText as a reference implementation for building your own models, experimenting with configurations, and optimizing performance.
*   **Post-training:**  Fine-tune pre-trained models using techniques like SFT and GRPO with a scalable framework using Tunix.
