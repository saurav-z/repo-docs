# MaxText: Train and Fine-Tune Large Language Models at Scale

[<img src="https://github.com/AI-Hypercomputer/maxtext/actions/workflows/RunTests.yml/badge.svg" alt="MaxText Package Tests">](https://github.com/AI-Hypercomputer/maxtext/actions/workflows/build_and_test_maxtext.yml)

**MaxText empowers you to efficiently train and fine-tune cutting-edge large language models (LLMs) using Python, JAX, and Google Cloud TPUs and GPUs, offering high performance and scalability.**

MaxText is a high-performance, open-source LLM library and reference implementation built with pure Python and JAX, designed for training large language models on Google Cloud TPUs and GPUs. It provides a flexible and scalable framework for both pre-training and post-training LLMs, enabling researchers and engineers to build and deploy state-of-the-art models.

**Key Features:**

*   **High-Performance:** Achieves high Model FLOPs Utilization (MFU) and tokens/second from single host to very large clusters thanks to JAX and the XLA compiler.
*   **Open Source:** Free to use and customize for your LLM projects.
*   **Model Support:** Provides models from various vendors: Gemma, Llama, DeepSeek, Qwen, and Mistral.
*   **Pre-training & Post-training:** Supports both pre-training (up to tens of thousands of chips) and scalable post-training techniques like Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) and Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO).
*   **JAX-Based:** Built with JAX for automatic differentiation, GPU/TPU acceleration, and ease of use.
*   **Scalable:** Designed to scale from single host to very large clusters.

## Installation

Get started by installing MaxText within a Python virtual environment.

### From PyPI (Recommended)

```bash
# 1. Install uv, a fast Python package installer
pip install uv

# 2. Install MaxText and its dependencies
uv pip install maxtext --resolution=lowest
install_maxtext_github_deps
```

> **Note:** The `install_maxtext_github_deps` command is temporarily required to install dependencies directly from GitHub that are not yet available on PyPI.

> **Note:** The maxtext package contains a comprehensive list of all direct and transitive dependencies, with lower bounds, generated by [seed-env](https://github.com/google-ml-infra/actions/tree/main/python_seed_env). We highly recommend the `--resolution=lowest` flag. It instructs `uv` to install the specific, tested versions of dependencies defined by MaxText, rather than the latest available ones. This ensures a consistent and reproducible environment, which is critical for stable performance and for running benchmarks.

### From Source

```bash
# 1. Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/AI-Hypercomputer/maxtext.git
cd maxtext

# 2. Install dependencies in editable mode
pip install uv
uv pip install -e . --resolution=lowest
install_maxtext_github_deps
```

Verify installation: `python3 -c "import MaxText"` and run training jobs: `python3 -m MaxText.train ...`.

## ðŸ”¥ Latest News ðŸ”¥

*   [September 5, 2025] MaxText has moved to an `src` layout as part of [RESTRUCTURE.md](RESTRUCTURE.md). For existing environments, please run `pip install -e .` from MaxText root.
*   [August 13, 2025] The Qwen3 2507 MoE family of models is now supported: MoEs: 235B Thinking & 280B Coder as well as existing dense models: 0.6B, 4B, 8B, 14B, and 32B.
*   [July 27, 2025] Updated TFLOPS/s calculation ([PR](https://github.com/AI-Hypercomputer/maxtext/pull/1988)) to account for causal attention, dividing the attention flops in half. Accounted for sliding window and chunked attention reduced attention flops in [PR](https://github.com/AI-Hypercomputer/maxtext/pull/2009) and [PR](https://github.com/AI-Hypercomputer/maxtext/pull/2030). Changes impact large sequence configs, as explained in this [doc](https://github.com/AI-Hypercomputer/maxtext/blob/main/docs/guides/performance_metrics.md)
*   [July 16, 2025] We will be restructuring the MaxText repository for improved organization and clarity. Please review the [proposed structure](https://github.com/AI-Hypercomputer/maxtext/blob/main/RESTRUCTURE.md) and provide feedback.
*   [July 11, 2025] Multi-Token Prediction (MTP) training support\! Adds an auxiliary loss based on predicting multiple future tokens, inspired by [DeepSeek-V3 paper](https://arxiv.org/html/2412.19437v1), to enhance training efficiency.
*   [June 25, 2025] DeepSeek R1-0528 variant is now supported
*   [April 24, 2025] Llama 4 Maverick models are now supported

## Use Cases

MaxText is a versatile tool for both training and fine-tuning LLMs.

MaxText leverages [JAX AI libraries](https://docs.jaxstack.ai/en/latest/getting_started.html) and presents a cohesive and comprehensive demonstration of training at scale by using [Flax](https://flax.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) (neural networks), [Tunix](https://github.com/google/tunix) (post-training), [Orbax](https://orbax.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) (checkpointing), [Optax](https://optax.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) (optimization), and [Grain](https://google-grain.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) (dataloading).

In addition to pure text-based LLMs, we also support multi-modal training with Gemma 3 and Llama 4 VLMs.

### Pre-training

Use MaxText as a reference for experimentation. Fork and modify it to train your own models, whether small or large like DeepSeek-V3.

### Post-training

Use MaxText with Tunix for post-training your models. For RL, use vLLM for sampling and Pathways (soon) for multi-host.
