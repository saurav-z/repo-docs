# MaxText: High-Performance, Scalable LLM Training with JAX

**Maximize your LLM training potential with MaxText, a powerful, open-source library built in pure Python/JAX for efficient large language model training on Google Cloud TPUs and GPUs.**  [View the original repository](https://github.com/AI-Hypercomputer/maxtext)

**Key Features:**

*   **High-Performance & Scalable:** Achieve optimal Model FLOPs Utilization (MFU) and high tokens/second, from single host to large clusters.
*   **Open-Source & Flexible:**  Train a variety of models, experiment with new techniques, and adapt MaxText to your specific LLM projects.
*   **Wide Model Support:**  Pre-trained models available including Gemma, Llama, DeepSeek, Qwen, and Mistral.
*   **Pre-Training & Post-Training Support:** Utilize MaxText for pre-training (up to tens of thousands of chips) and scalable post-training using techniques like Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) and Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO).
*   **JAX-Powered:** Leverage the power of JAX and the XLA compiler for optimization-free performance.
*   **Comprehensive Ecosystem:** Integrated with essential JAX AI libraries including Flax, Tunix, Orbax, Optax, and Grain for end-to-end training workflows.
*   **Multi-Modal Capabilities:** Supports multi-modal training with select models like Gemma 3 and Llama 4 VLMs.

## Installation

MaxText is best installed inside a Python virtual environment.

### From PyPI (Recommended)

```bash
# 1. Install uv, a fast Python package installer
pip install uv

# 2. Install MaxText and its dependencies
uv pip install maxtext --resolution=lowest
install_maxtext_github_deps
```
> **Note:** The `install_maxtext_github_deps` command is temporarily required to install dependencies directly from GitHub that are not yet available on PyPI.

> **Note:** The maxtext package contains a comprehensive list of all direct and transitive dependencies, with lower bounds, generated by [seed-env](https://github.com/google-ml-infra/actions/tree/main/python_seed_env). We highly recommend the `--resolution=lowest` flag. It instructs `uv` to install the specific, tested versions of dependencies defined by MaxText, rather than the latest available ones. This ensures a consistent and reproducible environment, which is critical for stable performance and for running benchmarks.

### From Source

```bash
# 1. Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/AI-Hypercomputer/maxtext.git
cd maxtext

# 2. Install dependencies in editable mode
pip install uv
uv pip install -e . --resolution=lowest
install_maxtext_github_deps
```

## Use Cases

MaxText is designed to be the launching point for ambitious LLM projects. Here's how you can leverage its capabilities:

### Pre-training

*   Use MaxText as a reference implementation for experimentation and model design.
*   Fork and modify MaxText to train your models, from small dense models to large MoEs.
*   Utilize opinionated implementations for optimized performance in sharding, quantization, and checkpointing.

### Post-training

*   Use MaxText's scalable framework using Tunix to post-train proprietary or open-source models.
*   Leverage vLLM for sampling and Pathways (soon) for multi-host RL training.
