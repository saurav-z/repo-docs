## Features and Diagnostics

### Collect Stack Traces
Configure `collect_stack_trace`, `stack_trace_to_cloud` and `stack_trace_interval_seconds` in `MaxText/configs/base.yml` to debug issues by capturing and storing stack traces.

### Ahead of Time Compilation (AOT)
Compile your training runs ahead of time with the `train_compile.py` tool for TPUs and GPUs.  This can help with:

*   Identifying OOM issues.
*   Faster startup and restart times.
