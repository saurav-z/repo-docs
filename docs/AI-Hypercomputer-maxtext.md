[Visit the original repository on GitHub](https://github.com/AI-Hypercomputer/maxtext).

**Key Features:**

*   **High Performance:** Achieves high Model FLOPs Utilization (MFU) and tokens/second, optimized for speed.
*   **Scalability:** Supports training on single hosts to very large clusters of TPUs and GPUs.
*   **Open-Source:** Built on pure Python/JAX, fostering community collaboration and customization.
*   **Model Library:** Provides a diverse selection of models, including Gemma, Llama, DeepSeek, Qwen, and Mistral, ready for pre-training and post-training.
*   **Pre-training & Post-training Support:** Offers comprehensive support for both pre-training and post-training techniques, including Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) and Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO).
*   **Modular and Flexible:** Designed for easy experimentation, modification, and integration into your LLM projects.
*   **Comprehensive Ecosystem:** Leverages JAX AI libraries, including Flax, Tunix, Orbax, Optax, and Grain for a complete training solution.

## Installation

Get started with MaxText using either PyPI or by installing from source.

### From PyPI (Recommended)

This method offers the easiest installation for the latest stable release.

```bash
# 1. Install uv, a fast Python package installer
pip install uv

# 2. Install MaxText and its dependencies
uv pip install maxtext --resolution=lowest
install_maxtext_github_deps
```

> **Note:** The `install_maxtext_github_deps` command is required to install dependencies directly from GitHub that are not yet available on PyPI.

> **Note:** We recommend using the `--resolution=lowest` flag for `uv` to ensure a consistent and reproducible environment, critical for stable performance and benchmark repeatability.

### From Source

Install from source for access to the latest features and to contribute to the project.

```bash
# 1. Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/AI-Hypercomputer/maxtext.git
cd maxtext

# 2. Install dependencies in editable mode
pip install uv
uv pip install -e . --resolution=lowest
install_maxtext_github_deps
```

Verify installation with `python3 -c "import MaxText"` and run training jobs with `python3 -m MaxText.train ...`.

## Use Cases

MaxText offers a versatile platform for both pre-training and post-training LLMs.  It empowers you to build, experiment, and deploy high-performance models at scale.

### Pre-training

Utilize MaxText as a robust reference implementation for your custom LLM projects. Customize and train your models, from small dense models (Llama 8B) to large MoEs (DeepSeek-V3) and fine-tune configurations for optimal performance.

MaxText provides opinionated implementations across various performance dimensions such as: sharding, quantization, and checkpointing.

### Post-training

Leverage MaxText's scalable framework for post-training models, whether proprietary or open-source. Utilize Tunix for your projects. For RL (like GRPO), we leverage vLLM for sampling and Pathways (soon) for multi-host.

Explore a variety of models and techniques to fine-tune the perfect model for your specific use case.

*   [SFT](https://github.com/AI-Hypercomputer/maxtext/blob/main/end_to_end/tpu/llama3.1/8b/run_sft.sh) (Supervised Fine Tuning)
*   [GRPO](https://maxtext.readthedocs.io/en/latest/tutorials/grpo.html) (Group Relative Policy Optimization)

### Model Library

MaxText aims to provide the best OSS models, whether as a reference implementation, or to post-train and then serve with vLLM.
