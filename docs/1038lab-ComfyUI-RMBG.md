    *   Includes real-time background replacement for seamless integration.
    *   Batch processing support for efficient workflow.
*   **Precise Object Segmentation:**
    *   Text-prompted object detection using SAM, SAM2, and GroundingDINO.
    *   Supports both tag-style and natural language prompts for flexible object selection.
    *   Provides adjustable parameters for refining segmentation accuracy.
*   **Enhanced Edge Detection:**
    *   Improved edge quality and detail preservation.
    *   Optimized edge detection for sharper results.
*   **Comprehensive Model Support:**
    *   Includes a wide array of pre-trained models for diverse use cases.

## Usage

### 1. RMBG Node (Background Removal)

1.  Load the `RMBG (Remove Background)` node from the `ðŸ§ªAILab/ðŸ§½RMBG` category.
2.  Connect an image to the input.
3.  Select a model from the dropdown menu.
4.  Adjust parameters as needed (optional).
5.  Outputs: Processed image and a binary mask.

### 2. Segment Node (Object Segmentation)

1.  Load the `Segment (RMBG)` node from the `ðŸ§ªAILab/ðŸ§½RMBG` category.
2.  Connect an image to the input.
3.  Enter a text prompt (tag-style or natural language).
4.  Select models (SAM, GroundingDINO).
5.  Adjust parameters for precision.
