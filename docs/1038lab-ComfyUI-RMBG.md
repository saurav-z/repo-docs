## Installation

Choose your preferred installation method:

1.  **ComfyUI Manager:** Search for `Comfyui-RMBG` and install directly through the ComfyUI Manager.
2.  **Manual Clone:**
    ```bash
    cd ComfyUI/custom_nodes
    git clone https://github.com/1038lab/ComfyUI-RMBG
    ```
3.  **Comfy CLI:**
    ```bash
    comfy node install ComfyUI-RMBG
    ```

    *   **Important:** After installation, ensure you install the required packages:
        ```bash
        ./ComfyUI/python_embeded/python -m pip install -r requirements.txt
        ```
        (or use your system's Python if the embedded one doesn't work)

4.  **Model Downloads:** The models are automatically downloaded upon first use.  If manual download is needed, see the model links in the [original README](https://github.com/1038lab/ComfyUI-RMBG).

## Usage

### 1. RMBG Node (Background Removal)

*   Load the `RMBG (Remove Background)` node from the `üß™AILab/üßΩRMBG` category.
*   Connect an image to the input.
*   Select a model from the dropdown menu.
*   Adjust optional parameters for fine-tuning (see below).
*   Outputs: Processed image (with background removal) and a mask.

### 2. Segment Node (Object Segmentation)

*   Load the `Segment (RMBG)` node from the `üß™AILab/üßΩRMBG` category.
*   Connect an image to the input.
*   Enter a text prompt (tag-style or natural language).
*   Select the desired model (SAM, GroundingDINO, SAM2).
*   Adjust parameters as needed for optimal results.

### Optional Settings: Enhance Your Results

| Setting                  | Description                                                                | Tip                                                                                                  |
| ------------------------ | -------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Sensitivity              | Controls mask detection strength.  Higher = stricter.                        | Adjust based on image complexity.  Default: 0.5.                                                   |
| Processing Resolution    | Controls detail and memory usage.                                           | Range: 256-2048.  Default: 1024.  Higher = more detail, more memory.                             |
| Mask Blur                | Blurs mask edges.                                                           | Default: 0.  Experiment with 1-5 for smoother edges.                                                |
| Mask Offset              | Expands or shrinks mask boundary.                                           | Default: 0.  Fine-tune between -10 and 10.                                                           |
