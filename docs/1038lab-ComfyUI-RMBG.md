    *   `ComfyUI/models/RMBG/BEN`
    *   `ComfyUI/models/RMBG/BEN2`
    *   `ComfyUI/models/RMBG/BiRefNet-HR`
    *   `ComfyUI/models/SAM`
    *   `ComfyUI/models/sam2`
    *   `ComfyUI/models/grounding-dino`
    *   `ComfyUI/models/RMBG/segformer_clothes`
    *   `ComfyUI/models/RMBG/segformer_fashion`
    *   `ComfyUI/models/RMBG/BiRefNet`
    *   `ComfyUI/models/RMBG/SDMatte`

## Usage

### RMBG Node

1.  Load the `RMBG (Remove Background)` node from the `üß™AILab/üßΩRMBG` category.
2.  Connect an image to the input.
3.  Select a model from the dropdown menu.
4.  Adjust parameters as needed (optional):

    *   **Sensitivity:** Adjust background removal sensitivity (0.0-1.0).
    *   **Processing Resolution:** Controls image detail and memory usage (256-2048).
    *   **Mask Blur:** Smooths mask edges (0-64).
    *   **Mask Offset:** Expands or shrinks mask boundaries (-20 to 20).
    *   **Background:** Choose output background color (Alpha, Black, White, Green, Blue, Red).
    *   **Invert Output:** Flips mask and image output.
    *   **Refine Foreground:** Use Fast Foreground Color Estimation to optimize transparent background.
    *   **Performance Optimization:** Properly setting options can enhance performance when processing multiple images.

5.  Get two outputs:
    *   IMAGE: Processed image with the selected background.
    *   MASK: Binary mask of the foreground.

### Segment Node

1.  Load `Segment (RMBG)` from `üß™AILab/üßΩRMBG`.
2.  Connect an image.
3.  Enter a text prompt (tag-style or natural language).
4.  Select SAM or GroundingDINO models.
5.  Adjust parameters as needed (Threshold, Mask blur, Offset, Background color).

## Troubleshooting
*   401 error when initializing GroundingDINO / missing `models/sam2`:
    - Delete `%USERPROFILE%\.cache\huggingface\token` (and `%USERPROFILE%\.huggingface\token` if present)
    - Ensure no `HF_TOKEN`/`HUGGINGFACE_TOKEN` env vars are set
    - Re-run; public repos download anonymously (no login required)
*   Preview shows "Required input is missing: images":
    - Ensure image outputs are connected and upstream nodes ran successfully
