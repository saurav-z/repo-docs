### Model Downloads

*   The models will be automatically downloaded to the appropriate folders (`ComfyUI/models/RMBG/`, `ComfyUI/models/SAM/`, etc.) when you first use the custom nodes.
*   If you prefer manual download, find the links in the original README under "Manually download the models:".

## Usage

### RMBG Node

1.  Load the `RMBG (Remove Background)` node from the `üß™AILab/üßΩRMBG` category.
2.  Connect an image to the input.
3.  Select a model from the dropdown menu.
4.  Adjust parameters as needed (optional).
5.  Get two outputs:
    *   IMAGE: Processed image with transparent, black, white, green, blue, or red background.
    *   MASK: Binary mask of the foreground.

### Segment Node

1.  Load the `Segment (RMBG)` node from the `üß™AILab/üßΩRMBG` category.
2.  Connect an image to the input.
3.  Enter a text prompt (tag-style or natural language).
4.  Select SAM or GroundingDINO models.
5.  Adjust parameters as needed (Threshold, Mask blur, Mask offset, and Background).

## Troubleshooting (short)

*   **401 error initializing GroundingDINO/missing models:** Delete the hugging face cache and try again.
*   **"Required input is missing" preview:** Ensure image outputs are connected.
