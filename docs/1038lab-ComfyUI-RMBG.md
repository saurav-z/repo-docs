# ComfyUI-RMBG: Unleash Precise Image Background Removal and Segmentation

**Effortlessly remove backgrounds, segment objects, and refine images with the ComfyUI-RMBG custom node, powered by cutting-edge AI models.**  Access the original repo [here](https://github.com/1038lab/ComfyUI-RMBG).

## Key Features

*   **Advanced Background Removal:** Utilize a suite of models including RMBG-2.0, INSPYRENET, BEN, BEN2, and BiRefNet for high-quality background removal.
*   **Precise Object Segmentation:** Employ text prompts with SAM and GroundingDINO to segment objects and refine masks.
*   **SAM2 Segmentation:** Leverage the latest SAM2 models (Tiny/Small/Base+/Large) for accurate text-prompted segmentation.
*   **Clothes/Fashion Segmentation:** Dedicated nodes for intelligent clothes and fashion segmentation.
*   **Real-time Background Replacement:** Seamlessly integrate and replace backgrounds.
*   **Enhanced Edge Detection:** Improve accuracy with enhanced edge detection for more natural results.
*   **Image and Mask Tools:** Additional utilities to help refine and combine your images and masks.

## Latest Updates

## Usage

### RMBG Node

1.  Load the `RMBG (Remove Background)` node from the `üß™AILab/üßΩRMBG` category.
2.  Connect an image to the input.
3.  Select a model from the dropdown menu.
4.  Adjust optional parameters for optimal results.
5.  Get two outputs: the processed image (with transparency, black, white, green, blue, or red background) and the corresponding mask.

### Segment Node

1.  Load the `Segment (RMBG)` node from the `üß™AILab/üßΩRMBG` category.
2.  Connect an image to the input.
3.  Enter a text prompt (tag-style or natural language).
4.  Select SAM or GroundingDINO models.
5.  Adjust parameters such as threshold, mask blur, and offset.

## Optional Settings and Tips

*   **Sensitivity:** Adjusts mask detection strength.
*   **Processing Resolution:** Controls detail and memory usage.
*   **Mask Blur:** Smooths mask edges.
*   **Mask Offset:** Expands/shrinks mask boundaries.
*   **Background:** Select output color.
*   **Invert Output:** Flip mask and image output.
*   **Refine Foreground:** Fast foreground color estimation.
*   **Performance Optimization:** Optimize settings for processing multiple images.

## Models

*   RMBG-2.0
*   INSPYRENET
*   BEN
*   BEN2
*   BiRefNet Models
*   SAM
*   SAM2
*   GroundingDINO

**(See original README "About Models" for comprehensive details on the capabilities of each model.)**

## Requirements

*   ComfyUI
*   Python 3.10+
*   Required packages (automatically installed).

## Troubleshooting

*   **401 error/missing `models/sam2`:** Delete `~/.cache/huggingface/token` (and `~/.huggingface/token`). Re-run.
*   **"Required input is missing" preview:** Ensure image outputs are connected and preceding nodes are executed successfully.
