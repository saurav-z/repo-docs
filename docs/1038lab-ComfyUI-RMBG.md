## Model Downloads

*   Models are automatically downloaded upon first use.
*   Manual download options are provided for each model family (RMBG-2.0, INSPYRENET, BEN, BEN2, BiRefNet, SAM, SAM2, GroundingDINO, SDMatte, Clothes Segment, Fashion Segment) from Hugging Face.  Detailed download instructions and links are in the original README.

## Usage

### RMBG Node

1.  Load the `RMBG (Remove Background)` node from the `ðŸ§ªAILab/ðŸ§½RMBG` category.
2.  Connect your input image.
3.  Select a model from the dropdown.
4.  Adjust parameters as needed (see Tips below).
5.  Get image and mask outputs.

### Optional Settings :bulb: Tips

| Optional Settings       | :memo: Description                                                           | :bulb: Tips                                                                                   |
| ----------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Sensitivity**         | Adjusts mask detection strength. Higher values for stricter detection.       | Default: 0.5.  Adjust based on image complexity; more complex images may need higher sensitivity. |
| **Processing Resolution** | Controls image processing resolution, affecting detail and memory usage. | Choose between 256-2048, default is 1024.  Higher res = better detail, more memory. |
| **Mask Blur**           | Controls mask edge blurring, reducing jaggedness.                             | Default: 0.  Try 1-5 for smoother edges.                                                      |
| **Mask Offset**         | Expands/shrinks mask boundary. Positive expands, negative shrinks.              | Default: 0.  Fine-tune between -10 and 10 based on image.                                      |
| **Background**          | Choose output background color | Alpha (transparent background) Black, White, Green, Blue, Red |
| **Invert Output**      | Flip mask and image output | Invert both image and mask output |
| **Refine Foreground** | Use Fast Foreground Color Estimation to optimize transparent background | Enable for better edge quality and transparency handling |
| **Performance Optimization** | Properly setting options can enhance performance when processing multiple images. | If memory allows, consider increasing `process_res` and `mask_blur` values for better results, but be mindful of memory usage. |

### Segment Node

1.  Load `Segment (RMBG)` from `ðŸ§ªAILab/ðŸ§½RMBG`.
2.  Connect an image.
3.  Enter a text prompt (tag-style or natural language).
4.  Select SAM or GroundingDINO models.
5.  Adjust parameters: Threshold, Mask blur, offset, and Background color.
