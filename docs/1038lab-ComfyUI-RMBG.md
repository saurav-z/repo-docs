## Installation

Choose your preferred installation method:

*   **ComfyUI Manager:** Search for `ComfyUI-RMBG` and install directly.
*   **Clone Repository:**
    1.  Navigate to your ComfyUI custom\_nodes directory: `cd ComfyUI/custom_nodes`
    2.  Clone the repository: `git clone https://github.com/1038lab/ComfyUI-RMBG`
    3.  Install dependencies:  `./ComfyUI/python_embeded/python -m pip install -r requirements.txt` (or use your ComfyUI's embedded Python)
*   **Comfy CLI:**  Use the command `comfy node install ComfyUI-RMBG`, then install requirements.

## Model Downloads

Models are automatically downloaded upon first use.  You can also manually download them and place them in the appropriate folders.  Links to model locations are listed in the original README.

## Usage

### RMBG Node

1.  Load the `RMBG (Remove Background)` node from the `ðŸ§ªAILab/ðŸ§½RMBG` category.
2.  Connect an image input.
3.  Select a model.
4.  Adjust parameters as needed.
5.  Outputs: Processed image (with a transparent, black, white, green, blue, or red background) and a foreground mask.

### Segment Node

1.  Load the `Segment (RMBG)` node from the `ðŸ§ªAILab/ðŸ§½RMBG` category.
2.  Connect an image input.
3.  Enter a text prompt (tag-style or natural language).
4.  Select SAM or GroundingDINO models.
5.  Adjust parameters (threshold, mask blur, mask offset, background).

| Processing Resolution | Controls image processing resolution.                                             | Balance detail and memory usage.  Higher resolutions = more detail, but more memory.                    |
| Mask Blur            | Blurs mask edges.                                                                  | Set between 1-5 for smoother edges.                                                                    |
| Mask Offset          | Expands/shrinks the mask boundary.                                                | Adjust between -10 and 10 for fine-tuning.                                                             |

| Invert Output        | Inverts the mask and image output.                                                 | If you want the background, use the invert.                                                             |

| Optimize  | Optimize the model if you have a GPU                                          | Consider increasing `process_res` and `mask_blur` values for better results, but be mindful of memory usage. |
