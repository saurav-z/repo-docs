### Optional Settings :bulb: Tips

| Setting                  | Description                                                                | Tips                                                                                      |
| :----------------------- | :------------------------------------------------------------------------- | :---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Sensitivity**          | Adjusts mask detection strength.                                        | Higher for complex images.                                                              |
| **Processing Resolution** | Controls image resolution.                                               | Balance detail and memory usage (256-2048).                                              |
| **Mask Blur**            | Blurs mask edges.                                                        | Values between 1 and 5 are recommended for smoother edges.                                 |
| **Mask Offset**          | Expands/shrinks mask boundary.                                             | Fine-tune between -10 and 10.                                                            |
| **Background**           | Choose output background color                                          | Alpha (transparent), Black, White, Green, Blue, Red.                                       |
| **Invert Output**        | Flips image and mask output.                                             | Invert both image and mask output                                                       |
| **Refine Foreground**    | Use Fast Foreground Color Estimation to optimize transparent background   | Enable for better edge quality and transparency handling                                  |
| **Performance Optimization** | Setting the options can enhance performance when processing multiple images. | If memory allows, consider increasing `process_res` and `mask_blur` values for better results, but be mindful of memory usage.                                                            |

### Basic Usage

1.  Load `RMBG (Remove Background)` node from the `ðŸ§ªAILab/ðŸ§½RMBG` category
2.  Connect an image to the input
3.  Select a model from the dropdown menu
4.  select the parameters as needed (optional)
3.  Get two outputs:
    *   IMAGE: Processed image with transparent, black, white, green, blue, or red background
    *   MASK: Binary mask of the foreground

### Segment Node

1.  Load the `Segment (RMBG)` node from the `ðŸ§ªAILab/ðŸ§½RMBG` category.
2.  Connect an image to the input.
3.  Enter a text prompt (tag-style or natural language).
4.  Select SAM and GroundingDINO models.
5.  Adjust parameters: Threshold (0.25-0.55), Mask blur, Mask offset, and background color.

## Troubleshooting

*   **401 Errors/Missing Models:** Delete cache token (`%USERPROFILE%\.cache\huggingface\token`), ensure no `HF_TOKEN`/`HUGGINGFACE_TOKEN` env vars, and re-run. Public repos download anonymously.
*   **Missing Images:** Ensure image outputs are connected and upstream nodes executed successfully.
