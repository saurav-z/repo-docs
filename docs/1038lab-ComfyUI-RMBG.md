### 4. Model Download

*   **Automatic:** The necessary models will be downloaded automatically to the `ComfyUI/models/RMBG/` folder upon first use.
*   **Manual (if automatic download fails or for specific models):** Download models from the links provided in the original README and place them in the appropriate folders within your ComfyUI `models` directory (e.g., `ComfyUI/models/RMBG/RMBG-2.0`, `ComfyUI/models/SAM`).
    *   Specific model links and directory structures are detailed in the original README's "Installation" section.

## Usage

### RMBG Node

1.  Load the `RMBG (Remove Background)` node from the `ðŸ§ªAILab/ðŸ§½RMBG` category in ComfyUI.
2.  Connect an image to the input.
3.  Select a model from the dropdown menu.
4.  Adjust parameters (optional, see below).
5.  The node provides two outputs:
    *   `IMAGE`: Processed image with a transparent, black, white, green, blue, or red background.
    *   `MASK`: A binary mask of the foreground.

### Optional Settings: Tips

| Setting                 | Description                                                                | Tip                                                                                                           |
| :---------------------- | :------------------------------------------------------------------------- | :------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| **Sensitivity**         | Adjusts mask detection strength. Higher = stricter detection.           | Default: 0.5. Adjust based on image complexity.                                                              |
| **Processing Resolution** | Controls the resolution, affecting detail and memory usage.              | Choose between 256-2048 (default 1024). Higher = more detail, more memory.                                  |
| **Mask Blur**           | Blurs mask edges to reduce jaggedness.                                    | Default: 0. Try 1-5 for smoother edges.                                                                     |
| **Mask Offset**         | Expands/shrinks the mask boundary.                                        | Default: 0. Fine-tune between -10 and 10.                                                                  |
| **Background**          | Choose output background color.                                            | Select: Alpha, Black, White, Green, Blue, or Red.                                                            |
| **Invert Output**       | Flips mask and image output.                                             | Inverts both image and mask output.                                                                          |
| **Refine Foreground**   | Uses Fast Foreground Color Estimation for optimized transparency.       | Enable for better edge quality and transparency handling.                                                    |
| **Performance Optimization** | Enhances performance when processing multiple images.                  | Consider increasing `process_res` and `mask_blur` if memory allows.                                             |

### Basic Usage

1.  Load `Segment (RMBG)` node.
2.  Connect an image.
3.  Enter a text prompt (tag-style or natural language).
