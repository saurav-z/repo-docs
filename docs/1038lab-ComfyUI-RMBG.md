## Usage

1.  **RMBG Node (Background Removal):** Load the `üß™AILab/üßΩRMBG` node, connect an image, select a model, and adjust parameters such as sensitivity, processing resolution, mask blur, offset, and background color.
2.  **Segment Node (Object Segmentation):** Load the `üß™AILab/üßΩRMBG` node, connect an image, enter a text prompt, and select SAM or GroundingDINO. Adjust parameters like threshold, mask blur, offset, and background color.

### Basic Node Parameters

*   `sensitivity`: (0.0-1.0) - Controls the background removal sensitivity.
*   `process_res`: (512-2048, step 128) - Processing resolution.
*   `mask_blur`: (0-64) - Blur amount for the mask.
*   `mask_offset`: (-20 to 20) - Adjusts mask edges.
*   `background`:  Choose output background color.
*   `invert_output`: Flip mask and image output.
*   `optimize`: Toggle model optimization.
