## Usage

### RMBG Node

1.  Load `RMBG (Remove Background)` node from the `ðŸ§ªAILab/ðŸ§½RMBG` category.
2.  Connect an image to the input.
3.  Select a model from the dropdown menu.
4.  Adjust optional parameters as needed (see below).
5.  Receive two outputs:
    *   IMAGE: Processed image with a transparent, black, white, green, blue, or red background.
    *   MASK: Binary mask of the foreground.

### Optional Settings :bulb: Tips

| Optional Settings    | :memo: Description                                                           | :bulb: Tips                                                                                   |
|----------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Sensitivity**      | Adjusts the strength of mask detection. Higher values result in stricter detection. | Default value is 0.5. Adjust based on image complexity; more complex images may require higher sensitivity. |
| **Processing Resolution** | Controls the processing resolution of the input image, affecting detail and memory usage. | Choose a value between 256 and 2048, with a default of 1024. Higher resolutions provide better detail but increase memory consumption. |
| **Mask Blur**        | Controls the amount of blur applied to the mask edges, reducing jaggedness. | Default value is 0. Try setting it between 1 and 5 for smoother edge effects.                    |
| **Mask Offset**      | Allows for expanding or shrinking the mask boundary. Positive values expand the boundary, while negative values shrink it. | Default value is 0. Adjust based on the specific image, typically fine-tuning between -10 and 10. |
| **Background**      | Choose output background color | Alpha (transparent background) Black, White, Green, Blue, Red |
| **Invert Output**      | Flip mask and image output | Invert both image and mask output |
| **Refine Foreground** | Use Fast Foreground Color Estimation to optimize transparent background | Enable for better edge quality and transparency handling |
| **Performance Optimization** | Properly setting options can enhance performance when processing multiple images. | If memory allows, consider increasing `process_res` and `mask_blur` values for better results, but be mindful of memory usage. |

### Basic Usage

1.  Load the `RMBG (Remove Background)` node from the `ðŸ§ªAILab/ðŸ§½RMBG` category.
2.  Connect an image to the input.
3.  Select a model from the dropdown menu.
4.  Get two outputs:
    *   IMAGE: Processed image with transparent, black, white, green, blue, or red background
    *   MASK: Binary mask of the foreground

### Segment Node

1.  Load `Segment (RMBG)` node from the `ðŸ§ªAILab/ðŸ§½RMBG` category.
2.  Connect an image to the input.
3.  Enter text prompt (tag-style or natural language).
4.  Select SAM and GroundingDINO models.
5.  Adjust parameters as needed:
    *   Threshold: 0.25-0.35 for broad detection, 0.45-0.55 for precision.
    *   Mask blur and offset for edge refinement.
    *   Background color options.

## Troubleshooting

*   **401 error when initializing GroundingDINO / missing `models/sam2`:**  Delete the huggingface token and re-run.
*   **Preview shows "Required input is missing: images":** Ensure image outputs are connected and upstream nodes ran successfully
