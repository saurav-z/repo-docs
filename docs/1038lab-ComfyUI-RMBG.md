## Optional Settings & Tips

| Setting               | Description                                                        | Tips                                                                                                   |
| --------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Sensitivity           | Controls mask detection strength.                                | Adjust based on image complexity.  Higher values for complex images.                               |
| Processing Resolution | Controls processing resolution.                                    | Choose between 256 and 2048. Higher resolutions = better detail but more memory usage.               |
| Mask Blur             | Blurs mask edges.                                                  | 1-5 for smoother edges.                                                                                |
| Mask Offset           | Expands or shrinks mask boundary.                                 | Fine-tune between -10 and 10.                                                                          |
| Background            | Choose output background color                                     | Alpha (transparent background) Black, White, Green, Blue, Red |
| Invert Output         | Flip mask and image output                                     | Invert both image and mask output |
| Refine Foreground     | Use Fast Foreground Color Estimation to optimize transparent background | Enable for better edge quality and transparency handling |
| Performance Optimization | Optimize the performance of the node                                     | If memory allows, consider increasing `process_res` and `mask_blur` values for better results, but be mindful of memory usage. |

## Troubleshooting

*   **401 Error/Missing models:** Delete cache (`%USERPROFILE%\.cache\huggingface\token` and `%USERPROFILE%\.huggingface\token`), and rerun.
*   **"Required input is missing: images":**  Ensure image outputs are connected and upstream nodes ran successfully.
