## Optional Settings

| Setting                 | Description                                                                 | Tips                                                                                                                      |
| :---------------------- | :-------------------------------------------------------------------------- | :------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| **Sensitivity**         | Adjusts mask detection strength. Higher values for stricter detection.       | Default: 0.5. Adjust based on image complexity.                                                                           |

| **Mask Blur**           | Blurs mask edges for smoother results.                                         | Default: 0. Recommended: 1-5.                                                                                             |
| **Mask Offset**         | Expands or shrinks mask boundaries.                                          | Default: 0. Fine-tune between -10 and 10.                                                                                 |
| **Background**          | Select the desired output background color.                                 | Choose from: Alpha, Black, White, Green, Blue, Red.                                                                        |
| **Invert Output**       | Flips mask and image output.                                                 | Inverts both the image and mask.                                                                                           |
| **Refine Foreground**   | Uses Fast Foreground Color Estimation to optimize transparency.              | Enable for improved edge quality and transparency.                                                                        |
| **Performance Optimization** | Fine-tune settings for multiple image processing. | Consider increasing `process_res` and `mask_blur` with enough memory, but be mindful of memory usage. |
