*   **Text-Prompted Object Segmentation:**  Segment objects using text prompts with SAM and GroundingDINO models, supporting both tag-style and natural language inputs.
*   **SAM2 Integration:** Leverage the latest SAM2 models for high-quality, text-prompted segmentation with Tiny, Small, Base+, and Large options.
*   **Face, Clothes, and Fashion Segmentation:** Specialized nodes for detailed segmentation of facial features, clothing, and fashion elements.
*   **Real-time Background Replacement & Edge Refinement:**  Enhanced edge detection and real-time background replacement for improved accuracy.
*   **Flexible Image Handling:** Supports direct image loading from local paths or URLs, and batch processing for efficient workflows.
*   **Model Selection:** Download and utilize a variety of models from huggingface.co, including models for various tasks.
