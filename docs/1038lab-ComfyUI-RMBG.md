## Usage

### 1.  RMBG Node (Background Removal)

*   Load the `RMBG (Remove Background)` node from the `ðŸ§ªAILab/ðŸ§½RMBG` category.
*   Connect an image to the input.
*   Select a model.
*   Adjust optional settings.
*   Get the processed image and mask outputs.

### Optional Settings and Tips

| Setting                 | Description                                                                     | Tips                                                                                                          |
| :---------------------- | :------------------------------------------------------------------------------ | :------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Sensitivity             | Controls mask detection strength.                                             | Adjust based on image complexity (default: 0.5).                                                            |
| Processing Resolution   | Controls detail and memory usage.                                             | 256-2048 (default: 1024). Higher values = more detail, higher memory.                                        |
| Mask Blur               | Softens mask edges.                                                            | Try values between 1 and 5.                                                                                 |
| Mask Offset             | Expands/shrinks the mask boundary.                                              | Experiment between -10 and 10.                                                                                |
| Background              | Choose output background color. | Alpha (transparent background) Black, White, Green, Blue, Red |
| Invert Output           | Flip mask and image output | Invert both image and mask output |
| Refine Foreground          | Use Fast Foreground Color Estimation to optimize transparent background | Enable for better edge quality and transparency handling |
| Performance Optimization | Properly setting options can enhance performance when processing multiple images. | If memory allows, consider increasing `process_res` and `mask_blur` values for better results, but be mindful of memory usage. |


### 2. Segment Node (Object Segmentation)

*   Load the `Segment (RMBG)` node from the `ðŸ§ªAILab/ðŸ§½RMBG` category.
*   Connect an image.
*   Enter a text prompt (tag-style or natural language).
*   Select SAM or GroundingDINO models.
*   Adjust parameters: Threshold (0.25-0.55), Mask blur, and Offset.

## Troubleshooting

*   Refer to the original README for troubleshooting common issues, such as 401 errors and missing input errors.
