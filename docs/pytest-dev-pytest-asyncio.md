# pytest-asyncio: Effortlessly Test Asynchronous Python Code

**Supercharge your Python testing with pytest-asyncio, the pytest plugin that simplifies testing code utilizing the asyncio library.**  For more in-depth information, please visit the [original repository](https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest-asyncio).

## Key Features of pytest-asyncio:

*   **Seamless Asyncio Integration:**  Enables direct testing of coroutines within your pytest test functions.
*   **Await Support:** Allows you to easily `await` asynchronous code within your tests, simplifying the process.
*   **Easy to Use:** Simply install the plugin and use the `@pytest.mark.asyncio` decorator to mark your async test functions.
*   **Widely Adopted:**  A popular and reliable solution for testing asynchronous Python code.

## How it Works

pytest-asyncio integrates directly with pytest, providing the necessary hooks to execute asynchronous tests seamlessly.  Simply decorate your asynchronous test functions with `@pytest.mark.asyncio`.

```python
import pytest

@pytest.mark.asyncio
async def test_my_async_function():
    result = await my_async_function()
    assert result == "expected"
```

## Installation

Installing pytest-asyncio is straightforward using pip:

```bash
pip install pytest-asyncio
```

pytest will automatically detect and use the plugin after installation.

## Documentation

Comprehensive documentation, including detailed usage examples and advanced configuration options, is available [here](https://pytest-asyncio.readthedocs.io/en/latest/).
