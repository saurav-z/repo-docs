# pytest-asyncio: Effortlessly Test Asynchronous Python Code

Tired of struggling to test your asynchronous Python code? pytest-asyncio is a powerful pytest plugin that simplifies the testing of asyncio-based applications.  Check out the original repository for more details: [pytest-asyncio](https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest-asyncio).

## Key Features of pytest-asyncio:

*   **Seamless Asyncio Support:** Enables you to write and run tests for code using the `asyncio` library.
*   **Coroutine Test Functions:** Supports coroutines as test functions, allowing you to `await` code directly within your tests.
*   **Simple Integration:**  Easy to install and use; pytest automatically discovers and utilizes the plugin.

## How pytest-asyncio Works:

With pytest-asyncio, you can easily test asynchronous code like this:

```python
import pytest

@pytest.mark.asyncio
async def test_some_asyncio_code():
    res = await library.do_something()
    assert b"expected result" == res
```

## Installation

Install pytest-asyncio using pip:

```bash
pip install pytest-asyncio
```

pytest will automatically discover and use the plugin after installation.

## Contributing

Contributions are welcome! Run tests with `tox` and ensure test coverage remains the same before submitting a pull request.
