# pytest-asyncio: Effortlessly Test Asynchronous Python Code

**pytest-asyncio** is a powerful plugin for pytest that simplifies testing of asynchronous Python code, making it easier than ever to ensure your async applications function correctly.  For more information, visit the [original repository on GitHub](https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest-asyncio).

## Key Features

*   **Seamless Integration:**  Integrates directly with pytest, leveraging its familiar testing structure.
*   **Async Test Function Support:** Allows you to define and execute coroutines directly as test functions.
*   **Await Inside Tests:** Enables the use of `await` within your tests, simplifying the testing of asynchronous code.
*   **Easy Installation:** Install with a simple `pip install pytest-asyncio` command.

## How it Works

pytest-asyncio provides the `@pytest.mark.asyncio` marker to designate async test functions.  This enables you to write tests that interact with asynchronous code using `await`.

```python
import pytest

@pytest.mark.asyncio
async def test_some_asyncio_code():
    res = await library.do_something()  # Assuming library is an async function
    assert b"expected result" == res
```

## Installation

Install pytest-asyncio using pip:

```bash
pip install pytest-asyncio
```

pytest will automatically discover and use the plugin after installation.
