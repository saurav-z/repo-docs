# pytest-asyncio: Seamlessly Test Asynchronous Python Code with pytest

**Easily test your asynchronous Python code using `pytest-asyncio`, a powerful pytest plugin designed to simplify testing with `asyncio`.**  For the latest information and updates, visit the [original repository](https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest-asyncio).

## Key Features of pytest-asyncio:

*   **Asyncio Test Function Support:** Directly use coroutines (async functions) as test functions.
*   **`await` in Tests:**  Effortlessly await the results of asynchronous code within your tests.
*   **pytest Integration:**  Seamlessly integrates with the popular pytest testing framework.
*   **Simple Installation:**  Install with a single pip command.

## Example Usage:

```python
import pytest

@pytest.mark.asyncio
async def test_async_function():
    # Your asynchronous code here
    result = await some_async_function()
    assert result == expected_value
```

## Installation

Install pytest-asyncio using pip:

```bash
pip install pytest-asyncio
```
