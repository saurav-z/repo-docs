# pytest-asyncio: Seamlessly Test Asynchronous Python Code with pytest

**Effortlessly test your asynchronous Python code with pytest-asyncio, a powerful pytest plugin designed for asyncio applications.**

[See the original repository on GitHub](https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest-asyncio)

## Key Features of pytest-asyncio

*   **Asyncio Coroutine Support:** Enables direct use of coroutines as test functions, allowing you to await asynchronous code within your tests.
*   **Easy Integration:** Seamlessly integrates with the pytest testing framework.
*   **Simple Installation:**  Install with a single pip command.
*   **Comprehensive Testing:**  Facilitates thorough testing of applications built with the asyncio library.

## How pytest-asyncio Works

pytest-asyncio simplifies the testing of asyncio-based code.  You can directly use the `@pytest.mark.asyncio` marker to designate an `async` function as a test.  Inside the test function, you can then `await` the results of your asynchronous operations.

```python
import pytest
import library  # Replace with your async module

@pytest.mark.asyncio
async def test_some_asyncio_code():
    res = await library.do_something()
    assert b"expected result" == res
```

## Installation

Install pytest-asyncio using pip:

```bash
pip install pytest-asyncio
```

pytest will automatically discover and use the plugin after installation.

## Contributing

Contributions are highly encouraged!  Run tests using `tox`.  Ensure your changes do not decrease coverage before submitting a pull request.
