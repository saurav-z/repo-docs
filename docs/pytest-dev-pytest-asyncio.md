# pytest-asyncio: Effortlessly Test Asynchronous Python Code

**pytest-asyncio** is a powerful pytest plugin that simplifies testing asynchronous Python code, enabling you to write cleaner, more efficient tests.  Learn more on the [official GitHub repository](https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest-asyncio).

## Key Features

*   **Seamless Asyncio Integration:** Allows you to directly use `asyncio` features within your pytest tests.
*   **Coroutines as Test Functions:**  Write tests using async/await syntax for asynchronous operations.
*   **Easy to Install and Use:** Simply install the plugin and start writing asynchronous tests immediately.

## How pytest-asyncio Works

pytest-asyncio enables you to write tests that utilize `asyncio` in a straightforward manner.  By using the `@pytest.mark.asyncio` decorator, you can define test functions that are coroutines, allowing you to `await` asynchronous operations within your tests.

**Example:**

```python
import pytest

@pytest.mark.asyncio
async def test_some_asyncio_code():
    res = await library.do_something()
    assert b"expected result" == res
```

## Installation

To install pytest-asyncio, use pip:

```bash
pip install pytest-asyncio
```

pytest will automatically detect and use the plugin after installation.

## Contributing

Contributions are greatly appreciated! Run tests with `tox` and ensure coverage remains the same before submitting a pull request.
