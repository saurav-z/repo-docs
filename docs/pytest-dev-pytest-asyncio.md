# pytest-asyncio: Effortlessly Test Your Async Python Code

**pytest-asyncio** is the essential pytest plugin that empowers you to seamlessly test asynchronous Python code using the `asyncio` library.

[Check out the original repo for more details](https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest-asyncio)

## Key Features of pytest-asyncio:

*   **Async Test Functions:** Write and execute tests using coroutines directly.
*   **Await Support:** Easily `await` asynchronous code within your tests for clean and readable assertions.
*   **pytest Integration:** Integrates flawlessly with the popular pytest testing framework.
*   **Simplified Testing:** Streamlines the process of testing asynchronous applications.

## Getting Started

### Installation

Install pytest-asyncio with pip:

```bash
pip install pytest-asyncio
```

pytest will automatically discover and use the plugin after installation.

### Example Usage

```python
import pytest
import asyncio

@pytest.mark.asyncio
async def test_my_async_function():
    result = await my_async_function()
    assert result == "expected_result"
```
