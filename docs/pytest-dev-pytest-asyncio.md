# pytest-asyncio: Seamlessly Test Asynchronous Python Code

**pytest-asyncio** is a powerful pytest plugin that makes it effortless to write and run tests for asynchronous Python code using the `asyncio` library. For more details, visit the original repository on [GitHub](https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest-asyncio).

## Key Features

*   **Async Function Support:** Write tests using coroutines and `await` them directly within your test functions.
*   **pytest Integration:** Seamlessly integrates with the popular pytest testing framework.
*   **Simple Installation:** Easy to install using pip.
*   **Comprehensive Documentation:** Detailed documentation is available to guide you through the plugin's usage.
*   **Open Source:** Released under the Apache License 2.0, encouraging contribution and collaboration.

## How it Works

pytest-asyncio enables you to write tests for code that utilizes Python's `asyncio` library. Simply mark your test functions with `@pytest.mark.asyncio` and use `await` to execute asynchronous code within your tests:

```python
import pytest

@pytest.mark.asyncio
async def test_async_function():
    result = await some_async_function()
    assert result == "expected"
```

## Installation

Install pytest-asyncio using pip:

```bash
pip install pytest-asyncio
```

pytest will automatically discover and use the plugin after installation.

## Contributing

Contributions are highly encouraged. Ensure your pull requests maintain or increase test coverage. Run tests using `tox`.
