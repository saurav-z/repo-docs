# pytest-asyncio: Effortlessly Test Asynchronous Python Code

**pytest-asyncio** is a powerful pytest plugin that simplifies testing asynchronous code, making it easier than ever to ensure your asyncio-based applications function correctly. Check out the original repository on GitHub: [pytest-dev/pytest-asyncio](https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest-asyncio).

## Key Features

*   **Asyncio Coroutine Support:** Enables the use of coroutines as test functions.
*   **`await` Keyword Compatibility:**  Allows the use of `await` within your tests, making it easy to interact with asynchronous code.
*   **Seamless Integration with pytest:** Works as a standard pytest plugin, integrating smoothly into your existing testing workflow.
*   **Simple Installation:** Install with a single pip command.

## Getting Started

### Installation

Install pytest-asyncio using pip:

```bash
pip install pytest-asyncio
```

pytest will automatically discover and load the plugin.

### Example

Here's a simple example of how to use pytest-asyncio:

```python
import pytest

@pytest.mark.asyncio
async def test_some_asyncio_code():
    # Assuming 'library.do_something()' is an async function
    res = await library.do_something()
    assert b"expected result" == res
```
