## Core Concepts

### Scalability, Performance, and Trade-offs

*   **Performance vs. Scalability:** Understand the difference and how to handle both.
*   **Latency vs. Throughput:** Learn how to balance these critical metrics.
*   **CAP Theorem:** Explore the trade-offs between consistency, availability, and partition tolerance.
*   **Consistency Patterns:** Study weak, eventual, and strong consistency models.
*   **Availability Patterns:** Learn about failover and replication strategies.
*   **System Design Topics:** Dive into DNS, CDNs, Load Balancers, and many other topics.

### Database Design

*   **RDBMS:** Learn about relational databases, ACID properties, and common scaling techniques (master-slave, federation, sharding, etc.).
*   **NoSQL Databases:** Explore key-value stores, document stores, wide-column stores, and graph databases.
*   **SQL vs. NoSQL:** Understand the strengths and weaknesses of each approach.

### Caching, Asynchronism, and Communication

*   **Caching Strategies:** Master client, CDN, web server, database, and application caching.
*   **Asynchronism:** Explore message queues, task queues, and back pressure.
*   **Communication Protocols:** Understand TCP, UDP, RPC, and REST.

### Security, Study Guide, and Resources

*   **Security Basics:** Review essential security principles.
*   **Study Guide:** Tailor your preparation based on your interview timeline (short, medium, long).
