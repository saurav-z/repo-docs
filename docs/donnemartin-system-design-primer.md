## Study Guide
Follow this recommended approach to prepare based on your interview timeline:

*   **Short Timeline:** Focus on breadth, and solve a few interview questions.
*   **Medium Timeline:**  Aim for breadth and some depth, solve many interview questions.
*   **Long Timeline:**  Prioritize breadth and greater depth; solve most interview questions.

## Interview Preparation
Learn the step-by-step process to approach a system design interview question:

1.  **Outline Use Cases, Constraints, and Assumptions:**  Gather requirements and scope the problem.
2.  **Create a High-Level Design:** Sketch the main components and connections.
3.  **Design Core Components:** Dive into the details of each core component.
4.  **Scale the Design:** Identify and address bottlenecks.
