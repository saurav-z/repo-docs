## Core Concepts

### Scalability & Performance

*   **Performance vs. Scalability:** Understand the difference between optimizing for individual user experience versus handling increased load.
*   **Latency vs. Throughput:** Grasp the trade-offs between response time and the volume of operations.
*   **Availability vs. Consistency (CAP Theorem):** Learn about the critical trade-off between consistency, availability, and partition tolerance in distributed systems.

### Data Management

*   **Consistency Patterns:** Explore different consistency models, including weak, eventual, and strong consistency.
*   **Database Technologies:**
    *   Relational Databases (RDBMS): master-slave, master-master, federation, sharding, denormalization, SQL tuning.
    *   NoSQL Databases: key-value stores, document stores, wide-column stores, and graph databases, along with when to choose each.
*   **Caching Strategies:** Learn techniques for caching at various levels (client, CDN, web server, application) and when to use cache-aside, write-through, write-behind, and refresh-ahead.

### Architecture Components

*   **DNS, CDNs, and Load Balancers:** Deep dive into how these components enhance performance and availability.
*   **Reverse Proxies:** Understand how reverse proxies provide unified interfaces, increase security, and improve performance.
*   **Application Layer:** Examine microservices and service discovery to build scalable architectures.
*   **Asynchronism:** Utilize message queues and task queues to enhance user experience and decouple components.
*   **Communication:** Discover the basics of TCP, UDP, RPC, and REST and when to use them.

### Security

*   **Security Fundamentals:** Learn about encryption, input sanitization, and the principle of least privilege.

## Study Guide and Interview Preparation

*   **Tailored Preparation:** Review a study guide that recommends topics based on your interview timeline (short, medium, or long).
*   **Interview Approach:** Follow a structured approach to system design interview questions.
*   **Sample Questions & Solutions:** Study common system design and object-oriented design interview questions with sample discussions, code, and diagrams.
