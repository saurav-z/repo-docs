## How to Approach a System Design Interview

Follow these steps to lead the discussion:

1.  **Use Cases, Constraints, and Assumptions:** Define requirements, scope the problem, and clarify use cases and constraints.
2.  **High-Level Design:** Sketch the main components and connections.
3.  **Design Core Components:** Dive into details for each core component.
4.  **Scale the Design:** Address bottlenecks and discuss trade-offs, considering load balancing, caching, and database sharding.
5.  **Back-of-the-Envelope Calculations:** Refer to the [Appendix](#appendix) for handy resources like the Powers of Two table and latency numbers.
