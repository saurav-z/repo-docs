*   **Open Source & Community Driven:** Benefit from a continuously updated open-source project with contributions from the community.  Help by submitting pull requests!
*   **Interview Prep:**  Practice common system design interview questions, compare your results with sample solutions (discussions, code, and diagrams).
*   **Anki Flashcards:** Use the provided [Anki flashcard decks](https://apps.ankiweb.net/) and [Interactive Coding Challenges](https://github.com/donnemartin/interactive-coding-challenges) for on-the-go learning.
*   **Structured Learning:** The guide is designed to help you understand all the core concepts to help you design a scalable system.

## Core Topics Covered

This primer covers the critical aspects of system design:

*   **System Design Fundamentals:** Get started with crucial concepts like performance vs. scalability, latency vs. throughput, and availability vs. consistency (CAP theorem).
*   **Essential Design Patterns:** Explore consistency and availability patterns (fail-over, replication).
*   **Core System Components:** Learn about DNS, CDNs, load balancers, reverse proxies, and the application layer (microservices, service discovery).
*   **Database Deep Dive:** Understand relational databases, NoSQL databases, caching strategies, and database tuning.
*   **Asynchronism and Communication:** Dive into message queues, task queues, and essential communication protocols (TCP, UDP, RPC, REST).
*   **Security:** Get a basic understanding of security considerations.
*   **Comprehensive Study Guide:** Plan your interview preparation based on your timeframe (short, medium, or long).
*   **Interview Guide:** A guide on how to approach system design questions.
*   **Detailed Interview Questions and Solutions:** Includes system design interview questions with solutions and object-oriented design questions with solutions.
