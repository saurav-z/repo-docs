This comprehensive guide provides a structured approach to understanding and designing large-scale systems. Whether you're preparing for a system design interview or looking to improve your engineering skills, this primer will equip you with the knowledge and tools you need to succeed.

## Key Features:

*   **Organized Resources:** An curated collection of system design resources, eliminating the need to scour the web.
*   **Interview Preparation:** Includes sample interview questions, discussions, code, and diagrams to help you prepare for the system design interview.
*   **Real-World Examples:** Analyze architectures from leading tech companies to understand industry best practices.
*   **Community-Driven:**  A collaborative project with opportunities for contributions, translations, and improvements.
*   **Anki Flashcards:**  Spaced repetition decks to reinforce key concepts and help you learn on the go.

## Core Topics Covered:

### 1. System Design Fundamentals

*   Performance vs. Scalability
*   Latency vs. Throughput
*   Availability vs. Consistency (CAP Theorem)
*   Consistency Patterns (Weak, Eventual, Strong)
*   Availability Patterns (Failover, Replication)

### 2. Essential System Components

*   Domain Name System (DNS)
*   Content Delivery Network (CDN)
*   Load Balancers
*   Reverse Proxy (Web Servers)
*   Application Layer (Microservices, Service Discovery)

### 3. Data Storage & Management

*   Databases (RDBMS, NoSQL)
    *   Replication Strategies (Master-Slave, Master-Master)
    *   Federation, Sharding, Denormalization
    *   SQL Tuning
    *   NoSQL (Key-Value, Document, Wide Column, Graph)
    *   SQL vs. NoSQL Trade-offs
*   Caching Strategies (Client, CDN, Web Server, Application)
    *   Cache-Aside, Write-Through, Write-Behind, Refresh-Ahead

### 4. System Communication

*   Asynchronism (Message Queues, Task Queues, Back Pressure)
*   Communication Protocols (TCP, UDP, RPC, REST)

### 5. Essential Considerations

*   Security (Encryption, Input Sanitization, Least Privilege)

## Study Guide: Tailor Your Learning
