# System Design Primer: Your Guide to Designing Large-Scale Systems

**Tired of feeling lost in system design interviews?**  This open-source resource provides an organized collection of resources, sample solutions, and study guides to help you understand and tackle system design challenges. [Explore the original repo](https://github.com/donnemartin/system-design-primer) for a deeper dive!

## Key Features:

*   **Comprehensive Topics:**  From basic principles to in-depth explorations of key system design areas such as:
    *   Scalability and Performance
    *   Load Balancing, CDNs, and Reverse Proxies
    *   Databases (SQL, NoSQL), Caching, and Asynchronism
    *   Communication Protocols (HTTP, TCP, UDP, RPC, REST)
    *   Security considerations
*   **Interview Preparation:**  Includes a dedicated study guide, a step-by-step approach to system design interviews, and numerous example questions **with solutions**.
*   **Open Source & Community Driven:**  Benefit from a continually updated project with contributions from the open source community.  [Contribute](#contributing) to improve the guide!
*   **Anki Flashcards:**  Utilize provided Anki decks to reinforce your understanding of system design concepts.
*   **Real-World Architectures:**  Analyze architecture diagrams and articles from leading tech companies like Netflix, Twitter, and Uber to gain insights into how real-world systems are designed.

## Core Concepts Covered:

*   **Performance vs. Scalability:** Understanding the difference and trade-offs.
*   **Latency vs. Throughput:** Balancing speed and capacity.
*   **CAP Theorem:**  Explore Consistency, Availability, and Partition Tolerance in distributed systems.
*   **Consistency and Availability Patterns:**  Learn about weak, eventual, and strong consistency, along with fail-over and replication.
*   **System Design Topics:** A wide range of core topics, including:
    *   Domain Name System (DNS)
    *   Content Delivery Networks (CDNs)
    *   Load Balancers
    *   Reverse Proxies
    *   Application Layer (Microservices, Service Discovery)
    *   Databases (Relational, NoSQL) and Caching
    *   Asynchronism and Communication Protocols
