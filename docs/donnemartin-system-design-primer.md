## Key Features

*   **Organized Learning:** A structured collection of resources to help you build systems at scale.
*   **Interview Prep:** Prepare for system design interviews with common questions, solutions, and design discussions.
*   **Community-Driven:** Benefit from a continually updated, open-source project with contributions welcome.
*   **Comprehensive Topics:** Dive into performance vs. scalability, latency vs. throughput, CAP theorem, caching strategies, and more.
*   **Anki Flashcards:** Utilize the provided Anki flashcard decks to help retain key system design concepts.

## Core Concepts

*   **Scalability:** Learn how to design scalable systems and understand the principles behind building systems at scale.
*   **Interview Preparation:** Practice common system design interview questions, and compare your results with sample solutions (discussions, code, and diagrams).
*   **Open Source & Community:** Contribute to this growing resource, and learn from the open source community.

## Key Topics

*   **System Design Fundamentals:** Performance vs. Scalability, Latency vs. Throughput, CAP Theorem.
*   **Consistency & Availability:** Understanding Consistency Patterns, Availability Patterns and Fail-over/Replication strategies.
*   **Core Infrastructure:** Deep dives into DNS, CDNs, Load Balancers, Reverse Proxies, Application Layer, and Microservices.
*   **Data Management:** Explore various database technologies, including RDBMS, NoSQL databases (key-value, document, wide column, and graph databases), and caching strategies.
*   **Asynchronous Architectures:** Learn about message queues, task queues, and back pressure for building robust systems.
*   **Communication Protocols:** Understand essential protocols such as TCP, UDP, RPC, and REST.

## Study Guide

*   Suggested topics to review based on your interview timeline (short, medium, long).
*   Answers the question: "Do I need to know everything here?"
    *   **Short timeline:** Aim for breadth with system design topics. Practice by solving some interview questions.
    *   **Medium timeline:** Aim for breadth and some depth with system design topics. Practice by solving many interview questions.
    *   **Long timeline:** Aim for breadth and more depth with system design topics. Practice by solving most interview questions.

## How to Approach a System Design Interview

1.  **Requirements Gathering:** Outline use cases, constraints, and assumptions.
2.  **High-Level Design:** Create a high-level design with all important components.
3.  **Component Design:** Dive into details for each core component.
4.  **Scaling:** Identify and address bottlenecks; discuss potential solutions and trade-offs.
5.  **Back-of-the-Envelope Calculations:** Use relevant formulas to do estimation by hand.
