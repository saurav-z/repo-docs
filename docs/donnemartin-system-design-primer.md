## Study Guide

The guide is based on your interview timeline to help you prioritize:

*   **Short Timeline:** Focus on breadth with system design topics and solve some interview questions.
*   **Medium Timeline:** Aim for breadth and depth, and solve many interview questions.
*   **Long Timeline:** Focus on breadth and depth, and practice solving most interview questions.

## How to Approach a System Design Interview Question

1.  **Outline Use Cases, Constraints, and Assumptions:** Clarify requirements and scope the problem.
2.  **Create a High-Level Design:** Sketch the main components and connections.
3.  **Design Core Components:** Dive into details for each core component.
4.  **Scale the Design:** Identify and address bottlenecks, given the constraints.
5.  **Back-of-the-Envelope Calculations:** Use the provided table and numbers to estimate.
