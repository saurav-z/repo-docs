# System Design Primer: Your Guide to Designing Scalable Systems

Tired of confusing system design concepts? This comprehensive guide provides an organized collection of resources to help you master system design principles, prepare for technical interviews, and build robust, scalable systems. **[Explore the original repository on GitHub](https://github.com/donnemartin/system-design-primer) for a deeper dive.**

## Key Features:

*   **Comprehensive Resource Collection:** Access a curated list of articles, videos, and architectural diagrams covering a wide range of system design topics.
*   **Interview Preparation:** Ace system design interviews with practice questions, sample solutions, and helpful guidance on how to approach these complex questions.
*   **Community-Driven:** Contribute to a continually updated, open-source project by suggesting improvements, fixing errors, and adding new content.
*   **Anki Flashcards:** Enhance knowledge retention with the provided Anki flashcard decks for system design, exercises, and object-oriented design (check out the [interactive-coding-challenges](https://github.com/donnemartin/interactive-coding-challenges) for coding interview prep).
