##  How to Approach System Design Interview Questions

A system design interview is an open-ended conversation, and here's how to approach it:

1.  **Clarify Requirements:** Outline use cases, constraints, and assumptions.
2.  **Create a High-Level Design:** Sketch out the main components and their connections.
3.  **Design Core Components:** Dive into the details of each critical component.
4.  **Scale the Design:**  Address potential bottlenecks and suggest solutions.
5.  **Back-of-the-Envelope Calculations:** Estimate resource needs using practical methods.
