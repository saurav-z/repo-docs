## System Design Interview Preparation & Knowledge

This guide is designed to prepare you for system design interviews and equip you with the knowledge to build scalable systems.  Whether you're a seasoned engineer or just starting out, this primer has you covered.

### What is System Design?

System design is a broad discipline with a vast amount of information distributed across the web.  This repository serves as an organized collection of resources to guide your learning.

### Why is System Design Important?

*   **Become a Better Engineer**:  Learning to design scalable systems is critical for creating effective software.
*   **Interview Success**: System design interviews are a required component of technical interviews at many tech companies.

### Main Topics Covered

*   **Fundamentals**: Performance vs. Scalability, Latency vs. Throughput, Availability vs. Consistency (CAP Theorem).
*   **Consistency Patterns**: Weak, Eventual, and Strong consistency.
*   **Availability Patterns**: Fail-over and Replication.
*   **Network Basics**: DNS, CDNs, and Load Balancers.
*   **Application Layer**: Microservices and Service Discovery.
*   **Databases**: SQL and NoSQL approaches, Relational Databases (RDBMS), and NoSQL Databases, and their respective scaling methods (e.g., master-slave replication, sharding).
*   **Caching**: Client, CDN, Web Server, Database, and Application caching.
*   **Asynchronism**: Message queues, task queues, and back pressure.
*   **Communication**: TCP, UDP, RPC, and REST.
*   **Security**:  Basic security principles.
*   **Appendix**: Valuable reference material including a Powers of Two table, Latency Numbers, Additional Interview Questions, Real-World and Company Architectures, and Engineering Blogs.
