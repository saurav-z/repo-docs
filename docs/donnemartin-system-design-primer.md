## Study Guide

Follow this guide to prepare for system design interviews based on your timeline:

*   **Short Timeline:** Focus on breadth with the core system design topics. Practice solving a few interview questions.
*   **Medium Timeline:** Aim for both breadth and some depth. Practice solving many interview questions.
*   **Long Timeline:** Study with breadth and greater depth. Practice solving most interview questions.

## How to Approach a System Design Interview Question

This section details the steps to effectively address a system design interview question, including:

*   **Step 1:** Outline use cases, constraints, and assumptions
*   **Step 2:** Create a high-level design
*   **Step 3:** Design core components
*   **Step 4:** Scale the design
*   Back-of-the-envelope calculations
*   Source(s) and further reading
