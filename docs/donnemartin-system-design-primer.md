## Study Guide

Structured guidance for your interview preparation based on your timeline (Short, Medium, Long).

## Approach to System Design Interviews

Follow a structured process to tackle system design questions:

1.  **Requirements & Scope:** Outline use cases, constraints, and assumptions.
2.  **High-Level Design:** Sketch the main components and connections.
3.  **Component Design:** Dive into the details of core components.
4.  **Scalability:** Identify and address bottlenecks.
