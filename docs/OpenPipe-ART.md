## RULER: Revolutionize Agent Reward Scoring

**RULER (Relative Universal LLM-Elicited Rewards)** simplifies agent training by using an LLM as a judge to automatically score agent trajectories, removing the need for manual reward functions, labeled data, or expert feedback.

```python
# Before: Hours of reward engineering
def complex_reward_function(trajectory):
    # 50+ lines of careful scoring logic...
    pass

# After: One line with RULER
judged_group = await ruler_score_group(group, "openai/o3")
```

## ART: Train Multi-Step Agents with GRPO

ART is an open-source RL framework designed to enhance agent reliability by enabling LLMs to **learn from experience** using GRPO. ART provides a streamlined framework for integrating GRPO into any Python application.

## üîÅ Training Loop Explained

ART's functionality is split into a **client** and a **server** to manage the RL process:

1.  **Inference:**
    *   Your code uses the ART client to perform agentic workflows (e.g., parallel rollouts).
    *   Completion requests are routed to the ART server.
    *   Each message is stored as a Trajectory.
    *   A `reward` is assigned to each Trajectory upon completion.
2.  **Training:**
    *   Trajectories are grouped and sent to the server.
    *   The server trains your model using GRPO.
    *   The server saves and loads the newly trained LoRA.
    *   Inference resumes.

The loop continues until the desired training iterations are complete.

## üß© Supported Models

ART is compatible with most vLLM/HuggingFace-transformers causal language models (e.g., those supported by [Unsloth](https://docs.unsloth.ai/get-started/all-our-models)). If a model is not working, please reach out on [Discord](https://discord.gg/zbBHRUpwf4) or open an issue on [GitHub](https://github.com/openpipe/art/issues).
