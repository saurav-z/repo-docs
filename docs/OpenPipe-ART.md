## Train and Enhance LLM Agents with ART

ART is an open-source framework that empowers you to train and refine large language model (LLM) agents to perform complex, real-world tasks with the power of reinforcement learning.  Leverage the capabilities of GRPO, and eliminate the need for complex reward functions with **RULER**, our LLM-as-judge solution. Explore ART on [GitHub](https://github.com/OpenPipe/ART).

**Key Features:**

*   **RULER: Zero-Shot Agent Rewards:** Automate reward scoring using LLMs, eliminating manual reward function engineering.
    *   2-3x faster development compared to hand-crafted reward functions.
    *   Works across any task without modification.
    *   Matches or exceeds hand-crafted rewards in 3/4 benchmarks.
    *   Easy integration with a drop-in replacement for manual reward functions.
*   **Ergonomic GRPO Integration:** ART provides an accessible interface for incorporating reinforcement learning into your applications.
*   **Flexible Training:** Train agents from any location and platform. ART seamlessly integrates with hosted platforms like W&B, Langfuse, and OpenPipe, or you can run it locally.
*   **Intelligent Defaults:** Configure training parameters to meet your specific needs, or leverage optimized default settings.
*   **Modular Architecture:** ART's client-server setup simplifies integrating RL into your existing codebase.

## ART‚Ä¢E Agent: Real-World Application

See how ART was used to train an email agent! Check out the [ART‚Ä¢E Agent](https://openpipe.ai/blog/art-e-mail-agent) blog post to learn how we trained Qwen 2.5 14B to outperform o3 at email retrieval.

## Training Loop Overview

ART employs a client-server architecture:

1.  **Inference:**
    *   Your code uses the ART client to perform an agentic workflow.
    *   Requests are routed to the ART server, running the model's latest LoRA in vLLM.
    *   Each message is stored in a Trajectory.
    *   Rollouts are assigned a reward.
2.  **Training:**
    *   Trajectories are grouped and sent to the server.
    *   The server trains your model using GRPO.
    *   The server saves the LoRA and loads it into vLLM.
    *   The loop resumes with inference.

## Supported Models

ART supports most vLLM/HuggingFace-transformers compatible causal language models, including those supported by [Unsloth](https://docs.unsloth.ai/get-started/all-our-models).
