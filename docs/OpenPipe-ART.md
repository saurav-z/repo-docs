## Introduction to Agent Reinforcement Trainer (ART)

**ART is an open-source framework designed to enhance the reliability of your AI agents by enabling them to learn and improve through experience using GRPO.** Built for Python applications, ART provides an easy-to-use harness for integrating reinforcement learning, enabling you to train LLM-based agents for complex, real-world tasks.  Visit the [official ART repository on GitHub](https://github.com/OpenPipe/ART) to get started.

## Key Features of ART

*   **No Labeled Data Required:** ART learns by analyzing the tools and environment of a model, eliminating the need for pre-labeled training data.
*   **General-Purpose Applicability:** ART can optimize models for use with any Model Context Protocol (MCP) server, enhancing flexibility.
*   **Superior Performance:** Achieves or exceeds state-of-the-art (SOTA) results in two out of three benchmarks.
*   **Simplified Integration:** Requires no custom modifications to your existing MCP server setup.
*   **Modular Design:** Separates client and server functionalities for flexible deployment.
*   **Flexible Training:** Supports training from any client machine or on a local GPU.
*   **Easy Debugging:** Integrations with platforms such as W&B, Langfuse, and OpenPipe.
*   **Customization with Defaults:** Configure training parameters and inference engine configurations to meet your needs or use our optimized defaults.

## How to Get Started: MCP‚Ä¢RL Example

Train your agents using the cutting-edge **MCP‚Ä¢RL** method.  Here's a quick example to get you started:

```python
from art.rewards import ruler_score_group

# Specialize a model for NWS MCP server
MCP_SERVER_URL = "https://server.smithery.ai/@smithery-ai/national-weather-service/mcp"

# Generate training scenarios based on MCP tools
scenarios = await generate_scenarios(
    num_scenarios=24,
    server_url=MCP_SERVER_URL,
)

# ...run the agent...

# Use RULER to assign relative scores to each trajectory
scored_groups = []
for group in groups:
    judged_group = await ruler_score_group(group)
    scored_groups.append(judged_group)

# Train the model to improve performance on the MCP server
await model.train(scored_groups)
```

## Why Choose ART?

ART offers a streamlined solution for integrating RL into your existing applications. It abstracts the training server into a modular service, removing the need for direct code interaction.

## Installation

Easily integrate ART into your Python projects with a simple `pip` command:

```bash
pip install openpipe-art
```

## ü§ñ ART‚Ä¢E Agent: A Real-World Example

Discover how ART can be applied to practical tasks, like the [ART‚Ä¢E Agent](https://openpipe.ai/blog/art-e-mail-agent), which demonstrates the training of a Qwen 2.5 14B model to outperform o3 in email retrieval.

## ART Training Loop Explained

ART's functionality is divided into a **client** and a **server**, which works as follows:

1.  **Inference:**
    *   Your code uses the ART client to perform an agentic workflow.
    *   Completion requests route to the ART server.
    *   Each `system`, `user`, and `assistant` message is stored in a Trajectory.
    *   Your code assigns a reward to its Trajectory when a rollout finishes.
2.  **Training:**
    *   Trajectories are grouped and sent to the server.
    *   The server trains your model using GRPO, initializing from the latest checkpoint.
    *   The server saves the new LoRA and loads it into vLLM.
    *   Inference is unblocked and the loop resumes.

This training loop runs until the set iterations are complete.

## üß© Supported Models

ART is designed to work with most vLLM/HuggingFace-transformers compatible causal language models, including those supported by [Unsloth](https://docs.unsloth.ai/get-started/all-our-models).
