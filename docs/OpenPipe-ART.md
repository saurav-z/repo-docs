## Unlock the Power of AI Agents with ART

**Agent Reinforcement Trainer (ART)** is an open-source framework designed to empower you to train multi-step agents using the GRPO reinforcement learning method, enabling LLMs to learn from experience and excel at real-world tasks. Visit the [original repository](https://github.com/OpenPipe/ART) for the source code.

**Key Features of ART:**

*   **Zero-Shot Rewards with RULER:** Leverage Relative Universal LLM-Elicited Rewards (RULER) to automatically score agent trajectories, eliminating the need for manual reward functions.
*   **Faster Development:** Significantly accelerate your development process by skipping the time-consuming task of reward function engineering.
*   **Versatile Application:** Adaptable to any task without modification, providing a flexible solution for various agent-based projects.
*   **Superior Performance:** Achieve performance that matches or exceeds hand-crafted rewards in many benchmarks.
*   **Simplified Integration:** Easily integrate ART into your existing projects, acting as a drop-in replacement for manual reward functions.
*   **Modular Architecture:**  ART is divided into a client and server, allowing for flexible deployment and use.
*   **Training Flexibility:**  Train from anywhere, using either your local GPU or the ART server to kick off a GPU-enabled environment.

```python
# Before: Hours of reward engineering
def complex_reward_function(trajectory):
    # 50+ lines of careful scoring logic...
    pass

# After: One line with RULER
judged_group = await ruler_score_group(group, "openai/o3")
```

## üîÅ Training Loop Explained

ART functions with a clear client-server architecture:

1.  **Inference Phase:**

    *   Your code uses the ART client for agentic workflows.
    *   Completions are handled by the ART server, using the latest model weights in vLLM.
    *   Agent interactions are recorded as Trajectories.
    *   Upon completion, a reward is assigned to each Trajectory.
2.  **Training Phase:**

    *   Trajectories are grouped and sent to the server for training.
    *   The server trains your model with GRPO, starting from the latest checkpoint.
    *   Trained weights are saved and loaded into vLLM.
    *   Inference resumes, and the cycle repeats.

This loop runs until a predefined number of iterations are completed.

## üß© Supported Models

ART supports most vLLM/HuggingFace-transformers compatible causal language models, including those supported by [Unsloth](https://docs.unsloth.ai/get-started/all-our-models), with the exception of Gemma 3.
