## Agent Reinforcement Trainer (ART): Supercharge Your LLM Agents with RL!

ART is an open-source reinforcement learning (RL) framework designed to effortlessly train powerful, multi-step LLM agents, providing an ergonomic way to integrate GRPO into your Python applications.  [Learn More on GitHub](https://github.com/OpenPipe/ART).

**Key Features & Benefits:**

*   **Effortless Agent Training:** Train multi-step agents for complex tasks with a simplified RL pipeline.
*   **RULER: Zero-Shot Reward Engineering:** Leverage LLMs to automatically score agent trajectories, eliminating the need for manual reward functions.
*   **Faster Development:** Reduce development time by 2-3x by skipping reward function engineering.
*   **General-Purpose Applicability:**  ART works across diverse tasks without modification.
*   **Strong Performance:**  Achieves or surpasses hand-crafted rewards in multiple benchmarks.
*   **Easy Integration:**  Seamlessly integrate ART into existing applications with a drop-in replacement for manual reward functions.
*   **Flexible Training:** Run the ART client locally or on a GPU-enabled server.
*   **Observability & Debugging:** Integrations with platforms like W&B, Langfuse, and OpenPipe streamline debugging.
*   **Customizable & Optimized:** Configure training parameters and inference engines to meet specific needs, with intelligent defaults for efficiency and stability.

## üìè RULER: Zero-Shot Agent Rewards Explained

**RULER** (Relative Universal LLM-Elicited Rewards) simplifies agent training by using an LLM-as-judge to automatically score agent trajectories. Just define your task in the system prompt, and RULER handles the rest ‚Äì **no labeled data, expert feedback, or reward engineering required.**

```python
# Before: Hours of reward engineering
def complex_reward_function(trajectory):
    # 50+ lines of careful scoring logic...
    pass

# After: One line with RULER
judged_group = await ruler_score_group(group, "openai/o3")
```

## üîÅ ART Training Loop: How it Works

ART uses a client-server architecture for efficient RL training.

1.  **Inference:**
    *   Your code uses the ART client for agentic workflows (e.g. parallel rollouts).
    *   Requests are routed to the ART server, which runs the latest LoRA in vLLM.
    *   Messages are stored in a Trajectory.
    *   A `reward` is assigned to the Trajectory at the end.

2.  **Training:**
    *   Trajectories are grouped and sent to the server.
    *   The server trains your model using GRPO.
    *   The server saves the new LoRA and loads it into vLLM.
    *   The loop resumes at Step 1.

This continues until the specified iterations are complete.

## üß© Supported Models

ART is compatible with most vLLM/HuggingFace-transformers causal language models (e.g., those supported by [Unsloth](https://docs.unsloth.ai/get-started/all-our-models)), though it does not support Gemma 3 at this time.  If you have issues with other models, please let us know!
