## Supercharge Your AI Agents with Agent Reinforcement Trainer (ART)

ART is an open-source framework designed to simplify and accelerate the training of sophisticated, multi-step AI agents.  Using Gradient Guided Policy Optimization (GRPO), ART empowers your agents to learn from experience, leading to improved reliability and performance.  Ready to revolutionize your AI agent training?  [Explore ART on GitHub](https://github.com/OpenPipe/ART).

## Key Features

*   **Effortless Reward Engineering:**  Leverage **RULER** (Relative Universal LLM-Elicited Rewards) to eliminate the need for hand-crafted reward functions.  Simply define your task, and let RULER handle the scoring using an LLM-as-judge.
*   **Accelerated Development:**  RULER can lead to **2-3x faster development**, saving you time and resources.
*   **General-Purpose Applicability:** ART works across a wide range of tasks without modification, making it a versatile solution for diverse agent training needs.
*   **High Performance:** Achieve results that match or exceed hand-crafted rewards in various benchmarks.
*   **Seamless Integration:**  ART is designed for easy integration into existing applications.
*   **Flexible Training Loop:** ART's modular architecture supports both client and server components for flexible deployment.
*   **Extensive Model Support:** ART supports vLLM/HuggingFace-transformers compatible causal language models.

## üìè RULER: Zero-Shot Agent Rewards

**RULER** (Relative Universal LLM-Elicited Rewards) uses an LLM-as-judge to automatically score agent trajectories, eliminating the need for hand-crafted reward functions. Simply define your task in the system prompt, and RULER handles the rest‚Äî**no labeled data, expert feedback, or reward engineering required**.

‚ú® **Key Benefits:**

-   **2-3x faster development** - Skip reward function engineering entirely
-   **General-purpose** - Works across any task without modification
-   **Strong performance** - Matches or exceeds hand-crafted rewards in 3/4 benchmarks
-   **Easy integration** - Drop-in replacement for manual reward functions

```python
# Before: Hours of reward engineering
def complex_reward_function(trajectory):
    # 50+ lines of careful scoring logic...
    pass

# After: One line with RULER
judged_group = await ruler_score_group(group, "openai/o3")
```

## üîÅ Training Loop: How ART Works

ART employs a client-server architecture:

1.  **Inference:** The ART client handles agentic workflows, sending requests to the ART server, which runs the model's latest LoRA in vLLM. Trajectories are created and stored.
2.  **Training:**  Once a rollout finishes, your code provides a reward to a Trajectory. Trajectories are then sent to the server, which trains the model using GRPO and saves the updated LoRA.

This loop continues until the specified number of iterations is reached.

## üß© Supported Models

ART is designed to work with most vLLM/HuggingFace-transformers compatible causal language models. Check the [Unsloth](https://docs.unsloth.ai/get-started/all-our-models) documentation for a list of supported models.
