## Key Features of ART

*   **Train LLM Agents:** Develop and train multi-step agents for complex tasks using Reinforcement Learning.
*   **RULER: Zero-Shot Reward Engineering:** Utilize RULER (Relative Universal LLM-Elicited Rewards) to automatically score agent behavior, **eliminating the need for hand-crafted reward functions**.
    *   **Faster Development:** Significantly reduce development time by skipping reward engineering.
    *   **General-Purpose:** Works across diverse tasks without modification.
    *   **Strong Performance:** Achieve performance that rivals or exceeds hand-crafted reward systems.
    *   **Easy Integration:** Seamlessly integrate RULER as a drop-in replacement for manual reward functions.
*   **GRPO Integration:** ART leverages GRPO (Generalized Reward Policy Optimization) for efficient agent training.
*   **Open-Source & Customizable:** Benefit from an open-source framework with intelligent defaults and flexible configuration options.
*   **Modular Client/Server Architecture:** The client-server architecture simplifies integration into your existing applications, allowing you to focus on your agents.
*   **Flexible Training Environments:** Train agents locally or leverage GPU-enabled environments.
*   **Observability & Debugging:** Integrate with platforms like W&B, Langfuse, and OpenPipe for enhanced monitoring and debugging.

## Getting Started with ART

### Installation

Install the ART Python package:

```bash
pip install openpipe-art
```

### RULER in Action

Here's how easy it is to use RULER to score your agent trajectories:

```python
# Before: Hours of reward engineering
def complex_reward_function(trajectory):
    # 50+ lines of careful scoring logic...
    pass

# After: One line with RULER
judged_group = await ruler_score_group(group, "openai/o3")
```

## ART Architecture & Training Loop

ART utilizes a client-server architecture:

1.  **Inference:**
    *   Your code uses the ART client to perform agent workflows.
    *   Completion requests are routed to the ART server, running the latest LoRA in vLLM.
    *   Each `system`, `user`, and `assistant` message is stored in a Trajectory.
    *   When a rollout finishes, your code assigns a `reward`.
2.  **Training:**
    *   Trajectories are grouped and sent to the server. Inference is blocked during training.
    *   The server trains your model using GRPO.
    *   The server saves the newly trained LoRA and loads it into vLLM.
    *   Inference is unblocked, and the loop restarts.

This loop continues until the specified number of iterations is reached.

## ü§ñ ART‚Ä¢E Agent

See how to apply ART to real-world tasks by reading about the [ART‚Ä¢E Agent](https://openpipe.ai/blog/art-e-mail-agent) on the OpenPipe blog, where a Qwen 2.5 14B model was trained to excel at email retrieval.
