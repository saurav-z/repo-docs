## Key Features of ART

*   **No Labeled Data Required:** Train agents by analyzing their actions and the environments they interact with.
*   **Versatile:** ART is designed to optimize models for any Model Context Protocol (MCP) server.
*   **High Performance:** Achieve cutting-edge results, matching or surpassing state-of-the-art performance in benchmarks.
*   **Easy Integration:** Requires no modifications to your existing MCP server.
*   **Open Source & Flexible:** Build on a robust, open-source framework with customizable training and inference settings.

## Training Agents with ART

ART leverages a client-server architecture for efficient training. The client handles agent interaction and reward assignments, while the server manages model training using techniques like GRPO.  See the training loop overview below.

### Quickstart Example: Fine-tuning an Agent with MCP‚Ä¢RL

```python
from art.rewards import ruler_score_group

# Specialize a model for NWS MCP server
MCP_SERVER_URL = "https://server.smithery.ai/@smithery-ai/national-weather-service/mcp"

# Generate training scenarios based on MCP tools
scenarios = await generate_scenarios(
    num_scenarios=24,
    server_url=MCP_SERVER_URL,
)

# ...run the agent...

# Use RULER to assign relative scores to each trajectory
scored_groups = []
for group in groups:
    judged_group = await ruler_score_group(group)
    scored_groups.append(judged_group)

# Train the model to improve performance on the MCP server
await model.train(scored_groups)
```

## ART Overview & Training Loop

ART simplifies the process of training RL agents.  It uses a client-server architecture, allowing you to train agents efficiently.

### üîÅ Training Loop Overview

1.  **Inference:**
    *   Your code uses the ART client to perform an agentic workflow.
    *   Completion requests are routed to the ART server, which runs the model's latest LoRA in vLLM.
    *   As the agent executes, each `system`, `user`, and `assistant` message is stored in a Trajectory.
    *   When a rollout finishes, your code assigns a `reward` to its Trajectory, indicating the performance of the LLM.
2.  **Training:**
    *   When each rollout has finished, Trajectories are grouped and sent to the server. Inference is blocked while training executes.
    *   The server trains your model using GRPO, initializing from the latest checkpoint (or an empty LoRA on the first iteration).
    *   The server saves the newly trained LoRA to a local directory and loads it into vLLM.
    *   Inference is unblocked and the loop resumes at step 1.
