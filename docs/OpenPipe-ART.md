## Revolutionize Agent Training with ART: Train LLMs to Perform Complex Tasks

**ART (Agent Reinforcement Trainer)** is an open-source reinforcement learning framework designed to enhance agent reliability by enabling Language Models (LLMs) to learn from experience using GRPO.  ART provides a robust and ergonomic framework for integrating GRPO into any Python application. This allows you to build agents capable of handling intricate, multi-step tasks without the need for extensive manual reward engineering.

**Key Features of ART:**

*   **Zero-Shot Reward with RULER:** Leverage the power of RULER (Relative Universal LLM-Elicited Rewards) to eliminate the need for hand-crafted reward functions. Simply define your task, and RULER automatically scores agent trajectories, saving you time and effort.
*   **Faster Development:** ART significantly accelerates development, potentially 2-3x faster, by eliminating reward function engineering.
*   **General-Purpose & Versatile:** ART is designed to work across a wide range of tasks without requiring modification, making it highly adaptable.
*   **Performance:** ART delivers strong performance, often matching or exceeding hand-crafted rewards in various benchmarks.
*   **Easy Integration:** Seamlessly integrate ART into your existing projects as a drop-in replacement for manual reward functions.
*   **Modular Architecture:** ART is divided into a client and server architecture for flexible deployment.
*   **Train from Anywhere:** Run the ART client on your local machine and train on remote GPUs, or train on a local GPU for maximum control.

## RULER: Simplifying Reward Engineering

**RULER** (Relative Universal LLM-Elicited Rewards) empowers you to train agents without the complexities of manual reward functions.  RULER employs an LLM as a judge, automatically scoring agent trajectories based on your task description.  This streamlined approach simplifies agent training significantly.

*   **No Labeled Data Required:** Eliminate the need for labeled data.
*   **No Expert Feedback Required:** Remove the need for expert feedback.
*   **Simplified Reward Engineering:** Avoid the need for complex reward functions.

```python
# Before: Hours of reward engineering
def complex_reward_function(trajectory):
    # 50+ lines of careful scoring logic...
    pass

# After: One line with RULER
judged_group = await ruler_score_group(group, "openai/o3")
```

## üîÅ ART Training Loop: How It Works

ART's functionality is divided into a **client** and a **server**, enabling efficient reinforcement learning. The client interfaces with your code, while the server handles the training.

1.  **Inference Phase:**
    1.  Your code uses the ART client to run an agentic workflow.
    2.  Completion requests are sent to the ART server, which uses vLLM to run the model's latest LoRA.
    3.  Messages are stored in a Trajectory.
    4.  After a rollout, your code assigns a reward.
2.  **Training Phase:**
    1.  Trajectories are grouped and sent to the server.
    2.  The server trains your model using GRPO.
    3.  The server saves the updated LoRA.
    4.  Inference resumes.

The loop continues until the specified number of iterations is complete.

## üß© Supported Models

ART is designed to be compatible with most vLLM/HuggingFace-transformers compatible causal language models, including those supported by [Unsloth](https://docs.unsloth.ai/get-started/all-our-models).  If you encounter any issues with a specific model, please reach out on [Discord](https://discord.gg/zbBHRUpwf4) or open an issue on [GitHub](https://github.com/openpipe/art/issues).
