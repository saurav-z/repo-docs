## Key Features of ART

*   **Simplified RL for Agents:** Easily integrate reinforcement learning into your existing applications with modular components and intelligent defaults.
*   **Zero-Shot Reward Engineering with RULER:** Leverage the power of LLMs to automatically score agent trajectories, eliminating the need for hand-crafted reward functions. This can speed up development 2-3x!
*   **Train Anywhere:** Run the ART client on your local machine while the ART server leverages GPUs.
*   **Optimized for Performance:** ART is built with GRPO, vLLM, and Unsloth for optimal training and inference efficiency.
*   **Flexible Observability:** Integrate with platforms like W&B, Langfuse, and OpenPipe for improved debugging and monitoring.

## RULER: The Future of Agent Rewards

**RULER (Relative Universal LLM-Elicited Rewards)** revolutionizes reward engineering by using an LLM-as-judge to automatically score agent trajectories. Define your task, and RULER handles the rest ‚Äì no labeled data, expert feedback, or manual reward engineering needed.

**Key Benefits of RULER:**

*   **Faster Development:** Skip reward function engineering entirely.
*   **General-Purpose:** Works across any task without modification.
*   **Strong Performance:** Matches or exceeds hand-crafted rewards in various benchmarks.
*   **Easy Integration:** Drop-in replacement for manual reward functions.

```python
# Before: Hours of reward engineering
def complex_reward_function(trajectory):
    # 50+ lines of careful scoring logic...
    pass

# After: One line with RULER
judged_group = await ruler_score_group(group, "openai/o3")
```

## üîÅ Training Loop Breakdown

ART leverages a client-server architecture:

1.  **Inference:** The ART client performs agentic workflows using the LLM.  Rollouts generate trajectories.
2.  **Reward:** Your code assigns a reward to each Trajectory after the completion of a rollout, indicating its performance.
3.  **Training:** Trajectories are grouped and sent to the server. The server trains your model using GRPO, saving the LoRA, and loading it into vLLM.  The loop then restarts.

This loop continues until a specified number of inference and training iterations are completed.

## üß© Supported Models

ART is designed to work with most vLLM/HuggingFace-transformers compatible causal language models, including those supported by [Unsloth](https://docs.unsloth.ai/get-started/all-our-models). If you encounter any compatibility issues, please reach out on [Discord](https://discord.gg/zbBHRUpwf4) or [GitHub](https://github.com/openpipe/art/issues).
