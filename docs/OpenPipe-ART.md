## Key Features

*   **Effortless Reward Engineering:** Leverage **RULER**, a zero-shot reward system that uses LLMs as judges to automatically score agent trajectories, eliminating the need for hand-crafted reward functions.
*   **Accelerated Development:** Experience 2-3x faster development by skipping the time-consuming process of reward function engineering.
*   **General-Purpose Applicability:** ART's architecture allows it to work across any task without requiring modifications.
*   **High Performance:** Achieve results that match or exceed hand-crafted rewards in many benchmarks.
*   **Seamless Integration:** Easily integrate ART into your existing applications with a drop-in replacement for manual reward functions.
*   **Modular Architecture**: ART divides functionality into a client and server for flexible training from anywhere.
*   **Extensible Observability**: Easily integrate platforms like W&B, Langfuse, and OpenPipe for debugging.
*   **Customizable Defaults**: Fine-tune training parameters and inference engine configurations, or utilize pre-optimized defaults.

## RULER: Zero-Shot Agent Rewards

RULER (Relative Universal LLM-Elicited Rewards) revolutionizes agent training by eliminating the need for hand-crafted reward functions. Simply define your task in the system prompt, and RULER handles the rest‚Äî**no labeled data, expert feedback, or reward engineering required**.

[üìñ Learn more about RULER ‚Üí](https://art.openpipe.ai/fundamentals/ruler)

```python
# Before: Hours of reward engineering
def complex_reward_function(trajectory):
    # 50+ lines of careful scoring logic...
    pass

# After: One line with RULER
judged_group = await ruler_score_group(group, "openai/o3")
```

## ART Overview

ART is an open-source RL framework that enhances agent reliability by allowing LLMs to learn from experience. ART provides an ergonomic harness for integrating GRPO into any Python application. Check out the [docs](https://art.openpipe.ai) for a comprehensive guide.

## üîÅ Training Loop Explained

ART employs a client-server architecture for efficient agent training:

1.  **Inference:** Your code uses the ART client to perform an agentic workflow. Completion requests are routed to the ART server. Each `system`, `user`, and `assistant` message is stored in a Trajectory.
2.  **Training:** Trajectories are grouped and sent to the server. The server trains your model using GRPO, saves the LoRA, and loads it into vLLM.

## üß© Supported Models

ART supports most vLLM/HuggingFace-transformers compatible causal language models. If you experience any issues, please contact us on [Discord](https://discord.gg/zbBHRUpwf4) or open an issue on [GitHub](https://github.com/openpipe/art/issues)!
