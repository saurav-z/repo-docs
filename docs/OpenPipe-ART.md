## Key Features of ART:

ART is a powerful open-source framework designed to enhance the reliability and performance of your AI agents through reinforcement learning.

*   **Effortless Integration**: Seamlessly integrate ART into your existing Python applications.
*   **No Labeled Data Required**: ART learns tasks by analyzing tools and their usage, eliminating the need for extensive labeled datasets.
*   **Versatile Application**: Optimize your agents for any Model Context Protocol (MCP) server or task.
*   **Strong Performance**: Achieve state-of-the-art results, matching or exceeding benchmarks in multiple scenarios.
*   **Modular Design**: Separate client and server components for flexible training and deployment.
*   **Customizable Training**: Fine-tune training parameters and inference engine configurations to meet specific needs.

## Train Your Agents with ART:

ART offers a streamlined approach to training AI agents for various complex tasks.  This section shows the power of the ART framework through a use case for training agents to master MCPs.

### MCP‚Ä¢RL: Teach Your Agents to Master MCP

ART shines with its **MCP‚Ä¢RL** capabilities, enabling you to train agents to effectively use any MCP (Model Context Protocol) server with minimal setup.  Simply provide a server URL, and ART will:

1.  **Automate Tool Discovery**: Automatically discover server tools.
2.  **Generate Input Tasks**: Design input tasks that effectively utilize those tools.
3.  **Optimize with RULER**: Train the model to improve performance on the MCP server using RULER (Reward function using Learned Evaluation and Ranking).
4.  **Validate Performance**: Test the trained model on new tasks to ensure optimal performance.

```python
from art.rewards import ruler_score_group

# Specialize a model for NWS MCP server
MCP_SERVER_URL = "https://server.smithery.ai/@smithery-ai/national-weather-service/mcp"

# Generate training scenarios based on MCP tools
scenarios = await generate_scenarios(
    num_scenarios=24,
    server_url=MCP_SERVER_URL,
)

# ...run the agent...

# Use RULER to assign relative scores to each trajectory
scored_groups = []
for group in groups:
    judged_group = await ruler_score_group(group)
    scored_groups.append(judged_group)

# Train the model to improve performance on the MCP server
await model.train(scored_groups)
```

## üîÅ The ART Training Loop: An Overview

ART employs a client-server architecture to streamline the RL training process:

1.  **Inference:**
    *   Your code utilizes the ART client to execute agentic workflows, often running several parallel rollouts for faster data collection.
    *   Completion requests are routed to the ART server, which runs the model's latest LoRA in vLLM.
    *   Each interaction (system, user, assistant) is stored in a Trajectory.
    *   At the rollout's end, your code assigns a `reward` to the Trajectory.

2.  **Training:**
    *   When all rollouts are done, Trajectories are grouped and sent to the server. Inference is blocked during training.
    *   The server trains your model using GRPO, starting from the latest checkpoint (or an empty LoRA initially).
    *   The server saves the updated LoRA and loads it into vLLM.
    *   Inference resumes.

This loop continues for a predetermined number of iterations.

## üß© Supported Models

ART is designed to work with most vLLM/HuggingFace-transformers compatible causal language models, including those supported by [Unsloth](https://docs.unsloth.ai/get-started/all-our-models).
