## Agent Reinforcement Trainer (ART): Revolutionize LLM Agent Training with OpenPipe's Framework

**ART empowers developers to easily train and refine LLM agents for complex tasks by leveraging the power of Reinforcement Learning from Human Preferences (GRPO), resulting in more reliable and effective AI agents.** Explore the official [ART repository](https://github.com/OpenPipe/ART) for the source code and more information.

**Key Features:**

*   üöÄ **Rapid Development:**  Accelerate your agent training workflow with RULER, saving you valuable time and resources.
*   üß† **Zero-Shot Rewards with RULER:** Use the power of LLMs to generate automatic scoring for agent actions, eliminating the need for handcrafted reward functions, labels, or expert feedback.
*   üõ†Ô∏è **Simplified Integration:** Seamlessly integrate ART into your existing Python applications, and easily deploy using the provided server and client tools.
*   ‚öôÔ∏è **Customization & Optimization:** Customize training parameters, leverage intelligent defaults optimized for efficient training.
*   üåç **Versatile & Adaptable:** ART works across a wide range of tasks without modification, ensuring broad applicability.
*   üíª **Flexible Training:** Train your agents from any local client or leverage hosted platforms.
*   ‚úÖ **Observability Integrations:** Monitor your agent's performance using W&B, Langfuse, and OpenPipe.

## üìè RULER: Zero-Shot Agent Rewards

**RULER (Relative Universal LLM-Elicited Rewards)** eliminates the need for hand-crafted reward functions by using an LLM-as-judge to automatically score agent trajectories. Simply define your task in the system prompt, and RULER handles the rest‚Äî**no labeled data, expert feedback, or reward engineering required**.

‚ú® **Key Benefits:**

*   **2-3x faster development** - Skip reward function engineering entirely
*   **General-purpose** - Works across any task without modification
*   **Strong performance** - Matches or exceeds hand-crafted rewards in 3/4 benchmarks
*   **Easy integration** - Drop-in replacement for manual reward functions

```python
# Before: Hours of reward engineering
def complex_reward_function(trajectory):
    # 50+ lines of careful scoring logic...
    pass

# After: One line with RULER
judged_group = await ruler_score_group(group, "openai/o3")
```

## Why ART?

- ART provides convenient wrappers for introducing RL training into **existing applications**. We abstract the training server into a modular service that your code doesn't need to interface with.
- **Train from anywhere.** Run the ART client on your laptop and let the ART server kick off an ephemeral GPU-enabled environment, or run on a local GPU.
- Integrations with hosted platforms like W&B, Langfuse, and OpenPipe provide flexible observability and **simplify debugging**.
- ART is customizable with **intelligent defaults**. You can configure training parameters and inference engine configurations to meet specific needs, or take advantage of the defaults, which have been optimized for training efficiency and stability.

## Installation

ART agents can be trained from any client machine that runs python. To add to an existing project, run this command:

```
pip install openpipe-art
```

## üîÅ Training Loop Overview

ART's functionality is divided into a **client** and a **server**. The OpenAI-compatible client is responsible for interfacing between ART and your codebase. Using the client, you can pass messages and get completions from your LLM as it improves. The server runs independently on any machine with a GPU. It abstracts away the complexity of the inference and training portions of the RL loop while allowing for some custom configuration. An outline of the training loop is shown below:

1.  **Inference**

    1.  Your code uses the ART client to perform an agentic workflow (usually executing several rollouts in parallel to gather data faster).
    2.  Completion requests are routed to the ART server, which runs the model's latest LoRA in vLLM.
    3.  As the agent executes, each `system`, `user`, and `assistant` message is stored in a Trajectory.
    4.  When a rollout finishes, your code assigns a `reward` to its Trajectory, indicating the performance of the LLM.
2.  **Training**
    1.  When each rollout has finished, Trajectories are grouped and sent to the server. Inference is blocked while training executes.
    2.  The server trains your model using GRPO, initializing from the latest checkpoint (or an empty LoRA on the first iteration).
    3.  The server saves the newly trained LoRA to a local directory and loads it into vLLM.
    4.  Inference is unblocked and the loop resumes at step 1.

This training loop runs until a specified number of inference and training iterations have completed.

## üß© Supported Models

ART should work with most vLLM/HuggingFace-transformers compatible causal language models, or at least the ones supported by [Unsloth](https://docs.unsloth.ai/get-started/all-our-models). Gemma 3 does not appear to be supported for the time being. If any other model isn't working for you, please let us know on [Discord](https://discord.gg/zbBHRUpwf4) or open an issue on [GitHub](https://github.com/openpipe/art/issues)!
