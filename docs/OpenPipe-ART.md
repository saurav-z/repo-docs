## Key Features of Agent Reinforcement Trainer (ART)

ART is an open-source reinforcement learning framework that simplifies training LLM-powered agents.  

*   **Effortless Reward Engineering with RULER:** Utilizes RULER (Relative Universal LLM-Elicited Rewards) to automatically score agent trajectories using an LLM-as-judge, eliminating the need for manual reward functions.
*   **Accelerated Development:** RULER can speed up development by 2-3x compared to traditional methods by eliminating the time spent creating custom reward functions.
*   **Broad Applicability:** Works across various tasks without modification, offering a general-purpose solution for agent training.
*   **Strong Performance:** Achieves competitive results, matching or exceeding hand-crafted rewards in many benchmarks.
*   **Easy Integration:** Provides a simple drop-in replacement for your existing reward functions.
*   **Modular Architecture:** Separates the training loop into a client and server for flexible deployment and management.
*   **Flexible Training:** Supports training from any client machine with a GPU or by using ephemeral GPU-enabled environments for scalable training.
*   **Observability & Debugging:** Integrates with platforms like W&B, Langfuse, and OpenPipe to simplify debugging and monitoring.
*   **Optimized Defaults:** Comes with intelligent defaults that are optimized for training efficiency and stability, providing a smooth user experience.

## üìè RULER: Zero-Shot Agent Rewards

**RULER** (Relative Universal LLM-Elicited Rewards) eliminates the need for hand-crafted reward functions by using an LLM-as-judge to automatically score agent trajectories. Simply define your task in the system prompt, and RULER handles the rest‚Äî**no labeled data, expert feedback, or reward engineering required**.

‚ú® **Key Benefits:**
- **2-3x faster development** - Skip reward function engineering entirely
- **General-purpose** - Works across any task without modification
- **Strong performance** - Matches or exceeds hand-crafted rewards in 3/4 benchmarks
- **Easy integration** - Drop-in replacement for manual reward functions

```python
# Before: Hours of reward engineering
def complex_reward_function(trajectory):
    # 50+ lines of careful scoring logic...
    pass

# After: One line with RULER
judged_group = await ruler_score_group(group, "openai/o3")
```

## ART Overview

ART is an open-source RL framework that improves agent reliability by allowing LLMs to **learn from experience**. ART provides an ergonomic harness for integrating GRPO into any python application. For a quick hands-on introduction, run one of the notebooks below. When you're ready to learn more, check out the [docs](https://art.openpipe.ai).

## üîÅ Training Loop Overview

ART utilizes a client-server architecture for efficient training. Here's an outline of the training loop:

1.  **Inference:**
    1.  Your code interacts with the ART client to execute agentic workflows.
    2.  Completion requests are routed to the ART server, which runs the model's latest LoRA in vLLM.
    3.  Each interaction is stored in a Trajectory.
    4.  When a rollout is complete, the trajectory is assigned a reward.

2.  **Training:**
    1.  Trajectories are grouped and sent to the server for training.
    2.  The server trains your model using GRPO, starting from the latest checkpoint.
    3.  The server saves the trained LoRA and loads it into vLLM.
    4.  Inference resumes.

The loop continues until the specified number of iterations is complete.

## üß© Supported Models

ART is compatible with a wide range of causal language models that are supported by vLLM/HuggingFace-transformers, including models supported by [Unsloth](https://docs.unsloth.ai/get-started/all-our-models). If you encounter issues with a specific model, please report them on [Discord](https://discord.gg/zbBHRUpwf4) or [GitHub](https://github.com/openpipe/art/issues).
