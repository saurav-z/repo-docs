## Key Features of ART

*   **Zero-Shot Learning:** Train agents without the need for labeled data using innovative techniques.
*   **Versatile Applications:** Optimize models for any Model Context Protocol (MCP) server.
*   **Superior Performance:** Achieve state-of-the-art (SOTA) results in various benchmarks.
*   **Easy Integration:** Integrate seamlessly with your existing projects without requiring significant changes to your MCP server.
*   **Flexible Training:** Train locally or leverage cloud resources for efficient experimentation.

## MCP‚Ä¢RL: Reinforcement Learning for Model Context Protocols

Train agents to effectively utilize any Model Context Protocol (MCP) server.

**How it Works:**

1.  **Discover Tools:** Automatically identify and analyze the tools offered by the server.
2.  **Generate Tasks:** Design input tasks that leverage the server's tools.
3.  **Train & Improve:** Train the model to enhance performance on the MCP server using RULER (Relative Utility Learning with Efficient Rewards).
4.  **Validate Performance:** Test the trained model's effectiveness with new tasks.

```python
from art.rewards import ruler_score_group

# Specialize a model for NWS MCP server
MCP_SERVER_URL = "https://server.smithery.ai/@smithery-ai/national-weather-service/mcp"

# Generate training scenarios based on MCP tools
scenarios = await generate_scenarios(
    num_scenarios=24,
    server_url=MCP_SERVER_URL,
)

# ...run the agent...

# Use RULER to assign relative scores to each trajectory
scored_groups = []
for group in groups:
    judged_group = await ruler_score_group(group)
    scored_groups.append(judged_group)

# Train the model to improve performance on the MCP server
await model.train(scored_groups)
```

## ART Overview: RL Framework for Agent Improvement

ART is an open-source Reinforcement Learning (RL) framework designed to enhance agent reliability by enabling Language Learning Models (LLMs) to learn from experience. ART provides a streamlined interface for integrating GRPO into any Python application.

## üîÅ Training Loop Deep Dive

ART operates with a client-server architecture. The client interacts with your LLM and the server handles the RL training.

**Key Components:**

1.  **Inference:**
    *   Your code uses the ART client to perform an agentic workflow.
    *   Completion requests are routed to the ART server.
    *   Each `system`, `user`, and `assistant` message is stored in a Trajectory.
    *   A `reward` is assigned to each Trajectory.
2.  **Training:**
    *   Trajectories are grouped and sent to the server.
    *   The server trains your model using GRPO.
    *   The server saves and loads the trained model.
    *   Inference resumes.

This training loop continues until the set iterations are complete.

## üß© Supported Models

ART is designed to be compatible with most vLLM/HuggingFace-transformers-compatible causal language models.
