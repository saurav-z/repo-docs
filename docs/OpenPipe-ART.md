## Key Features of ART:

*   **Train Agents for Complex Tasks:** Easily train multi-step agents for real-world tasks using GRPO (Gradient-based Reinforcement Policy Optimization).
*   **No Labeled Data Required (for MCP‚Ä¢RL):** Leverage ART's MCP‚Ä¢RL feature to train agents without the need for extensive labeled datasets. ART analyzes tool functionality to design effective training scenarios.
*   **General-Purpose & Adaptable:** ART is designed to optimize models for a wide range of applications and is compatible with any Model Context Protocol (MCP) server.
*   **High Performance:** Achieve state-of-the-art (SOTA) results in various benchmarks.
*   **Simplified Integration:** Integrate seamlessly with existing MCP servers without requiring server-side modifications.
*   **Modular RL Training Loop:** ART provides a clear separation of client and server for easy integration and scaling.
*   **Flexible Deployment:** Run the ART client locally and leverage cloud resources for training, offering flexibility in resource allocation.
*   **Built-in Observability:** Integrate with platforms like Weights & Biases (W&B), Langfuse, and OpenPipe for robust monitoring and debugging capabilities.
*   **Customizable & Optimized Defaults:** Configure training parameters or take advantage of the intelligent defaults to ensure efficiency and stability.

## Getting Started: MCP‚Ä¢RL - Mastering Model Context Protocol Servers

ART empowers you to train agents to effectively interact with any Model Context Protocol (MCP) server, all with minimal setup.

**Here's how MCP‚Ä¢RL works:**

1.  **Automatic Tool Discovery:** ART identifies and understands the tools available on your MCP server.
2.  **Dynamic Task Generation:** Based on the discovered tools, ART designs relevant input tasks.
3.  **RL-Driven Training:** The model undergoes iterative training on the MCP server using RULER (Robust, Unified, Lightweight Evaluation of Rewards).
4.  **Performance Validation:** The trained model's performance is validated on novel tasks to ensure effectiveness.

**Example Implementation:**

```python
from art.rewards import ruler_score_group

# Specialize a model for NWS MCP server
MCP_SERVER_URL = "https://server.smithery.ai/@smithery-ai/national-weather-service/mcp"

# Generate training scenarios based on MCP tools
scenarios = await generate_scenarios(
    num_scenarios=24,
    server_url=MCP_SERVER_URL,
)

# ...run the agent...

# Use RULER to assign relative scores to each trajectory
scored_groups = []
for group in groups:
    judged_group = await ruler_score_group(group)
    scored_groups.append(judged_group)

# Train the model to improve performance on the MCP server
await model.train(scored_groups)
```

## üîÅ Training Loop Explained

ART utilizes a client-server architecture to streamline the training process:

1.  **Inference:**
    *   Your code uses the ART client for agent workflows (often running multiple rollouts in parallel).
    *   Completion requests are routed to the ART server, which runs the model's latest LoRA in vLLM.
    *   Each message (system, user, assistant) is stored in a Trajectory.
    *   Rewards are assigned to each Trajectory upon rollout completion.

2.  **Training:**
    *   Trajectories are grouped and sent to the server.
    *   The server trains the model using GRPO.
    *   The server saves the trained LoRA and loads it into vLLM.
    *   The loop repeats until the specified number of iterations.

## üß© Supported Models

ART supports most vLLM/HuggingFace-transformers compatible causal language models, particularly those supported by [Unsloth](https://docs.unsloth.ai/get-started/all-our-models).
