## Agent Reinforcement Trainer (ART): The Revolutionary Framework for LLM Agent Training

ART empowers you to train sophisticated, multi-step agents for complex real-world tasks using Gradient-based Reinforcement Policy Optimization (GRPO). This open-source framework simplifies the integration of Reinforcement Learning (RL) into your existing applications, enabling you to build more reliable and effective LLM-powered agents. **Get started today and unlock the power of self-improving agents!**  [Explore the ART repository](https://github.com/OpenPipe/ART).

**Key Features:**

*   **Easy Integration:** Seamlessly integrate RL training into your existing applications.
*   **No Labeled Data Required (MCP‚Ä¢RL):**  ART's MCP‚Ä¢RL feature learns tasks by analyzing tools on your server.
*   **General-Purpose & Flexible:** Optimizes models for any Model Context Protocol (MCP) server.
*   **State-of-the-Art Performance:** Achieves competitive or superior results in various benchmarks.
*   **Modular Architecture:**  ART divides functionality into a client and server, offering flexibility and control.
*   **Train from Anywhere:** Run ART on your local machine or leverage GPU-enabled environments.
*   **Customizable & Optimized Defaults:**  Configure training parameters or use optimized defaults for efficiency and stability.
*   **Observability and Debugging:** Integrates with platforms like W&B, Langfuse, and OpenPipe.

##  Key Use Cases & Examples

###  MCP‚Ä¢RL: Mastering Model Context Protocol Servers

Train agents to effectively utilize any MCP server with minimal setup.

```python
from art.rewards import ruler_score_group

# Specialize a model for NWS MCP server
MCP_SERVER_URL = "https://server.smithery.ai/@smithery-ai/national-weather-service/mcp"

# Generate training scenarios based on MCP tools
scenarios = await generate_scenarios(
    num_scenarios=24,
    server_url=MCP_SERVER_URL,
)

# ...run the agent...

# Use RULER to assign relative scores to each trajectory
scored_groups = []
for group in groups:
    judged_group = await ruler_score_group(group)
    scored_groups.append(judged_group)

# Train the model to improve performance on the MCP server
await model.train(scored_groups)
```

## üîÅ Training Loop Explained

ART's architecture is divided into a client and server for maximum flexibility and ease of use.

1.  **Inference:**
    *   Your code utilizes the ART client to perform an agentic workflow, often executing several rollouts in parallel.
    *   Completion requests are routed to the ART server, which runs the model's latest LoRA in vLLM.
    *   Each message is stored in a Trajectory.
    *   A `reward` is assigned to each Trajectory.
2.  **Training:**
    *   Trajectories are grouped and sent to the server.
    *   The server trains your model using GRPO, initializing from the latest checkpoint.
    *   The newly trained LoRA is saved and loaded into vLLM.
    *   Inference is unblocked and the loop resumes at step 1.

## üß© Supported Models

ART is designed to work with most vLLM/HuggingFace-transformers compatible causal language models supported by [Unsloth](https://docs.unsloth.ai/get-started/all-our-models).  If you encounter issues with a specific model, please reach out on [Discord](https://discord.gg/zbBHRUpwf4) or open an issue on [GitHub](https://github.com/openpipe/art/issues)!
