## About ART

ART (Agent Reinforcement Trainer) is an open-source reinforcement learning (RL) framework designed to improve the reliability and performance of Language Model (LLM)-powered agents by allowing them to learn from experience. ART provides a streamlined approach for integrating GRPO (Guided Reinforcement Policy Optimization) into any Python application, allowing you to train agents to perform complex, multi-step tasks.

**Key Features:**

*   **Easy Integration**: Integrate ART into existing Python applications with a simple `pip install`.
*   **No Labeled Data Required**: ART can learn from experience and doesn't require labeled datasets.
*   **General Purpose**: Optimize models for any Model Context Protocol (MCP) server or custom tasks.
*   **State-of-the-Art Performance**: Achieves or surpasses SOTA benchmarks in various tasks.
*   **Modular Architecture**: Separates client and server components for flexibility and ease of use.
*   **Flexible Training**: Train agents locally or leverage cloud resources for GPU-accelerated training.
*   **Observability**: Integrations with platforms such as W&B, Langfuse, and OpenPipe to simplify debugging.
*   **Customizable**: Configure training parameters and inference engine configurations to meet specific needs.

## Core Functionality: MCP•RL

**MCP•RL** enables training agents to effectively utilize any Model Context Protocol (MCP) server with minimal setup. You only need to provide a server URL. MCP•RL then:

1.  Automatically discovers server tools.
2.  Designs input tasks leveraging those tools.
3.  Trains the model to enhance performance on the MCP server using RULER (Reward Using Language Enhanced Relevance).
4.  Tests performance on new tasks to validate the trained model.

```python
from art.rewards import ruler_score_group

# Specialize a model for NWS MCP server
MCP_SERVER_URL = "https://server.smithery.ai/@smithery-ai/national-weather-service/mcp"

# Generate training scenarios based on MCP tools
scenarios = await generate_scenarios(
    num_scenarios=24,
    server_url=MCP_SERVER_URL,
)

# ...run the agent...

# Use RULER to assign relative scores to each trajectory
scored_groups = []
for group in groups:
    judged_group = await ruler_score_group(group)
    scored_groups.append(judged_group)

# Train the model to improve performance on the MCP server
await model.train(scored_groups)
```

## Training Loop Overview

ART's functionality is divided into a **client** and a **server**. The OpenAI-compatible client is responsible for interfacing between ART and your codebase. Using the client, you can pass messages and get completions from your LLM as it improves. The server runs independently on any machine with a GPU. It abstracts away the complexity of the inference and training portions of the RL loop while allowing for some custom configuration. An outline of the training loop is shown below:

1.  **Inference**

    1.  Your code uses the ART client to perform an agentic workflow (usually executing several rollouts in parallel to gather data faster).
    2.  Completion requests are routed to the ART server, which runs the model's latest LoRA in vLLM.
    3.  As the agent executes, each `system`, `user`, and `assistant` message is stored in a Trajectory.
    4.  When a rollout finishes, your code assigns a `reward` to its Trajectory, indicating the performance of the LLM.
2.  **Training**

    1.  When each rollout has finished, Trajectories are grouped and sent to the server. Inference is blocked while training executes.
    2.  The server trains your model using GRPO, initializing from the latest checkpoint (or an empty LoRA on the first iteration).
    3.  The server saves the newly trained LoRA to a local directory and loads it into vLLM.
    4.  Inference is unblocked and the loop resumes at step 1.

This training loop runs until a specified number of inference and training iterations have completed.
