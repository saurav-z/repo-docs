## Unleash the Power of AI Agents with Agent Reinforcement Trainer (ART)

ART is an open-source framework for training powerful AI agents that learn from experience, enabling you to build and deploy AI agents capable of complex, multi-step tasks.  **Learn how to build and deploy your own AI agents to solve complex tasks.**  See the [original repo](https://github.com/OpenPipe/ART).

### Key Features:

*   **Effortless Agent Training:** Quickly integrate ART into your Python applications.
*   **No Labeled Data Required:** Train agents using reinforcement learning without the need for pre-labeled datasets, using RULER for reward generation.
*   **General-Purpose:**  ART can optimize models for any Model Context Protocol (MCP) server or custom task.
*   **High Performance:** Achieve state-of-the-art (SOTA) results on various benchmarks.
*   **Easy Integration:**  Minimal setup required to use your existing MCP server.

### Get Started:

## How ART Works: MCP‚Ä¢RL

With ART, it's easy to train an agent to master Model Context Protocol (MCP) servers:

1.  **Automatic Tool Discovery:** ART automatically identifies and utilizes the available tools on the server.
2.  **Dynamic Input Task Generation:** ART designs input tasks that effectively leverage those tools.
3.  **Reinforcement Learning with RULER:**  The model is trained using reinforcement learning, improving its performance on the MCP server.
4.  **Validation Testing:** Performance is verified on new tasks.

```python
from art.rewards import ruler_score_group

# Specialize a model for NWS MCP server
MCP_SERVER_URL = "https://server.smithery.ai/@smithery-ai/national-weather-service/mcp"

# Generate training scenarios based on MCP tools
scenarios = await generate_scenarios(
    num_scenarios=24,
    server_url=MCP_SERVER_URL,
)

# ...run the agent...

# Use RULER to assign relative scores to each trajectory
scored_groups = []
for group in groups:
    judged_group = await ruler_score_group(group)
    scored_groups.append(judged_group)

# Train the model to improve performance on the MCP server
await model.train(scored_groups)
```

## Core Components:

ART employs a client-server architecture to handle the training process efficiently:

1.  **Client:** Your code interacts with the ART client, which handles agent workflows and communicates with the server.
2.  **Server:** Runs independently on a GPU-enabled machine, managing the inference and training processes.

**Training Loop Overview:**

1.  **Inference:** The ART client performs agent actions and sends requests to the server, which runs the latest model in vLLM.
2.  **Reward Assignment:** Trajectories are generated and given a reward based on agent performance.
3.  **Training:**  The server groups trajectories and trains the model with GRPO, initialized with the latest checkpoint, then saves the model and loads it into vLLM.
