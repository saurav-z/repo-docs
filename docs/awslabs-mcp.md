## What are AWS MCP Servers?

AWS MCP Servers expose specialized capabilities through the Model Context Protocol (MCP), an open protocol enabling seamless integration between LLM applications and external data sources and tools. These servers allow AI applications, such as coding assistants and chatbots, to access AWS documentation, guidance, and best practices through a standardized client-server architecture. This integration transforms AWS capabilities into intelligent extensions of your development environment, streamlining cloud-native development, infrastructure management, and other workflows, making AI-assisted cloud computing more efficient.

## Key Benefits:

*   **Improved Model Accuracy**: By integrating relevant information, these servers reduce hallucinations, enabling more precise code generation and ensuring that recommendations align with current AWS best practices.
*   **Accelerated Development**: Access the latest information and tools that accelerate application development.
*   **Seamless AI Integration**: Extend your AI application's capabilities using standardized client-server architecture.
