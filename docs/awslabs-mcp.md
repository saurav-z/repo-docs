AWS MCP Servers provide specialized Model Context Protocol (MCP) servers to integrate AI-powered tools with AWS services, streamlining cloud-native development, infrastructure management, and workflows.  Explore the [original repo](https://github.com/awslabs/mcp) for comprehensive details and source code.

## Key Features

*   **AI-Enhanced Development:** Integrate AI coding assistants (e.g., Amazon Q Developer, Cline, Cursor) with AWS services.
*   **Comprehensive AWS Support:** Access to AWS documentation, APIs, and best practices directly within your AI workflows.
*   **Streamlined Workflows:** Automate complex tasks using tools optimized for AWS services like CDK and Terraform.
*   **Up-to-Date Information:**  Get the latest AWS documentation and API references, ensuring your AI assistant is always current.
*   **One-Click Installs:** Easily integrate with popular AI tools (Cursor, VS Code, and more).

## Important Notice: Server Sent Events (SSE) Support Removal

**Important Notice:** On May 26th, 2025, Server Sent Events (SSE) support was removed from all MCP servers in their latest major versions. This change aligns with the Model Context Protocol specification's [backwards compatibility guidelines](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/specification/2025-03-26/basic/transports#backwards-compatibility).

We are actively working towards supporting [Streamable HTTP](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/specification/draft/basic/transports#streamable-http), which will provide improved transport capabilities for future versions.

For applications still requiring SSE support, please use the previous major version of the respective MCP server until you can migrate to alternative transport methods.

## Why AWS MCP Servers?

AWS MCP Servers dramatically improve the capabilities of foundation models:

*   **Improved Output Quality:**  Provide relevant information in context for accurate technical details, precise code, and recommendations.
*   **Access to the Latest AWS Documentation:**  Bridge the knowledge gap by integrating with the most up-to-date AWS documentation.
*   **Workflow Automation:** Turn common workflows into tools that AI assistants can use directly.
*   **Specialized Domain Knowledge:**  Offer deep insights for more effective cloud development tasks.
