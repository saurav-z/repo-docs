## MCP AWS Lambda Handler Module

A Python library is available for creating serverless HTTP handlers for the Model Context Protocol (MCP) using AWS Lambda. This module provides a flexible framework for building MCP HTTP endpoints with pluggable session management, including built-in DynamoDB support.

**Features:**

-   Easy serverless MCP HTTP handler creation using AWS Lambda
-   Pluggable session management system
-   Built-in DynamoDB session backend support
-   Customizable authentication and authorization
-   Example implementations and tests

See [`src/mcp-lambda-handler/README.md`](src/mcp-lambda-handler/README.md) for full usage, installation, and development instructions.

## When to use Local vs Remote MCP Servers?

Choose the right deployment strategy for your needs:

### Local MCP Servers

*   **Development & Testing:** Ideal for local development, testing, and debugging.
*   **Offline Work:** Continue working even with limited internet connectivity.
*   **Data Privacy:** Securely manage sensitive data and credentials locally.
*   **Low Latency:** Enjoy faster response times with minimal network overhead.
*   **Resource Control:** Maintain direct control over server resources.

### Remote MCP Servers

*   **Team Collaboration:** Share consistent server configurations across your team.
*   **Resource Intensive Tasks:** Offload heavy processing to dedicated cloud resources.
*   **Always Available:** Ensure continuous access to your MCP servers.
*   **Automatic Updates:** Get the latest features and security patches.
*   **Scalability:** Easily handle varying workloads without local limitations.

>   **Note:** Some MCP servers, like AWS Knowledge MCP, are fully managed services, removing the need for local setup.

## Installation and Setup
