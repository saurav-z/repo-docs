# Bambi: Bayesian Modeling Made Easy in Python

**Bambi is a user-friendly Python library that simplifies Bayesian model building, particularly for mixed-effects models, built on top of PyMC.**  [(See the original repository here)](https://github.com/bambinos/bambi)

## Key Features

*   **Intuitive Interface:** Easily define and fit Bayesian models using a clear and concise syntax.
*   **Built on PyMC:** Leverages the power and flexibility of the PyMC probabilistic programming framework.
*   **Mixed-Effects Modeling:** Designed for straightforward implementation of mixed-effects models common in social sciences.
*   **Seamless Integration:** Works smoothly with popular Python data analysis and visualization libraries like ArviZ, pandas, and NumPy.
*   **Flexible:** Supports various model families including linear and logistic regression.
*   **Comprehensive Documentation:**  Provides detailed [official docs](https://bambinos.github.io/bambi/index.html) and examples.

## Overview

Bambi simplifies the process of Bayesian model building in Python. It offers a high-level interface built on PyMC, making it easier to fit complex statistical models, especially mixed-effects models frequently used in fields like social sciences. Bambi takes care of the underlying complexities of Bayesian inference, allowing you to focus on your research questions.

## Installation

Bambi requires Python 3.11 or later. We recommend installing Python and core numerical libraries via the [Anaconda Distribution](https://www.anaconda.com/products/individual#Downloads).

Install Bambi using `pip`:

```bash
pip install bambi
```

For the latest development version:

```bash
pip install git+https://github.com/bambinos/bambi.git
```

### Dependencies

Bambi manages dependencies automatically. Required packages include ArviZ, formulae, NumPy, pandas, and PyMC.  These should be installed during the Bambi installation process.

## Examples

```python
import arviz as az
import bambi as bmb
import numpy as np
import pandas as pd

# Linear regression
data = bmb.load_data("sleepstudy")
data.head()
model = bmb.Model('Reaction ~ Days', data)
print(model)
results = model.fit(draws=1000)
az.summary(results)
az.plot_trace(results)
```
```

    "g": np.random.choice(["Yes", "No"], size=50),
    "x1": np.random.normal(size=50),
    "x2": np.random.normal(size=50)
})
model = bmb.Model("g['Yes'] ~ x1 + x2", data, family="bernoulli")
fitted = model.fit()
```
