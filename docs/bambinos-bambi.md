# Bambi: Simple Bayesian Model Building in Python

**Bambi simplifies Bayesian model building in Python, making it easy to analyze data with a powerful and flexible framework.**  [Visit the original repository](https://github.com/bambinos/bambi)

## Key Features

*   **Intuitive Interface:** Built on top of PyMC, Bambi provides a high-level interface for specifying and fitting Bayesian models with ease.
*   **Mixed-Effects Model Support:** Effortlessly fit mixed-effects models, common in social sciences and other fields.
*   **Flexible Modeling:**  Supports a wide range of models, including linear and logistic regression, with options for customization.
*   **Integration with ArviZ:** Seamlessly integrates with ArviZ for model diagnostics, summary, and visualization.
*   **Easy Installation:**  Install Bambi with a single `pip` command.
*   **Comprehensive Documentation:** Extensive documentation and examples to get you started quickly.

## What is Bambi?

Bambi is a Python library designed to make Bayesian model building accessible and straightforward. Built upon the robust PyMC probabilistic programming framework, Bambi offers a user-friendly interface for specifying, fitting, and analyzing a wide variety of models. It's particularly well-suited for researchers in the social sciences and related fields who frequently work with mixed-effects models.

## Installation

Install Bambi using pip:

```bash
pip install bambi
```

or to get the latest version from GitHub:

```bash
pip install git+https://github.com/bambinos/bambi.git
```

Ensure you have a working Python environment (3.11+) with the necessary dependencies like NumPy, pandas, and PyMC. The [Anaconda Distribution](https://www.anaconda.com/products/individual#Downloads) is recommended for easy setup.

## Examples

### Linear Regression

```python
import arviz as az
import bambi as bmb
import numpy as np
import pandas as pd

# Load the sleepstudy dataset
data = bmb.load_data("sleepstudy")

# Initialize and fit a model
model = bmb.Model('Reaction ~ Days', data)
results = model.fit(draws=1000)

# Summarize and visualize the results
az.summary(results)
az.plot_trace(results)
```
### Logistic Regression
```python
import pandas as pd
import numpy as np
import bambi as bmb

# Simulate some data
data = pd.DataFrame({
    "g": np.random.choice(["Yes", "No"], size=50),
    "x1": np.random.normal(size=50),
    "x2": np.random.normal(size=50)
})

# Fit a logistic regression model
model = bmb.Model("g['Yes'] ~ x1 + x2", data, family="bernoulli")
fitted = model.fit()
```
