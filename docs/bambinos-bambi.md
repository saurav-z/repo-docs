# Bambi: Bayesian Model Building in Python

**Bambi is a user-friendly Python library that simplifies Bayesian model building, making it easy to fit mixed-effects models for various research applications.**

## Key Features

*   **Intuitive Interface:** Build and fit Bayesian models with a simple, high-level API.
*   **Built on PyMC:** Leverages the power of the PyMC probabilistic programming framework.
*   **Mixed-Effects Models:** Designed for easy implementation of mixed-effects models commonly used in social sciences.
*   **Flexible:** Supports a wide range of model families and link functions.
*   **Integration with ArviZ:** Seamlessly integrates with ArviZ for model diagnostics, visualization, and results interpretation.
*   **Easy Installation:** Simple installation via pip.

## What is Bambi?

Bambi is a Python package that provides a high-level interface for building and fitting Bayesian models. It's built on top of the PyMC probabilistic programming framework, and is designed to make it extremely easy to fit mixed-effects models, which are common in social sciences settings, using a Bayesian approach. With Bambi, you can build complex models with minimal code, enabling you to focus on your research questions rather than the intricacies of model implementation.

## Installation

Bambi requires Python 3.11 or higher. We recommend using the Anaconda Distribution.

Install Bambi using pip:

```bash
pip install bambi
```

Or, install the latest development version from GitHub:

```bash
pip install git+https://github.com/bambinos/bambi.git
```

### Dependencies

Bambi relies on ArviZ, formulae, NumPy, pandas, and PyMC. These dependencies are automatically installed when you install Bambi.

## Quickstart

```python
import arviz as az
import bambi as bmb
import numpy as np
import pandas as pd

# Load sample data
data = bmb.load_data("sleepstudy")

# Define and fit the model
model = bmb.Model('Reaction ~ Days', data)
results = model.fit(draws=1000)

# Analyze the results
az.summary(results)
az.plot_trace(results)
```
See the [Quickstart](https://github.com/bambinos/bambi#quickstart) and [Examples](https://bambinos.github.io/bambi/notebooks/) for more detailed usage.

## Examples

### Linear Regression

```python
# Read in a dataset from the package content
data = bmb.load_data("sleepstudy")

# See first rows
data.head()
 
# Initialize the fixed effects only model
model = bmb.Model('Reaction ~ Days', data)

# Get model description
print(model)

# Fit the model using 1000 on each chain
results = model.fit(draws=1000)

# Key summary and diagnostic info on the model parameters
az.summary(results)

# Use ArviZ to plot the results
az.plot_trace(results)
```
``` 
   Reaction  Days  Subject

```
```

```

First, we create and build a Bambi `Model`. Then, the method `model.fit()` tells the sampler to start
running and it returns an `InferenceData` object, which can be passed to several ArviZ functions
such as `az.summary()` to get a summary of the parameters distribution and sample diagnostics or
`az.plot_trace()` to visualize them.

### Logistic Regression

```python
data = pd.DataFrame({
    "g": np.random.choice(["Yes", "No"], size=50),
    "x1": np.random.normal(size=50),
    "x2": np.random.normal(size=50)
})
```

Here we just add the `family` argument set to `"bernoulli"` to tell Bambi we are modelling a binary
response. By default, it uses a logit link. We can also use some syntax sugar to specify which event
we want to model. We just say `g['Yes']` and Bambi will understand we want to model the probability
of a `"Yes"` response. But this notation is not mandatory. If we use `"g ~ x1 + x2"`, Bambi will
pick one of the events to model and will inform us which one it picked.

```python
model = bmb.Model("g['Yes'] ~ x1 + x2", data, family="bernoulli")
fitted = model.fit()
```

After this, we can evaluate the model as before.
