# Bambi: Bayesian Modeling Made Easy in Python

**Bambi is a user-friendly Python library that simplifies Bayesian model building, making it easy to analyze data and draw insightful conclusions using the power of Bayesian statistics.**  Learn more and contribute on the [Bambi GitHub Repository](https://github.com/bambinos/bambi).

## Key Features

*   **Intuitive Interface:** Build and fit Bayesian models with a simple and familiar formula syntax.
*   **Built on PyMC:** Leverages the robust probabilistic programming capabilities of PyMC for accurate and reliable results.
*   **Mixed-Effects Models:** Easily fit complex mixed-effects models, common in social sciences and other fields.
*   **Flexible and Customizable:** Offers a wide range of customization options to tailor models to your specific needs.
*   **Integration with ArviZ:** Seamlessly integrates with ArviZ for model diagnostics, visualization, and summary statistics.
*   **Easy Installation:** Install Bambi with a single pip command.

## What is Bambi?

Bambi is a high-level Python library designed to simplify Bayesian model building. It provides a user-friendly interface for specifying and fitting Bayesian models, particularly mixed-effects models, making it easier for researchers and analysts to work with complex data and draw meaningful inferences. Bambi is built on top of the PyMC probabilistic programming framework.

## Installation

Install Bambi easily using pip:

```bash
pip install bambi
```

For the latest development version:

```bash
pip install git+https://github.com/bambinos/bambi.git
```

### Dependencies

Bambi relies on the following libraries, which are automatically installed during the installation process:

*   ArviZ
*   formulae
*   NumPy
*   pandas
*   PyMC

## Examples

### Linear Regression

```python
import arviz as az
import bambi as bmb
import numpy as np
import pandas as pd

# Load the sleepstudy dataset
data = bmb.load_data("sleepstudy")

# Display the first few rows of the data
data.head()

# Initialize and fit the model
model = bmb.Model('Reaction ~ Days', data)
results = model.fit(draws=1000)

# Summarize results and generate plots
print(model)
az.summary(results)
az.plot_trace(results)
```

### Logistic Regression

```python
data = pd.DataFrame({
    "g": np.random.choice(["Yes", "No"], size=50),
    "x1": np.random.normal(size=50),
    "x2": np.random.normal(size=50)
})

model = bmb.Model("g['Yes'] ~ x1 + x2", data, family="bernoulli")
fitted = model.fit()
```
