# Bambi: Simplified Bayesian Modeling in Python

**Bambi is a user-friendly Python library designed to simplify Bayesian model-building, especially for mixed-effects models.** ([Original Repository](https://github.com/bambinos/bambi))

## Key Features

*   **Intuitive Interface:** Easily define and fit Bayesian models using a high-level, declarative syntax.
*   **Built on PyMC:** Leverages the power of the PyMC probabilistic programming framework for robust Bayesian inference.
*   **Simplified Mixed-Effects Modeling:** Streamlines the process of building and analyzing mixed-effects models, common in social sciences.
*   **Flexible Model Specification:** Supports a wide range of models, including linear and logistic regression.
*   **Integration with ArviZ:** Seamlessly integrates with ArviZ for comprehensive model diagnostics, visualization, and interpretation.

## Overview

Bambi provides a user-friendly interface for building and analyzing Bayesian models. Built on top of PyMC, it simplifies the creation of complex models, particularly mixed-effects models, by offering a high-level syntax and a focus on ease of use.

## Installation

Bambi requires Python 3.11+ and can be installed using pip:

```bash
pip install bambi
```

Alternatively, install the development version:

```bash
pip install git+https://github.com/bambinos/bambi.git
```

### Dependencies

Bambi relies on the following Python libraries, which are automatically installed during the Bambi installation process:

*   ArviZ
*   formulae
*   NumPy
*   pandas
*   PyMC

## Examples

### Linear Regression

This example demonstrates a simple fixed-effects model using the "sleepstudy" dataset:

```python
import arviz as az
import bambi as bmb
import numpy as np
import pandas as pd

# Read in a dataset from the package content
data = bmb.load_data("sleepstudy")

# Initialize the fixed effects only model
model = bmb.Model('Reaction ~ Days', data)

# Get model description
print(model)

# Fit the model using 1000 on each chain
results = model.fit(draws=1000)

# Key summary and diagnostic info on the model parameters
az.summary(results)

# Use ArviZ to plot the results
az.plot_trace(results)
```

### Logistic Regression

This example showcases a logistic regression model using a simulated dataset:

```python
data = pd.DataFrame({
    "g": np.random.choice(["Yes", "No"], size=50),
    "x1": np.random.normal(size=50),
    "x2": np.random.normal(size=50)
})

model = bmb.Model("g['Yes'] ~ x1 + x2", data, family="bernoulli")
fitted = model.fit()
```
