# Bambi: Bayesian Model Building Made Easy in Python

**Bambi simplifies Bayesian model building, providing an intuitive interface for fitting mixed-effects models using the power of PyMC.**  Learn more and contribute at the [Bambi GitHub repository](https://github.com/bambinos/bambi).

## Key Features

*   **Simplified Bayesian Modeling:** Build and fit Bayesian models with a high-level, user-friendly interface.
*   **Built on PyMC:** Leverages the robust [PyMC](https://github.com/pymc-devs/pymc) probabilistic programming framework.
*   **Mixed-Effects Model Ready:**  Designed for ease of use with mixed-effects models, common in social sciences.
*   **Integration with ArviZ:** Seamlessly integrates with ArviZ for model diagnostics, visualization, and interpretation.
*   **Flexible and Extensible:** Easily handles various model families (e.g., Gaussian, Bernoulli) and link functions.
*   **Comprehensive Documentation:**  Access in-depth information through the [official docs](https://bambinos.github.io/bambi/index.html) and examples.

## Installation

Bambi is easy to install using pip:

```bash
pip install bambi
```

Alternatively, install the latest development version:

```bash
pip install git+https://github.com/bambinos/bambi.git
```

### Dependencies

Bambi relies on the following libraries, which are automatically installed with Bambi:

*   ArviZ
*   formulae
*   NumPy
*   pandas
*   PyMC

## Examples

Here's how to get started with Bambi:

```python
import arviz as az
import bambi as bmb
import numpy as np
import pandas as pd

# Linear regression example
data = bmb.load_data("sleepstudy")
model = bmb.Model('Reaction ~ Days', data)
results = model.fit(draws=1000)
az.summary(results)
az.plot_trace(results)

# Logistic regression example
data = pd.DataFrame({
    "g": np.random.choice(["Yes", "No"], size=50),
    "x1": np.random.normal(size=50),
    "x2": np.random.normal(size=50)
})
model = bmb.Model("g['Yes'] ~ x1 + x2", data, family="bernoulli")
fitted = model.fit()
```
