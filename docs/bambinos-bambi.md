# Bambi: Bayesian Model Building in Python

**Bambi simplifies Bayesian model building, making it easy to fit and analyze mixed-effects models using the power of PyMC.**

## Key Features

*   **User-Friendly Interface:** A high-level interface designed for intuitive model specification.
*   **Bayesian Approach:** Leverage the advantages of Bayesian statistical methods for robust inference.
*   **Mixed-Effects Model Support:** Easily fit complex models common in social sciences and other fields.
*   **Built on PyMC:** Integrates seamlessly with the powerful PyMC probabilistic programming framework.
*   **Integration with ArviZ:** Supports easy visualization and diagnostics of model results using ArviZ.
*   **Flexible and Extensible:** Easily customize models and integrate with other Python tools.

## Overview

Bambi is a Python library that provides a user-friendly interface for building and fitting Bayesian statistical models. Built on top of [PyMC](https://github.com/pymc-devs/pymc), Bambi simplifies the process of specifying and analyzing models, especially mixed-effects models, making Bayesian analysis more accessible.  

## Installation

Bambi requires Python 3.10+ and can be installed using `pip`:

```bash
pip install bambi
```

For the latest development version:

```bash
pip install git+https://github.com/bambinos/bambi.git
```

Dependencies are handled automatically during installation.

## Examples

### Linear Regression

```python
import arviz as az
import bambi as bmb
import numpy as np
import pandas as pd

# Load data
data = bmb.load_data("sleepstudy")

# Initialize the fixed effects only model
model = bmb.Model('Reaction ~ Days', data)

# Fit the model using 1000 on each chain
results = model.fit(draws=1000)

# Key summary and diagnostic info on the model parameters
az.summary(results)

# Use ArviZ to plot the results
az.plot_trace(results)
```

### Logistic Regression

```python
data = pd.DataFrame({
    "g": np.random.choice(["Yes", "No"], size=50),
    "x1": np.random.normal(size=50),
    "x2": np.random.normal(size=50)
})

model = bmb.Model("g['Yes'] ~ x1 + x2", data, family="bernoulli")
fitted = model.fit()
```
