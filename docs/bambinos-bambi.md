# Bambi: Bayesian Model Building in Python

**Bambi simplifies Bayesian statistical modeling in Python, making it easier than ever to build and analyze sophisticated models.**  ([View on GitHub](https://github.com/bambinos/bambi))

## Key Features

*   **Intuitive Interface:**  Build Bayesian models with a straightforward and user-friendly API.
*   **Built on PyMC:** Leverages the power of the PyMC probabilistic programming framework for robust Bayesian inference.
*   **Mixed-Effects Model Support:** Easily fit mixed-effects models, common in social sciences and other fields.
*   **Flexible Model Specification:** Define models using familiar formula syntax.
*   **Integration with ArviZ:**  Seamlessly integrates with ArviZ for powerful diagnostic and visualization tools.
*   **Easy Installation:** Install Bambi quickly using pip.

## Overview

Bambi is a high-level Python library designed to simplify the process of building and fitting Bayesian statistical models. Built on top of PyMC, Bambi provides an intuitive interface for specifying models, particularly mixed-effects models often used in social sciences. This allows researchers to focus on their research questions rather than getting bogged down in the complexities of Bayesian inference.

## Installation

Bambi requires Python 3.10+ and can be easily installed using pip:

```bash
pip install bambi
```

For the most up-to-date version, install directly from GitHub:

```bash
pip install git+https://github.com/bambinos/bambi.git
```

### Dependencies

Bambi relies on the following libraries, which are automatically installed during the Bambi installation process: ArviZ, formulae, NumPy, pandas, and PyMC.  Dependencies are listed in `pyproject.toml`.

## Examples

Here are basic examples to get you started:

```python
import arviz as az
import bambi as bmb
import numpy as np
import pandas as pd
```

### Linear Regression

```python
# Read in a dataset from the package content
data = bmb.load_data("sleepstudy")

# See first rows
data.head()
 
# Initialize the fixed effects only model
model = bmb.Model('Reaction ~ Days', data)

# Get model description
print(model)

# Fit the model using 1000 on each chain
results = model.fit(draws=1000)

# Key summary and diagnostic info on the model parameters
az.summary(results)

# Use ArviZ to plot the results
az.plot_trace(results)
```
```

```

### Logistic Regression

```python
data = pd.DataFrame({
    "g": np.random.choice(["Yes", "No"], size=50),
    "x1": np.random.normal(size=50),
    "x2": np.random.normal(size=50)
})
```

```python
model = bmb.Model("g['Yes'] ~ x1 + x2", data, family="bernoulli")
fitted = model.fit()
```
