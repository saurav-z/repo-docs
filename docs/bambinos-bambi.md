# Bambi: Bayesian Model Building Made Easy in Python

**Bambi is your go-to Python library for effortlessly building and fitting Bayesian mixed-effects models.**

## Key Features

*   **Intuitive Interface:** Simplifies the process of specifying and fitting Bayesian models.
*   **Built on PyMC:** Leverages the power of the PyMC probabilistic programming framework.
*   **Mixed-Effects Models:** Designed for easy implementation of mixed-effects models, common in social sciences.
*   **Easy Installation:** Install Bambi with a simple `pip install bambi`.
*   **Integration with ArviZ:** Seamlessly integrates with ArviZ for model diagnostics and visualization.
*   **Comprehensive Documentation:** Extensive documentation to guide you through the model-building process.

## Overview

Bambi provides a high-level interface for Bayesian model building in Python, built on top of the powerful [PyMC](https://github.com/pymc-devs/pymc) framework.  It is specifically designed to streamline the creation and analysis of mixed-effects models, often used in the social sciences, making Bayesian modeling accessible and efficient.

## Installation

Bambi requires Python 3.11+ and can be easily installed using pip:

```bash
pip install bambi
```

For the latest development version:

```bash
pip install git+https://github.com/bambinos/bambi.git
```

### Dependencies

Bambi automatically handles its dependencies, which are listed in `pyproject.toml`.  These include ArviZ, formulae, NumPy, pandas, and PyMC.

## Examples

Below are examples of how to build and fit a model:

```python
import arviz as az
import bambi as bmb
import numpy as np
import pandas as pd

# Linear Regression
data = bmb.load_data("sleepstudy")  # Load sample dataset

model = bmb.Model('Reaction ~ Days', data)  # Define the model
results = model.fit(draws=1000)  # Fit the model
az.summary(results)  # Summarize the results
az.plot_trace(results)  # Visualize the trace plots
```

```python
# Logistic Regression
data = pd.DataFrame({
    "g": np.random.choice(["Yes", "No"], size=50),
    "x1": np.random.normal(size=50),
    "x2": np.random.normal(size=50)
})

model = bmb.Model("g['Yes'] ~ x1 + x2", data, family="bernoulli") # Define the model
fitted = model.fit() # Fit the model
```
