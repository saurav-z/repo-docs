# Bambi: Bayesian Model Building in Python

**Bambi is a user-friendly Python library that simplifies Bayesian model building, making it easy to fit and analyze complex statistical models.**  For more details, visit the [Bambi GitHub Repository](https://github.com/bambinos/bambi).

## Key Features

*   **Intuitive Interface:**  Build and specify Bayesian models with a clear and concise syntax.
*   **Built on PyMC:** Leverages the power of the PyMC probabilistic programming framework for robust Bayesian inference.
*   **Mixed-Effects Models:** Designed for easy fitting of mixed-effects models, ideal for social science and other fields.
*   **Flexible Model Specification:** Define models using familiar formula syntax, supporting a wide range of distributions and link functions.
*   **Integration with ArviZ:** Seamlessly integrates with ArviZ for powerful model diagnostics, visualization, and summarization.
*   **Data Handling:** Works directly with Pandas DataFrames and other common data formats.
*   **Easy Installation:** Simple installation via pip.

## Getting Started

### Installation

Install Bambi with pip:

```bash
pip install bambi
```

### Examples

Here's a basic example of how to use Bambi for linear regression:

```python
import arviz as az
import bambi as bmb
import numpy as np
import pandas as pd

# Load data
data = bmb.load_data("sleepstudy")

# Build the model
model = bmb.Model('Reaction ~ Days', data)

# Fit the model
results = model.fit(draws=1000)

# Summarize the results
az.summary(results)

# Visualize the results
az.plot_trace(results)
```
