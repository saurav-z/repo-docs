# Bambi: Bayesian Model Building Made Easy in Python

**Bambi empowers researchers with a user-friendly interface for building and fitting Bayesian statistical models using Python, simplifying complex analyses.** [Explore the Bambi repo on GitHub](https://github.com/bambinos/bambi).

## Key Features of Bambi

*   **Intuitive Interface:** Build Bayesian models with a simple, high-level syntax.
*   **Built on PyMC:** Leverages the power of the PyMC probabilistic programming framework.
*   **Mixed-Effects Modeling:** Easily fit complex mixed-effects models commonly used in the social sciences.
*   **Flexible Model Specification:** Supports various model families and link functions for versatile analysis.
*   **Integration with ArviZ:** Seamlessly integrates with ArviZ for model diagnostics, visualization, and summary statistics.
*   **Easy Installation:** Install with a single `pip` command.
*   **Comprehensive Documentation:** Access detailed documentation and examples to get you started quickly.

## Installation

Bambi requires Python 3.11 or higher. It's recommended to install Python and key numerical libraries using the [Anaconda Distribution](https://www.anaconda.com/products/individual#Downloads).

Install Bambi using pip:

```bash
pip install bambi
```

Or install the latest development version from GitHub:

```bash
pip install git+https://github.com/bambinos/bambi.git
```

### Dependencies

Bambi automatically installs the following dependencies: ArviZ, formulae, NumPy, pandas, and PyMC.

## Examples

Here are a few quick examples of using Bambi:

```python
import arviz as az
import bambi as bmb
import numpy as np
import pandas as pd

# Linear regression
data = bmb.load_data("sleepstudy")
model = bmb.Model('Reaction ~ Days', data)
results = model.fit(draws=1000)
az.summary(results)
az.plot_trace(results)

# Logistic regression
data = pd.DataFrame({
    "g": np.random.choice(["Yes", "No"], size=50),
    "x1": np.random.normal(size=50),
    "x2": np.random.normal(size=50)
})
model = bmb.Model("g['Yes'] ~ x1 + x2", data, family="bernoulli")
fitted = model.fit()
```

For more in-depth examples, consult the [Quickstart](https://github.com/bambinos/bambi#quickstart) and the notebooks in the [Examples](https://bambinos.github.io/bambi/notebooks/) webpage.
