# Bambi: Simplify Bayesian Modeling in Python

**Bambi is a user-friendly Python library built on PyMC, designed to make Bayesian model building and analysis intuitive and accessible.**

## Key Features

*   **Intuitive Interface:** Build Bayesian models with a high-level, easy-to-understand syntax.
*   **Built on PyMC:** Leverage the power and flexibility of the PyMC probabilistic programming framework.
*   **Mixed-Effects Models:** Easily fit mixed-effects models commonly used in social sciences.
*   **Flexible:** Supports a wide range of model families and link functions.
*   **Integration with ArviZ:** Seamlessly integrates with ArviZ for model diagnostics, visualization, and inference.

## Overview

Bambi provides a simplified interface for building and analyzing Bayesian models. It is built on top of the powerful [PyMC](https://github.com/pymc-devs/pymc) probabilistic programming framework.  Bambi is particularly well-suited for researchers in the social sciences who want to fit mixed-effects models using a Bayesian approach.

## Installation

Bambi requires Python 3.11 or later.

### Recommended Installation with pip

```bash
pip install bambi
```

### Installing from GitHub

For the latest, development version:

```bash
pip install git+https://github.com/bambinos/bambi.git
```

### Dependencies

Bambi automatically installs its dependencies, which are listed in `pyproject.toml`. These include ArviZ, formulae, NumPy, pandas, and PyMC.

## Examples

### Linear Regression

```python
import arviz as az
import bambi as bmb
import numpy as np
import pandas as pd

# Load the example dataset
data = bmb.load_data("sleepstudy")

# Initialize the model
model = bmb.Model('Reaction ~ Days', data)

# Fit the model
results = model.fit(draws=1000)

# Summarize the results
az.summary(results)

# Visualize the results
az.plot_trace(results)
```

### Logistic Regression

```python
data = pd.DataFrame({
    "g": np.random.choice(["Yes", "No"], size=50),
    "x1": np.random.normal(size=50),
    "x2": np.random.normal(size=50)
})

model = bmb.Model("g['Yes'] ~ x1 + x2", data, family="bernoulli")
fitted = model.fit()
```
