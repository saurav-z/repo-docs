## Getting Started

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Tracecat is in active development. Expect breaking changes with releases. Review the release [changelog](https://github.com/TracecatHQ/tracecat/releases) before updating.

### Run Tracecat Locally

Get up and running quickly with a local Tracecat instance using Docker Compose.  Find full instructions [here](https://docs.tracecat.com/self-hosting/deployment-options/docker-compose).

### Run Tracecat on AWS Fargate (Advanced)

For production-ready deployments, deploy Tracecat on AWS Fargate using Terraform. View full instructions [here](https://docs.tracecat.com/self-hosting/deployment-options/aws-ecs).

Coming soon.

## Community

Join the Tracecat community for support, new integration ideas, and discussions. Connect with us on the [Tracecat Community Discord](https://discord.gg/H4XZwsYzY4).

## Tracecat Registry

![Tracecat Action template](img/action-template.svg)

The Tracecat Registry provides a library of integration and response-as-code templates, organized by common capabilities. Templates support the Open Cyber Security Schema (OCSF) to standardize data inputs.

**Explore the Registry:**

*   Discover use cases and ideas in our [documentation](https://docs.tracecat.com/self-hosting/deployment-options/docker-compose).
*   Browse existing open source templates in [our repository](https://github.com/TracecatHQ/tracecat/tree/main/packages/tracecat-registry/tracecat_registry/templates).

## Open Source vs. Enterprise

Tracecat is primarily available under the AGPL-3.0 license. Enterprise features, located in the `ee` directory, require a Tracecat Enterprise license.  These features are designed for additional functionality and include enhanced features.

*For information on Tracecat's Enterprise self-hosted or managed Cloud offering, visit [our website](https://tracecat.com) or [book a meeting](https://cal.com/team/tracecat).*

## Security

Tracecat prioritizes security with features like SSO, audit logs, and IaC deployment options (Terraform, Kubernetes/Helm).  We are developing a comprehensive threat model and security hardening recommendations.  For immediate security questions, contact us on [Discord](https://discord.gg/H4XZwsYzY4).

Report security issues to [security@tracecat.com](mailto:founders+security@tracecat.com) with `tracecat` in the subject line.
