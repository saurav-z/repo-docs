## Getting Started

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Tracecat is in active development. Expect breaking changes with releases. Review the release [changelog](https://github.com/TracecatHQ/tracecat/releases) before updating.

**Choose your deployment method:**

*   **Local Deployment (Docker Compose):**  Get started quickly by deploying a local Tracecat stack using Docker Compose.  Full instructions are available [here](https://docs.tracecat.com/self-hosting/deployment-options/docker-compose).
*   **AWS Fargate (Advanced):**  Deploy a production-ready Tracecat stack on AWS Fargate using Terraform (for advanced users). See detailed instructions [here](https://docs.tracecat.com/self-hosting/deployment-options/aws-ecs).
*   **Kubernetes (Coming Soon):**  Support for Kubernetes deployment is planned.

## Community

Join the Tracecat community for questions, feedback, and collaboration:

*   **Discord:** Connect with other users and the development team in the [Tracecat Community Discord](https://discord.gg/H4XZwsYzY4).

## Tracecat Registry: Integration Templates

![Tracecat Action template](img/action-template.svg)

The Tracecat Registry provides a curated collection of integration and response-as-code templates, simplifying common tasks.

*   **Action Ontology:** Response actions are organized using a common ontology, such as `list_alerts` and `list_cases`.
*   **OCSF Compliance:** Template inputs are normalized to align with the [Open Cyber Security Schema (OCSF)](https://schema.ocsf.io/) where possible.
*   **Example Use Cases:** Explore various use cases and gain inspiration from the documentation.
*   **Template Library:** Access open-source templates in the [Tracecat Registry](https://github.com/TracecatHQ/tracecat/tree/main/packages/tracecat-registry/tracecat_registry/templates).

## Open Source vs. Enterprise

This repository offers the open-source AGPL-3.0 licensed platform, with the exception of the `ee` directory, which contains paid enterprise features.  The Enterprise Edition provides advanced features requiring dedicated investment.

*For details on Tracecat's Enterprise self-hosted or managed Cloud offerings, visit [our website](https://tracecat.com) or [book a meeting](https://cal.com/team/tracecat).*

## Security

Tracecat is committed to security, offering features such as SSO, audit logs, and IaaC deployments (Terraform, Kubernetes/Helm) in the open-source version.

*   **Security Resources:**  A comprehensive threat model, security features, and hardening recommendations are under development. Contact us on [Discord](https://discord.gg/H4XZwsYzY4) for immediate answers.
*   **Report Security Issues:**  Report any security vulnerabilities to [security@tracecat.com](mailto:founders+security@tracecat.com) with "tracecat" in the subject line.
