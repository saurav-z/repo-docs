## Key Features

*   **API Invocation:** Enables LLMs to accurately call and utilize over 1,600 APIs, expanding their functionality.
*   **Reduced Hallucination:** Designed to minimize errors and ensure reliable API interactions.
*   **OpenFunctions:**  Offers a drop-in alternative for function calling, supporting multiple complex data types, parallel execution, and enhanced RESTful API formatting capabilities.
*   **Berkeley Function Calling Leaderboard (BFCL):** Comprehensive evaluation platform for assessing and comparing function-calling capabilities.
*   **Agent Arena:** Compare LLM agents across various models, tools, and frameworks.
*   **GoEx:** A runtime for executing LLM-generated actions with built-in safety measures.
*   **RAFT (Retrieval-Augmented Fine-tuning):** Fine-tuning recipe for domain-specific RAG.
*   **Gorilla CLI:** User-friendly command-line tool for interacting with APIs via natural language.
*   **API Zoo:** A community-maintained repository of API documentation for improved model training.

## About

Gorilla revolutionizes how LLMs utilize tools by accurately invoking APIs based on natural language queries. This repository provides the tools to run Gorilla models, evaluate results, and contribute to the API ecosystem.  Since the initial release, Gorilla has been embraced by developers worldwide and the project continues to evolve with new tools, evaluations, leaderboards, and community contributions.

### Installation Options

1.  **Gorilla CLI**
```bash
pip install gorilla-cli
gorilla generate 100 random characters into a file called test.txt
```
[Learn more about Gorilla CLI ‚Üí](https://github.com/gorilla-llm/gorilla-cli)

2.  **Run Gorilla Locally**
```bash
git clone https://github.com/ShishirPatil/gorilla.git
cd gorilla/inference
```
[Detailed local setup instructions ‚Üí](/gorilla/inference/README.md)

3.  **Use OpenFunctions**
```python
import openai

openai.api_key = "EMPTY"
openai.api_base = "http://luigi.millennium.berkeley.edu:8000/v1"

# Define your functions
functions = [{
    "name": "get_current_weather",
    "description": "Get weather in a location",
    "parameters": {
        "type": "object",
        "properties": {
            "location": {"type": "string"},
            "unit": {"type": "string", "enum": ["celsius", "fahrenheit"]}
        },
        "required": ["location"]
    }
}]

# Make API call
completion = openai.ChatCompletion.create(
    model="gorilla-openfunctions-v2",
    messages=[{"role": "user", "content": "What's the weather in San Francisco?"}],
    functions=functions
)
```

## Frequently Asked Questions

1.  **Can I use Gorilla commercially?**

    Yes! Apache 2.0 licensed models are available for commercial use without obligations.

2.  **Can I use Gorilla with tools like Langchain?**

    Absolutely! Gorilla is designed to work with agentic frameworks and tools like Langchain.

## Project Roadmap
