## About Inspect

Inspect is a powerful, open-source Python framework designed for rigorous evaluation and testing of Large Language Models (LLMs). Developed by the UK AI Safety Institute, it provides a versatile toolkit for researchers and developers to assess LLM performance across various dimensions, including prompt engineering, tool usage, multi-turn dialogue, and graded evaluations.  Extend Inspect's capabilities with custom components to support new elicitation and scoring techniques.

## Key Features of Inspect:

*   **Comprehensive Evaluation:** Assess LLMs across multiple critical areas.
*   **Prompt Engineering Support:**  Fine-tune and analyze prompts to optimize LLM outputs.
*   **Tool Usage Evaluation:**  Test and validate LLMs' ability to effectively utilize tools.
*   **Multi-Turn Dialogue Analysis:**  Evaluate LLM performance in complex conversational scenarios.
*   **Model-Graded Evaluations:**  Implement and analyze evaluations that assess model performance, including techniques for scoring and ranking.
*   **Extensible Architecture:** Easily extend Inspect's functionality through custom Python packages.
