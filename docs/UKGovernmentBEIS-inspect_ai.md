### Setting up the Development Environment

1.  **Clone the Repository:**

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/UKGovernmentBEIS/inspect_ai.git
    cd inspect_ai
    ```

2.  **Install with Development Dependencies:**

    ```bash
    pip install -e ".[dev]"
    ```

3.  **(Optional) Install Pre-commit Hooks:**  This will help maintain code quality.

    ```bash
    make hooks
    ```

### Testing and Code Quality

Ensure your code adheres to project standards by running these commands:

*   **Linting, Formatting, and Tests:**

    ```bash
    make check
    make test
    ```

### Recommended IDE Setup (VS Code)

If you're using Visual Studio Code, we recommend installing these extensions:

*   Python
*   Ruff
*   MyPy

You will be prompted to install these extensions when you open the project in VS Code.  This will help you with development by providing automatic linting, formatting, and type checking.
