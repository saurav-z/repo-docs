[<img width="295" src="https://inspect.aisi.org.uk/images/aisi-logo.svg" alt="UK AI Security Institute Logo" />](https://aisi.gov.uk/)

Inspect, developed by the [UK AI Safety Institute](https://aisi.gov.uk/), is your comprehensive framework for rigorously evaluating and improving the performance of Large Language Models (LLMs).

## **Key Features of Inspect:**

*   **Comprehensive Evaluation:** Assess LLMs using prompt engineering, tool usage, multi-turn dialog, and model-graded evaluations.
*   **Built-in Components:** Leverage pre-built tools and functionalities for a streamlined evaluation process.
*   **Extensible Architecture:** Easily integrate custom elicitation and scoring techniques through Python packages.
*   **[See the full documentation here.](https://inspect.aisi.org.uk/)**
