# Manim: Create Stunning Math Animations with Python

**Bring your mathematical ideas to life with Manim, the powerful and versatile animation engine for explanatory math videos.** ([View the Original Repo](https://github.com/ManimCommunity/manim))

Manim allows you to create precise, programmatically-generated animations, perfect for illustrating complex concepts.  This community edition is a continuation of the original project by Grant Sanderson (3Blue1Brown), and benefits from active community development, enhanced features, and improved documentation.

**Key Features:**

*   **Precise Animation Control:** Create animations with exact mathematical representations.
*   **Python-Based:** Leverage the power and flexibility of Python for animation scripting.
*   **Versatile Scene Creation:** Design complex scenes with a wide range of visual elements.
*   **Community Driven:** Benefit from a vibrant community and ongoing development.
*   **Extensive Documentation:** Comprehensive documentation to guide you through the process.

## Installation

> [!CAUTION]
> These instructions are for the community version _only_. Trying to use these instructions to install [3b1b/manim](https://github.com/3b1b/manim) or instructions there to install this version will cause problems. Read [this](https://docs.manim.community/en/stable/faq/installation.html#why-are-there-different-versions-of-manim) and decide which version you wish to install, then only follow the instructions for your desired version.

Manim requires specific dependencies before it can be used. You can try Manim [in our online Jupyter environment](https://try.manim.community/) to explore it without installing it locally.

For local installation, refer to the [official documentation](https://docs.manim.community/en/stable/installation.html) for your operating system.

## Usage

Here's a basic example of how to use Manim to create an animation:

```python
from manim import *

class SquareToCircle(Scene):
    def construct(self):
        circle = Circle()
        square = Square()
        square.flip(RIGHT)
        square.rotate(-3 * TAU / 8)
        circle.set_fill(PINK, opacity=0.5)

        self.play(Create(square))
        self.play(Transform(square, circle))
        self.play(FadeOut(square))
```

Save this code as `example.py` and then execute the following command in your terminal:

```bash
manim -p -ql example.py SquareToCircle
```

This will render a simple animation showing a square transforming into a circle. Explore the [example_scenes](example_scenes) and the [official gallery](https://docs.manim.community/en/stable/examples.html) for more advanced examples.

Manim also supports a `%%manim` IPython magic for seamless integration with JupyterLab (and classic Jupyter) notebooks. See the [documentation](https://docs.manim.community/en/stable/reference/manim.utils.ipython_magic.ManimMagic.html) and try it out [online](https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/ManimCommunity/jupyter_examples/HEAD?filepath=basic_example_scenes.ipynb).

## Command Line Arguments

The basic Manim command structure:

![manim-illustration](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ManimCommunity/manim/main/docs/source/_static/command.png)

The `-p` flag automatically opens the video after rendering. The `-ql` flag renders at a lower quality for faster processing.

Other useful flags include:

*   `-s`: Shows the final frame only.
*   `-n <number>`: Skips to the `n`th animation in a scene.
*   `-f`: Opens the file in the file browser.

For comprehensive command line options, consult the [documentation](https://docs.manim.community/en/stable/guides/configuration.html).

## Documentation

Detailed documentation is available at [ReadTheDocs](https://docs.manim.community/).

## Docker

Manim also provides a Docker image, `manimcommunity/manim`, found [on DockerHub](https://hub.docker.com/r/manimcommunity/manim).  Find installation and usage instructions in the [documentation](https://docs.manim.community/en/stable/installation/docker.html).

## Help with Manim

Need help with Manim? Reach out to our [Discord Server](https://www.manim.community/discord/) or [Reddit Community](https://www.reddit.com/r/manim). Report bugs or request features by opening an issue.

## Contributing

Contributions are welcome! The documentation and test suites especially need work.  See the [contributing guidelines](https://docs.manim.community/en/stable/contributing.html) for more information.

**Important:** Manim is currently undergoing a significant refactor. Contact us via [Discord server](https://www.manim.community/discord/) to discuss any potential contributions and stay updated.

Project developers frequently use `uv` for environment management. Refer to the [uv documentation](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/) and the [manim dev-installation guide](https://docs.manim.community/en/latest/contributing/development.html) to install manim with `uv`.
