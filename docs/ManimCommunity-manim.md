## Getting Started

### Installation

For the community version, refer to the installation instructions in the [Documentation](https://docs.manim.community/en/stable/installation.html).

### Example

Here's a simple example of how to create an animation:

```python
from manim import *

class SquareToCircle(Scene):
    def construct(self):
        circle = Circle()
        square = Square()
        square.flip(RIGHT)
        square.rotate(-3 * TAU / 8)
        circle.set_fill(PINK, opacity=0.5)

        self.play(Create(square))
        self.play(Transform(square, circle))
        self.play(FadeOut(square))
```

Save this code as `example.py` and run it from your terminal:

```bash
manim -p -ql example.py SquareToCircle
```

## Command-Line Arguments
