## Overview

[LocalStack](https://localstack.cloud) is a powerful cloud service emulator that runs in a single container, allowing you to develop and test your AWS applications and infrastructure locally.  Whether you're building serverless applications, managing infrastructure with tools like Terraform, or simply learning about AWS, LocalStack simplifies your development workflow.

LocalStack supports a broad spectrum of AWS services, including popular options like AWS Lambda, S3, DynamoDB, Kinesis, SQS, and SNS.  For a comprehensive list of supported APIs and features, visit the [Feature Coverage](https://docs.localstack.cloud/user-guide/aws/feature-coverage/) page.  The [Pro version of LocalStack](https://localstack.cloud/pricing) unlocks additional APIs and advanced features.

Explore LocalStack's [User Guides](https://docs.localstack.cloud/user-guide/) for more in-depth information.

## Install

The simplest way to get started with LocalStack is using the LocalStack CLI. Before you begin, make sure you have a working [`docker` environment](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/) installed.

### Brew (macOS or Linux with Homebrew)

Install the LocalStack CLI through our [official LocalStack Brew Tap](https://github.com/localstack/homebrew-tap):

```bash
brew install localstack/tap/localstack-cli
```

### Binary download (macOS, Linux, Windows)

If you don't have Brew, download the pre-built LocalStack CLI binary:

-   Visit [localstack/localstack-cli](https://github.com/localstack/localstack-cli/releases/latest) and download the release for your OS.
-   Extract the archive to a directory that is in your `PATH`:
    -   For macOS/Linux, use: `sudo tar xvzf ~/Downloads/localstack-cli-*-darwin-*-onefile.tar.gz -C /usr/local/bin`

### PyPI (macOS, Linux, Windows)

LocalStack is developed with Python, so install the CLI with `pip`:

```bash
python3 -m pip install localstack
```

After installing the `localstack-cli`, you'll run the Docker image containing the LocalStack runtime. To interact with local AWS services, separately install the `awslocal` CLI. See the [`awslocal` documentation](https://docs.localstack.cloud/user-guide/integrations/aws-cli/#localstack-aws-cli-awslocal) for install instructions.

> **Important**: Avoid `sudo` or running as `root`. LocalStack needs to be installed and run as a local, non-root user. For macOS High Sierra, use `pip install --user localstack`.

## Quickstart

Start LocalStack in a Docker container:

```bash
% localstack start -d
```

Check the status of services with:

```bash
% localstack status services
```

Use SQS with:

```shell
% awslocal sqs create-queue --queue-name sample-queue
```

Learn more about [LocalStack AWS services](https://docs.localstack.cloud/references/coverage/) and the `awslocal` CLI.
