## Overview

LocalStack is a cloud service emulator designed to run within a single container on your local machine or in your CI environment.  It allows you to develop and test AWS applications and Lambdas without connecting to a remote cloud provider.  Whether you're working on complex CDK applications, Terraform configurations, or just starting to learn about AWS services, LocalStack simplifies your testing and development workflow.

LocalStack supports many AWS services like Lambda, S3, DynamoDB, Kinesis, SQS, and SNS. The [Pro version](https://localstack.cloud/pricing) offers additional APIs and advanced features. See the [Feature Coverage](https://docs.localstack.cloud/user-guide/aws/feature-coverage/) page for a complete list of supported APIs.  Explore the [User Guides](https://docs.localstack.cloud/user-guide/) for more information.

## Installation

Get started with LocalStack using the LocalStack CLI. Ensure you have a functional [`docker` environment](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/) installed.

### Brew (macOS or Linux with Homebrew)

```bash
brew install localstack/tap/localstack-cli
```

### Binary Download (macOS, Linux, Windows)

1.  Visit [localstack/localstack-cli](https://github.com/localstack/localstack-cli/releases/latest) and download the latest release for your platform.
2.  Extract the archive to a directory in your `PATH` variable:
    -   macOS/Linux: `sudo tar xvzf ~/Downloads/localstack-cli-*-darwin-*-onefile.tar.gz -C /usr/local/bin`

### PyPI (macOS, Linux, Windows)

```bash
python3 -m pip install localstack
```

Install the `awslocal` CLI separately for interacting with local AWS services; see the [`awslocal` documentation](https://docs.localstack.cloud/user-guide/integrations/aws-cli/#localstack-aws-cli-awslocal).

> **Important**: Install and run LocalStack as a local, non-root user; avoid using `sudo`.  On macOS High Sierra, install with `pip install --user localstack`.

## Quickstart

Run LocalStack in a Docker container:

```bash
 % localstack start -d
```

Check service status:

```bash
% localstack status services
```

Use SQS:

```shell
% awslocal sqs create-queue --queue-name sample-queue
```
