## Overview

LocalStack is a powerful cloud service emulator designed to run in a single container, allowing you to develop and test your AWS applications locally.  This means you can develop, test, and debug your applications without connecting to the real AWS cloud, saving time and money.  Whether you're testing CDK applications, Terraform configurations, or just starting your AWS journey, LocalStack streamlines your workflow.

LocalStack supports a growing number of popular AWS services including AWS Lambda, S3, DynamoDB, Kinesis, SQS, SNS, and many more!  The [Pro version of LocalStack](https://localstack.cloud/pricing) provides even more APIs and advanced features. Check out the [Feature Coverage](https://docs.localstack.cloud/user-guide/aws/feature-coverage/) page for a detailed list of supported APIs.

## Install

The easiest way to get started is with the LocalStack CLI:

### Brew (macOS or Linux)

```bash
brew install localstack/tap/localstack-cli
```

### Binary Download (macOS, Linux, Windows)

1.  Visit [localstack/localstack-cli](https://github.com/localstack/localstack-cli/releases/latest) and download the correct binary.
2.  Extract the archive to a directory in your `PATH` (e.g., `/usr/local/bin`).

### PyPI (macOS, Linux, Windows)
