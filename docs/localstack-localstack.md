## Overview

[LocalStack](https://localstack.cloud) is a powerful cloud service emulator designed to run in a single container on your local machine or within your CI environment. This enables you to build, test, and deploy your AWS applications and Lambdas entirely on your local system, without interacting with a remote cloud provider.  Whether you're working on complex CDK applications, Terraform configurations, or simply learning the ropes of AWS services, LocalStack provides a streamlined and efficient testing and development workflow.

LocalStack offers robust support for a growing number of AWS services, like AWS Lambda, S3, DynamoDB, Kinesis, SQS, SNS, and many more. The [Pro version of LocalStack](https://localstack.cloud/pricing) offers additional APIs and advanced features. A comprehensive list of supported APIs is available on our [‚òëÔ∏è Feature Coverage](https://docs.localstack.cloud/user-guide/aws/feature-coverage/) page.

Explore LocalStack's [User Guides](https://docs.localstack.cloud/user-guide/) for further insights.

## Install

Choose your preferred installation method:

### Brew (macOS or Linux with Homebrew)

```bash
brew install localstack/tap/localstack-cli
```

### Binary download (macOS, Linux, Windows)

1.  Visit [localstack/localstack-cli](https://github.com/localstack/localstack-cli/releases/latest) and download the binary for your platform.
2.  Extract the downloaded archive to a directory included in your `PATH` variable, e.g.,:
    ```bash
    sudo tar xvzf ~/Downloads/localstack-cli-*-darwin-*-onefile.tar.gz -C /usr/local/bin
    ```

### PyPI (macOS, Linux, Windows)

```bash
python3 -m pip install localstack
```

Remember,  install and run LocalStack under a local non-root user. For help with permissions, see the provided documentation.  Install `awslocal` separately for interacting with local services. See the [`awslocal` documentation](https://docs.localstack.cloud/user-guide/integrations/aws-cli/#localstack-aws-cli-awslocal).
