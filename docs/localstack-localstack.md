## Overview

[LocalStack](https://localstack.cloud) is a powerful cloud service emulator that allows you to run AWS applications locally within a single container.  This enables you to test and develop your cloud applications (CDK applications, Terraform configurations and more) on your local machine without the need for an active cloud connection.  Simplify your testing and development workflow with LocalStack, which supports a growing number of AWS services. Explore the [Pro version of LocalStack](https://localstack.cloud/pricing) for additional features and API support, and view all supported APIs on the [‚òëÔ∏è Feature Coverage](https://docs.localstack.cloud/user-guide/aws/feature-coverage/) page. Learn more about LocalStack's [User Guides](https://docs.localstack.cloud/user-guide/)

## Install

Get started with LocalStack using the LocalStack CLI, which manages the LocalStack Docker container via your command line.  Ensure you have a working [`docker` environment](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/) installed.

### Brew (macOS or Linux with Homebrew)

Install the LocalStack CLI:

```bash
brew install localstack/tap/localstack-cli
```

### Binary download (macOS, Linux, Windows)

Download the pre-built LocalStack CLI binary.

-   Visit [localstack/localstack-cli](https://github.com/localstack/localstack-cli/releases/latest) and download the release for your platform.
-   Extract the archive to a directory included in your `PATH`:

    -   For macOS/Linux: `sudo tar xvzf ~/Downloads/localstack-cli-*-darwin-*-onefile.tar.gz -C /usr/local/bin`

### PyPI (macOS, Linux, Windows)

Install the LocalStack CLI with `pip`:

```bash
python3 -m pip install localstack
```

Install `awslocal` CLI separately for interacting with local AWS services (see [`awslocal` documentation](https://docs.localstack.cloud/user-guide/integrations/aws-cli/#localstack-aws-cli-awslocal)).

> **Important:** Install and run LocalStack under a non-root user. If you have problems with permissions in macOS High Sierra, install with `pip install --user localstack`

## Quickstart

Start LocalStack in a Docker container:

```bash
% localstack start -d
# ... (Output showing LocalStack starting) ...
```

Check service status:

```bash
% localstack status services
# ... (Output showing service status) ...
```

Use SQS:

```shell
% awslocal sqs create-queue --queue-name sample-queue
# ... (Output showing QueueUrl) ...
```

Learn more about [LocalStack AWS services](https://docs.localstack.cloud/references/coverage/) and using them with LocalStack's `awslocal` CLI.
