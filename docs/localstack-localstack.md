## Overview

[LocalStack](https://localstack.cloud) enables you to emulate a cloud environment on your local machine. This allows developers to build, test, and debug AWS applications without needing to connect to the actual cloud. It runs in a single container, simplifying the development and CI/CD processes. Whether you're building CDK applications, Terraform configurations, or just starting with AWS, LocalStack streamlines your workflow.

LocalStack supports a wide array of AWS services, with the [Pro version](https://localstack.cloud/pricing) offering even more features.  A comprehensive list of supported APIs is available on the [Feature Coverage](https://docs.localstack.cloud/user-guide/aws/feature-coverage/) page. Explore [User Guides](https://docs.localstack.cloud/user-guide/) for additional features and use cases.

## Install

The LocalStack CLI is the easiest way to get started. Make sure Docker is installed.

### Brew (macOS or Linux with Homebrew)

```bash
brew install localstack/tap/localstack-cli
```

### Binary Download (macOS, Linux, Windows)

-   Download the latest release from [localstack/localstack-cli](https://github.com/localstack/localstack-cli/releases/latest).
-   Extract the archive to a directory in your `PATH`.

### PyPI (macOS, Linux, Windows)

```bash
python3 -m pip install localstack
```

After installing `localstack-cli`, install the `awslocal` CLI separately to interact with the emulated AWS services, following the instructions in the [`awslocal` documentation](https://docs.localstack.cloud/user-guide/integrations/aws-cli/#localstack-aws-cli-awslocal).

> **Important:**  Install LocalStack as a local non-root user to avoid permission issues.

## Quickstart

Get up and running quickly with LocalStack.

```bash
 % localstack start -d
```

Check service status:

```bash
% localstack status services
```

Create an SQS queue:

```shell
% awslocal sqs create-queue --queue-name sample-queue
```
