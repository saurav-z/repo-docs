## Overview

LocalStack is a cloud service emulator that runs in a single container on your laptop or in your CI environment.  It allows you to run your AWS applications entirely on your local machine, speeding up testing and simplifying development workflows, whether you're testing complex CDK applications, Terraform configurations, or just starting with AWS.  LocalStack supports a wide range of AWS services, with the [Pro version](https://localstack.cloud/pricing) offering even more.  Explore the [Feature Coverage](https://docs.localstack.cloud/user-guide/aws/feature-coverage/) for a complete list of supported APIs.

## Install

The quickest way to get started is by using the LocalStack CLI.  Ensure you have a functional `docker` environment.

### Brew (macOS or Linux with Homebrew)

```bash
brew install localstack/tap/localstack-cli
```

### Binary download (macOS, Linux, Windows)

1.  Visit [localstack/localstack-cli](https://github.com/localstack/localstack-cli/releases/latest) and download the latest release for your platform.
2.  Extract the archive to a directory in your `PATH`.

### PyPI (macOS, Linux, Windows)

```bash
python3 -m pip install localstack
```

After installing the CLI, install the `awslocal` CLI separately to interact with local AWS services. Refer to the [`awslocal` documentation](https://docs.localstack.cloud/user-guide/integrations/aws-cli/#localstack-aws-cli-awslocal) for installation guidance.

> **Important**: Do not use `sudo` or run as `root` user. Install and start LocalStack under a local non-root user.  For macOS High Sierra permission issues, install with `pip install --user localstack`.

## Quickstart

Start LocalStack in Docker mode:

```bash
 % localstack start -d
```

Check service status:

```bash
% localstack status services
```

Create an SQS queue:

```shell
% awslocal sqs create-queue --queue-name sample-queue
```

Learn more about [LocalStack AWS services](https://docs.localstack.cloud/references/coverage/) and how to use them with the `awslocal` CLI.
