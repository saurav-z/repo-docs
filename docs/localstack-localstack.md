## Installation

Get started with LocalStack using the following methods:

### LocalStack CLI

The LocalStack CLI allows you to start and manage the LocalStack Docker container directly from your command line.

**Prerequisites:** A functional [`docker` environment](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/) installed.

#### Brew (macOS or Linux with Homebrew)

```bash
brew install localstack/tap/localstack-cli
```

#### Binary download (macOS, Linux, Windows)

1.  Visit [localstack/localstack-cli](https://github.com/localstack/localstack-cli/releases/latest) and download the latest release for your platform.
2.  Extract the downloaded archive to a directory included in your `PATH` variable:
    -   For macOS/Linux, use the command: `sudo tar xvzf ~/Downloads/localstack-cli-*-darwin-*-onefile.tar.gz -C /usr/local/bin`

#### PyPI (macOS, Linux, Windows)

```bash
python3 -m pip install localstack
```

The `localstack-cli` installation enables you to run the Docker image containing the LocalStack runtime. To interact with the local AWS services, you need to install the `awslocal` CLI separately. For installation guidelines, refer to the [`awslocal` documentation](https://docs.localstack.cloud/user-guide/integrations/aws-cli/#localstack-aws-cli-awslocal).

> **Important**: Do not use `sudo` or run as `root` user. LocalStack must be installed and started entirely under a local non-root user. If you have problems with permissions in macOS High Sierra, install with `pip install --user localstack`

### Docker

See the [Docker documentation](https://docs.localstack.cloud/getting-started/installation/#docker) for details.

### Docker Compose

See the [Docker Compose documentation](https://docs.localstack.cloud/getting-started/installation/#docker-compose) for details.

### Helm

See the [Helm documentation](https://docs.localstack.cloud/getting-started/installation/#helm) for details.

## Quickstart

Start LocalStack in Docker mode:

```bash
% localstack start -d
```

Check service status:

```bash
% localstack status services
```

Create an SQS queue:

```shell
% awslocal sqs create-queue --queue-name sample-queue
```

Learn more about [LocalStack AWS services](https://docs.localstack.cloud/references/coverage/) and using them with LocalStack's `awslocal` CLI.
