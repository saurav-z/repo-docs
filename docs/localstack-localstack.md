## Overview

LocalStack provides a fully functional local cloud stack, enabling developers to emulate AWS services on their local machine or within a CI environment. This allows for rapid development, testing, and debugging of AWS applications without incurring cloud costs or waiting for deployments. It supports a growing number of AWS services, allowing you to test complex applications locally before deploying them to the cloud.  The Pro version extends this further with additional APIs and features.

## Install

Choose your preferred method to install LocalStack:

### LocalStack CLI (Recommended)

The quickest way to get started is with the LocalStack CLI, which simplifies starting and managing the LocalStack Docker container. Ensure you have a working [`docker` environment](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/) installed first.

#### Brew (macOS or Linux with Homebrew)

```bash
brew install localstack/tap/localstack-cli
```

#### Binary download (macOS, Linux, Windows)

1.  Visit [localstack/localstack-cli](https://github.com/localstack/localstack-cli/releases/latest) and download the release for your platform.
2.  Extract the archive to a directory in your `PATH` variable. For example: `sudo tar xvzf ~/Downloads/localstack-cli-*-darwin-*-onefile.tar.gz -C /usr/local/bin`

#### PyPI (macOS, Linux, Windows)

```bash
python3 -m pip install localstack
```

After installing the `localstack-cli`, you'll also need the `awslocal` CLI to interact with the local AWS services; refer to the [`awslocal` documentation](https://docs.localstack.cloud/user-guide/integrations/aws-cli/#localstack-aws-cli-awslocal).

> **Important**: Avoid using `sudo` or running as `root`. LocalStack should be installed and started under a local, non-root user. If you have issues in macOS High Sierra, try `pip install --user localstack`.

## Quickstart

Start LocalStack in a Docker container:

```bash
 % localstack start -d
 # Output similar to the example in original README
```

Check service status:

```bash
% localstack status services
# Output similar to the example in original README
```

Create an SQS queue:

```shell
% awslocal sqs create-queue --queue-name sample-queue
# Output similar to the example in original README
```

For more information, consult our [LocalStack AWS services](https://docs.localstack.cloud/references/coverage/) documentation and how to use them with the `awslocal` CLI.
