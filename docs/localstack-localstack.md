## Overview

[LocalStack](https://localstack.cloud) provides a fully functional cloud service emulator, enabling you to develop and test your AWS applications locally.  This allows you to iterate faster, test more reliably, and reduce costs by eliminating the need to interact with a remote cloud provider during development and testing. Whether you're building serverless applications with AWS Lambda, managing data with S3 and DynamoDB, or orchestrating workflows with SQS and SNS, LocalStack offers a comprehensive local environment for your cloud development needs.  The [Pro version of LocalStack](https://localstack.cloud/pricing) provides extended API support and advanced features. Check out the [Feature Coverage](https://docs.localstack.cloud/user-guide/aws/feature-coverage/) page for a complete list.

## Install

Install LocalStack using one of the following methods:

### Brew (macOS or Linux with Homebrew)

```bash
brew install localstack/tap/localstack-cli
```

### Binary Download (macOS, Linux, Windows)

1.  Visit [localstack/localstack-cli](https://github.com/localstack/localstack-cli/releases/latest) and download the correct release.
2.  Extract the archive to a directory in your `PATH`:
    -   macOS/Linux: `sudo tar xvzf ~/Downloads/localstack-cli-*-darwin-*-onefile.tar.gz -C /usr/local/bin`

### PyPI (macOS, Linux, Windows)

```bash
python3 -m pip install localstack
```

The `localstack-cli` starts the Docker image. For interacting with the local AWS services, install `awslocal` separately (see [`awslocal` documentation](https://docs.localstack.cloud/user-guide/integrations/aws-cli/#localstack-aws-cli-awslocal)).

> **Important**: Avoid using `sudo` or running as `root`. Install and run LocalStack with a non-root user. If experiencing permissions issues on macOS High Sierra, install with `pip install --user localstack`.

## Quickstart

Start LocalStack in Docker:

```bash
 % localstack start -d
 # ... output ...
```

Check service status:

```bash
% localstack status services
# ... output ...
```

Use SQS:

```shell
% awslocal sqs create-queue --queue-name sample-queue
# ... output ...
```
