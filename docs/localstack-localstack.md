## Overview

LocalStack ([localstack.cloud](https://localstack.cloud)) is a cloud service emulator that runs in a single container, allowing you to develop and test your AWS applications locally, efficiently and without the need for a remote cloud provider.  Whether you're testing complex CDK applications or Terraform configurations, or just beginning to learn about AWS services, LocalStack helps speed up and simplify your testing and development workflow.

## Install

Choose your preferred installation method:

### Install via LocalStack CLI

The quickest way to get started with LocalStack is by using the LocalStack CLI. Ensure that your machine has a functional [`docker` environment](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/) installed before proceeding.

#### Brew (macOS or Linux with Homebrew)

Install the LocalStack CLI through our [official LocalStack Brew Tap](https://github.com/localstack/homebrew-tap):

```bash
brew install localstack/tap/localstack-cli
```

#### Binary download (macOS, Linux, Windows)

If Brew is not installed on your machine, you can download the pre-built LocalStack CLI binary directly:

- Visit [localstack/localstack-cli](https://github.com/localstack/localstack-cli/releases/latest) and download the latest release for your platform.
- Extract the downloaded archive to a directory included in your `PATH` variable:
    -   For macOS/Linux, use the command: `sudo tar xvzf ~/Downloads/localstack-cli-*-darwin-*-onefile.tar.gz -C /usr/local/bin`

#### PyPI (macOS, Linux, Windows)

LocalStack is developed using Python. To install the LocalStack CLI using `pip`, run the following command:

```bash
python3 -m pip install localstack
```

The `localstack-cli` installation enables you to run the Docker image containing the LocalStack runtime. To interact with the local AWS services, you need to install the `awslocal` CLI separately. For installation guidelines, refer to the [`awslocal` documentation](https://docs.localstack.cloud/user-guide/integrations/aws-cli/#localstack-aws-cli-awslocal).

> **Important**: Do not use `sudo` or run as `root` user. LocalStack must be installed and started entirely under a local non-root user. If you have problems with permissions in macOS High Sierra, install with `pip install --user localstack`

## Quickstart

Get started with LocalStack inside a Docker container:

```bash
 % localstack start -d
```

Check service statuses:

```bash
% localstack status services
```

Use SQS:

```shell
% awslocal sqs create-queue --queue-name sample-queue
```

For more details on using LocalStack AWS services, consult the [documentation](https://docs.localstack.cloud/references/coverage/).
