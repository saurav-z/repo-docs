## Overview

[LocalStack](https://localstack.cloud) is a powerful cloud service emulator that allows developers to develop and test AWS applications locally. It runs within a single container, enabling you to simulate a complete AWS environment on your laptop or in your CI/CD environment. This allows you to test everything from complex CDK applications and Terraform configurations to getting started with AWS services - all locally.  This improves developer productivity and accelerates your development workflow.

LocalStack supports a growing list of AWS services, enabling you to test your applications without a live internet connection.  Check out the [feature coverage](https://docs.localstack.cloud/user-guide/aws/feature-coverage/) to see supported APIs.

## Installation

Get started by installing the LocalStack CLI. Make sure you have a functional Docker environment.

### Brew (macOS or Linux with Homebrew)

```bash
brew install localstack/tap/localstack-cli
```

### Binary download (macOS, Linux, Windows)

1.  Visit [localstack/localstack-cli](https://github.com/localstack/localstack-cli/releases/latest) and download the latest release.
2.  Extract the archive to a directory in your `PATH`.

### PyPI (macOS, Linux, Windows)

```bash
python3 -m pip install localstack
```

After installing the LocalStack CLI, install the `awslocal` CLI separately.  See the [`awslocal` documentation](https://docs.localstack.cloud/user-guide/integrations/aws-cli/#localstack-aws-cli-awslocal) for installation instructions.
