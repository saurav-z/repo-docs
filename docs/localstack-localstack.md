## Overview

[LocalStack](https://localstack.cloud) is a powerful cloud service emulator that enables you to develop and test your AWS applications locally. It runs in a single container, letting you build and test AWS applications and Lambdas on your local machine without connecting to a remote cloud provider. From testing complex CDK applications and Terraform configurations to learning about AWS services, LocalStack accelerates your development workflow.

LocalStack supports a growing number of AWS services, including AWS Lambda, S3, DynamoDB, Kinesis, SQS, SNS, and many more. The [Pro version of LocalStack](https://localstack.cloud/pricing) offers additional APIs and advanced features. Explore the comprehensive list of supported APIs on our [Feature Coverage](https://docs.localstack.cloud/user-guide/aws/feature-coverage/) page.

Additional features include:

*   [User Guides](https://docs.localstack.cloud/user-guide/)
*   [LocalStack Web Application](https://app.localstack.cloud)
*   [LocalStack Desktop](https://docs.localstack.cloud/user-guide/tools/localstack-desktop/)
*   [LocalStack Docker Extension](https://docs.localstack.cloud/user-guide/tools/localstack-docker-extension/)

## Install

The LocalStack CLI is the easiest way to get started. Ensure you have Docker installed.

### Brew (macOS or Linux with Homebrew)

```bash
brew install localstack/tap/localstack-cli
```

### Binary Download (macOS, Linux, Windows)

1.  Download the latest release from [localstack/localstack-cli](https://github.com/localstack/localstack-cli/releases/latest).
2.  Extract the archive to a directory in your `PATH`.

    *   macOS/Linux: `sudo tar xvzf ~/Downloads/localstack-cli-*-darwin-*-onefile.tar.gz -C /usr/local/bin`

### PyPI (macOS, Linux, Windows)

```bash
python3 -m pip install localstack
```

Install `awslocal` separately for interacting with local AWS services; see the [`awslocal` documentation](https://docs.localstack.cloud/user-guide/integrations/aws-cli/#localstack-aws-cli-awslocal).

> **Important:** Do not use `sudo` or run as root. Install and run LocalStack under a local, non-root user. If you have macOS High Sierra permissions issues, use `pip install --user localstack`.

---

## Quickstart

Start LocalStack in a Docker container:

```bash
 % localstack start -d
```

Check service status:

```

Create an SQS queue:
