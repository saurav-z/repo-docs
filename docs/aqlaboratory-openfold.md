# OpenFold: Reproducing AlphaFold 2 for Protein Structure Prediction

**OpenFold is a PyTorch implementation designed to faithfully replicate DeepMind's AlphaFold 2, providing a trainable platform for protein structure prediction.**

[View the original repository on GitHub](https://github.com/aqlaboratory/openfold)

## Key Features

*   **Faithful Reproduction:** OpenFold aims to replicate the architecture and functionality of AlphaFold 2.
*   **Trainable Model:** Allows users to train and fine-tune the model on custom datasets.
*   **Open Source:** Built upon the Apache License, Version 2.0.
*   **Comprehensive Documentation:** Detailed instructions for installation, inference, and training can be found at [openfold.readthedocs.io](https://openfold.readthedocs.io/en/latest/).

## Getting Started
