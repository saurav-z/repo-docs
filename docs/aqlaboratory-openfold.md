# OpenFold: Reproducing and Extending AlphaFold 2 for Protein Structure Prediction

OpenFold is a PyTorch-based, trainable reproduction of DeepMind's groundbreaking [AlphaFold 2](https://github.com/deepmind/alphafold), empowering researchers with the ability to explore and expand upon the state-of-the-art in protein structure prediction.

## Key Features

*   **Faithful Reproduction:** OpenFold faithfully replicates the architecture and training procedures of AlphaFold 2.
*   **Trainable:**  Unlike the original AlphaFold 2, OpenFold's components are fully trainable, enabling researchers to customize and adapt the model.
*   **Open Source:**  OpenFold is open-source, promoting collaboration and advancement in the field of protein structure prediction.
*   **Extensible:** Built with flexibility in mind, OpenFold allows researchers to experiment with different architectures, training data, and loss functions.

## Getting Started

*   **Documentation:** Comprehensive documentation, including installation instructions, model inference, and training guides, is available at [openfold.readthedocs.io](https://openfold.readthedocs.io/en/latest/).
*   **Source Code:**  Explore the original repository for the latest code and updates: [https://github.com/aqlaboratory/openfold](https://github.com/aqlaboratory/openfold)
