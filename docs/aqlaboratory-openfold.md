# OpenFold: Replicating AlphaFold 2 for Protein Structure Prediction

OpenFold is a powerful, trainable, and open-source implementation of DeepMind's groundbreaking [AlphaFold 2](https://github.com/deepmind/alphafold), empowering researchers to explore protein structure prediction with unprecedented accuracy.

## Key Features of OpenFold

*   **Faithful Reproduction:** OpenFold accurately replicates the architecture and functionality of AlphaFold 2, providing a solid foundation for research and development.
*   **Trainable Model:**  Fine-tune and adapt OpenFold to your specific needs by training it on custom datasets, opening up possibilities for specialized applications.
*   **Open Source:** Leverage the flexibility of open-source code to modify, extend, and integrate OpenFold into your existing workflows.
*   **Detailed Documentation:** Access comprehensive documentation at [openfold.readthedocs.io](https://openfold.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) for installation, model inference, and training.

## Getting Started
