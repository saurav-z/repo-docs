# OpenFold: Replicating AlphaFold 2 for Protein Structure Prediction

**OpenFold** is a powerful, trainable PyTorch implementation of DeepMind's groundbreaking [AlphaFold 2](https://github.com/deepmind/alphafold) that empowers researchers to explore protein structure prediction and its underlying mechanisms.

## Key Features

*   **Faithful Reproduction:** Built to mirror the architecture and functionality of AlphaFold 2.
*   **Trainable Models:**  Enables researchers to fine-tune and experiment with the model.
*   **Open Source:** Freely available under the Apache License, Version 2.0, promoting collaboration and innovation.
*   **Detailed Documentation:** Comprehensive documentation available at [openfold.readthedocs.io](https://openfold.readthedocs.io/en/latest/), including installation and usage instructions.

## Getting Started
