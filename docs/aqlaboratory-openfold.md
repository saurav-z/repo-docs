# OpenFold: Replicating AlphaFold 2 for Protein Structure Prediction

**OpenFold is a powerful, open-source PyTorch implementation of DeepMind's AlphaFold 2, enabling researchers to explore and advance the field of protein structure prediction.**

[Go to the original repository](https://github.com/aqlaboratory/openfold)

## Key Features

*   **Faithful Reproduction:** OpenFold accurately replicates the architecture and functionality of AlphaFold 2.
*   **Trainable Model:** Unlike the original, OpenFold allows for training and fine-tuning, offering new avenues for research.
*   **Open Source:** Built on PyTorch, OpenFold provides researchers with accessible, customizable tools for protein structure prediction.
*   **Detailed Documentation:** Comprehensive documentation is available at [openfold.readthedocs.io](https://openfold.readthedocs.io/en/latest/), including installation instructions, model inference, and training guides.

## Why Use OpenFold?

OpenFold empowers researchers to:

*   Investigate the inner workings of AlphaFold 2.
*   Explore new training strategies and architectures.
*   Adapt the model to specific research needs.

## Copyright and Licensing

*   OpenFold is licensed under the Apache License, Version 2.0.
*   Pretrained parameters are under the CC BY 4.0 license and are downloaded by the installation script.
