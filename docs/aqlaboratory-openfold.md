# OpenFold: Replicating AlphaFold 2 for Protein Structure Prediction

OpenFold is a faithful and trainable PyTorch reproduction of DeepMind's groundbreaking [AlphaFold 2](https://github.com/deepmind/alphafold), empowering researchers to explore protein structure prediction.

**Key Features:**

*   **Faithful Reproduction:** Mimics the architecture and functionality of AlphaFold 2.
*   **Trainable:** Allows for fine-tuning and experimentation with the model.
*   **Open Source:** Released under the Apache License, Version 2.0.

## Getting Started

For detailed instructions on installation, model inference, and training, please refer to the official documentation at [openfold.readthedocs.io](https://openfold.readthedocs.io/en/latest/).

## Copyright and Licensing

OpenFold's source code is licensed under the permissive Apache License, Version 2.0.  Pretrained parameters are licensed under CC BY 4.0, and are downloaded by the installation script.
