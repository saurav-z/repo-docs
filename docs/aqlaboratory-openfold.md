# OpenFold: Reproducing AlphaFold 2 for Protein Structure Prediction

**OpenFold provides a trainable, open-source implementation of DeepMind's groundbreaking AlphaFold 2, empowering researchers with the tools to explore and advance protein structure prediction.** This allows researchers to study protein structures.

[View the original repository on GitHub](https://github.com/aqlaboratory/openfold)

## Key Features

*   **Faithful Reproduction:** OpenFold is built as a faithful PyTorch reproduction of AlphaFold 2, offering a transparent and accessible implementation.
*   **Trainable Model:** Unlike the original, OpenFold allows for training, enabling researchers to fine-tune and adapt the model for specific research needs.
*   **Open Source:** Benefit from a community-driven project, fostering collaboration and innovation in the field of protein structure prediction.
*   **Extensive Documentation:** Detailed instructions for installation, model inference, and training can be found at [openfold.readthedocs.io](https://openfold.readthedocs.io/en/latest/).
