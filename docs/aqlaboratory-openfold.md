# OpenFold: Replicating AlphaFold 2 for Protein Structure Prediction

**OpenFold is a trainable and open-source PyTorch implementation of DeepMind's groundbreaking AlphaFold 2, empowering researchers with accessible protein structure prediction capabilities.**

## Key Features

*   **Faithful Reproduction:** OpenFold provides a close replication of the AlphaFold 2 architecture.
*   **Trainable Model:** The PyTorch implementation allows for training and fine-tuning the model on custom datasets.
*   **Open Source:** Explore and contribute to the code, fostering collaboration and innovation in protein structure prediction.

## Getting Started

For comprehensive instructions on installation, model inference, and training, please refer to our detailed documentation: [openfold.readthedocs.io](https://openfold.readthedocs.io/en/latest/).

## Important Information

*   **Copyright & Licensing:** OpenFold's source code is licensed under the Apache License, Version 2.0.  The pretrained parameters, obtained during installation, are licensed under CC BY 4.0.
