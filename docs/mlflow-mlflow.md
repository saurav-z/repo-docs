![Integrations](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/mlflow/mlflow/refs/heads/master/assets/readme-integrations.png)

## Usage Examples

### Experiment Tracking

*   **[Documentation](https://mlflow.org/docs/latest/ml/tracking/)**

The following examples trains a simple regression model with scikit-learn, while enabling MLflow's [autologging](https://mlflow.org/docs/latest/tracking/autolog.html) feature for experiment tracking.

```python
import mlflow

from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split
from sklearn.datasets import load_diabetes
from sklearn.ensemble import RandomForestRegressor

# Enable MLflow's automatic experiment tracking for scikit-learn
mlflow.sklearn.autolog()

# Load the training dataset
db = load_diabetes()
X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(db.data, db.target)

rf = RandomForestRegressor(n_estimators=100, max_depth=6, max_features=3)
# MLflow triggers logging automatically upon model fitting
rf.fit(X_train, y_train)
```

To view the results, run the following command and access the MLflow UI via the URL:

```bash
mlflow ui
```

### Evaluating Models

*   **[Documentation](https://mlflow.org/docs/latest/model-evaluation/index.html)**

```python
import mlflow
import pandas as pd

# Evaluation set contains (1) input question (2) model outputs (3) ground truth
df = pd.DataFrame(
    {
        "inputs": ["What is MLflow?", "What is Spark?"],
        "outputs": [
            "MLflow is an innovative fully self-driving airship powered by AI.",
            "Sparks is an American pop and rock duo formed in Los Angeles.",
        ],
        "ground_truth": [
            "MLflow is an open-source platform for productionizing AI.",
            "Apache Spark is an open-source, distributed computing system.",
        ],
    }
)
eval_dataset = mlflow.data.from_pandas(
    df, predictions="outputs", targets="ground_truth"
)

# Start an MLflow Run to record the evaluation results to
with mlflow.start_run(run_name="evaluate_qa"):
    # Run automatic evaluation with a set of built-in metrics for question-answering models
    results = mlflow.evaluate(
        data=eval_dataset,
        model_type="question-answering",
    )

print(results.tables["eval_results_table"])
```

### Observability

*   **[Documentation](https://mlflow.org/docs/latest/llms/tracing/index.html)**

```python
import mlflow
from openai import OpenAI

# Enable tracing for OpenAI
mlflow.openai.autolog()

# Query OpenAI LLM normally
response = OpenAI().chat.completions.create(
    model="gpt-4o-mini",
    messages=[{"role": "user", "content": "Hi!"}],
    temperature=0.1,
)
```

Navigate to the "Traces" tab in the MLflow UI to find the trace records OpenAI query.

Key improvements and SEO considerations:

*   **Concise Hook:**  Replaced the longer introductory sentences with a clear, one-sentence hook.  Keywords like "AI lifecycle" are included.
*   **Keyword Optimization:**  Strategically used keywords like "AI/LLM applications," "experiment tracking," "model registry," and "deployment" throughout the headings and key features.
*   **Clear Headings:** Used HTML heading tags (<h1>, <h2>, etc.) to organize the content and improve readability for both humans and search engines.
*   **Bulleted Key Features:**  Highlights the core functionalities in a concise, easy-to-scan format.  Each bullet point acts as a concise description, incorporating relevant keywords.
*   **Documentation Links:**  Added [Back to the top](#mlflow-the-open-source-platform-for-the-ai-lifecycle) for enhanced navigation
*   **Installation Section:** This section is separate and early in the document, so it is easier for a new user to quickly find and use.
*   **Call to action and links to the core repo**.
*   **Removed Redundancy:**  Trimmed unnecessary wording to make it more direct and impactful.
