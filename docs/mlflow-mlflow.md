## Key Features

MLflow provides a unified platform to streamline the entire AI/ML lifecycle, including LLMs, Agents, Deep Learning, and traditional machine learning.

*   **Experiment Tracking:** Track and compare your ML model parameters, metrics, and results in a centralized interface.
*   **LLM Tracing and Observability:** Deeply monitor the internal states and performance of your LLM/agentic applications, enabling easier debugging and performance monitoring.
*   **LLM Evaluation:** Automate model evaluation using a suite of tools integrated with experiment tracking for easy comparison of different model versions.
*   **Prompt Management:** Version, track, and reuse prompts for consistent AI application development and collaboration.
*   **App Version Tracking:** Maintain end-to-end lineage and track all components of your AI applications, including models, prompts, tools, and code.
*   **Model Registry:** Centralized model store to manage the full lifecycle and deployment of machine learning models collaboratively.
*   **Model Deployment:** Deploy models seamlessly for batch and real-time scoring on diverse platforms like Docker, Kubernetes, Azure ML, and AWS SageMaker.
*   **Integrations:** Native integrations with popular ML frameworks and GenAI libraries.

## üöÄ Installation

To install the MLflow Python package, run:

```bash
pip install mlflow
```

*   Nebius

For self-hosting instructions, see the [official documentation](https://mlflow.org/docs/latest/ml/tracking/#tracking-setup).

## üó£Ô∏è Supported Programming Languages

*   Python
*   TypeScript / JavaScript
*   Java
*   R

## üîó Integrations

MLflow integrates seamlessly with many popular machine learning frameworks and GenAI libraries, as shown in the image below:

![Integrations](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/mlflow/mlflow/refs/heads/master/assets/readme-integrations.png)

## üßë‚Äçüíª Usage Examples

### Experiment Tracking

```python
import mlflow

from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split
from sklearn.datasets import load_diabetes
from sklearn.ensemble import RandomForestRegressor

# Enable MLflow's automatic experiment tracking for scikit-learn
mlflow.sklearn.autolog()

# Load the training dataset
db = load_diabetes()
X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(db.data, db.target)

rf = RandomForestRegressor(n_estimators=100, max_depth=6, max_features=3)
# MLflow triggers logging automatically upon model fitting
rf.fit(X_train, y_train)
```

After running the code above, execute `mlflow ui` in a separate terminal and access the MLflow UI via the provided URL to view your MLflow **Run**.

### Evaluating Models

```python
import mlflow
import pandas as pd

# Evaluation set contains (1) input question (2) model outputs (3) ground truth
df = pd.DataFrame(
    {
        "inputs": ["What is MLflow?", "What is Spark?"],
        "outputs": [
            "MLflow is an innovative fully self-driving airship powered by AI.",
            "Sparks is an American pop and rock duo formed in Los Angeles.",
        ],
        "ground_truth": [
            "MLflow is an open-source platform for productionizing AI.",
            "Apache Spark is an open-source, distributed computing system.",
        ],
    }
)
eval_dataset = mlflow.data.from_pandas(
    df, predictions="outputs", targets="ground_truth"
)

# Start an MLflow Run to record the evaluation results to
with mlflow.start_run(run_name="evaluate_qa"):
    # Run automatic evaluation with a set of built-in metrics for question-answering models
    results = mlflow.evaluate(
        data=eval_dataset,
        model_type="question-answering",
    )

print(results.tables["eval_results_table"])
```

### Observability

```python
import mlflow
from openai import OpenAI

# Enable tracing for OpenAI
mlflow.openai.autolog()

# Query OpenAI LLM normally
response = OpenAI().chat.completions.create(
    model="gpt-4o-mini",
    messages=[{"role": "user", "content": "Hi!"}],
    temperature=0.1,
)
```

After executing this code, you can view the trace records in the "Traces" tab of the MLflow UI.
