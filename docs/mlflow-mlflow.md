![Integrations](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/mlflow/mlflow/refs/heads/master/assets/readme-integrations.png)

## Usage Examples

### Experiment Tracking

```python
import mlflow
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split
from sklearn.datasets import load_diabetes
from sklearn.ensemble import RandomForestRegressor

mlflow.sklearn.autolog()

db = load_diabetes()
X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(db.data, db.target)

rf = RandomForestRegressor(n_estimators=100, max_depth=6, max_features=3)
rf.fit(X_train, y_train)
```

Run `mlflow ui` in a separate terminal to view the results.

### Evaluating Models

```python
import mlflow
import pandas as pd

df = pd.DataFrame(...)
eval_dataset = mlflow.data.from_pandas(df, predictions="outputs", targets="ground_truth")

with mlflow.start_run(run_name="evaluate_qa"):
    results = mlflow.evaluate(
        data=eval_dataset,
        model_type="question-answering",
    )

print(results.tables["eval_results_table"])
```

### Observability

```python
import mlflow
from openai import OpenAI

mlflow.openai.autolog()
response = OpenAI().chat.completions.create(...)
```

View traces in the MLflow UI under the "Traces" tab.
