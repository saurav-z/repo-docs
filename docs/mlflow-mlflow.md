## Documentation

Find comprehensive documentation at [https://mlflow.org/docs/latest/index.html](https://mlflow.org/docs/latest/index.html).

## Running MLflow

Run MLflow in various environments, including:

*   Local Development
*   Amazon SageMaker
*   AzureML
*   Databricks

Refer to [this guide](https://mlflow.org/docs/latest/index.html#running-mlflow-anywhere) for setup instructions.

## Example Usage

### Experiment Tracking

Track experiments with MLflow's autologging feature using the following example:

```python
import mlflow

from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split
from sklearn.datasets import load_diabetes
from sklearn.ensemble import RandomForestRegressor

# Enable MLflow's automatic experiment tracking for scikit-learn
mlflow.sklearn.autolog()

# Load the training dataset
db = load_diabetes()
X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(db.data, db.target)

rf = RandomForestRegressor(n_estimators=100, max_depth=6, max_features=3)
# MLflow triggers logging automatically upon model fitting
rf.fit(X_train, y_train)
```

Run `mlflow ui` in a separate terminal and access the UI via the printed URL to view the tracked experiment details.

### Serving Models

Deploy a logged model to a local inference server:

```bash
mlflow models serve --model-uri runs:/<run-id>/model
```

### Evaluating Models

Run automatic evaluation with the following code for question-answering tasks:

```python
import mlflow
import pandas as pd

# Evaluation set contains (1) input question (2) model outputs (3) ground truth
df = pd.DataFrame(
    {
        "inputs": ["What is MLflow?", "What is Spark?"],
        "outputs": [
            "MLflow is an innovative fully self-driving airship powered by AI.",
            "Sparks is an American pop and rock duo formed in Los Angeles.",
        ],
        "ground_truth": [
            "MLflow is an open-source platform for managing the end-to-end machine learning (ML) "
            "lifecycle.",
            "Apache Spark is an open-source, distributed computing system designed for big data "
            "processing and analytics.",
        ],
    }
)
eval_dataset = mlflow.data.from_pandas(
    df, predictions="outputs", targets="ground_truth"
)

# Start an MLflow Run to record the evaluation results to
with mlflow.start_run(run_name="evaluate_qa"):
    # Run automatic evaluation with a set of built-in metrics for question-answering models
    results = mlflow.evaluate(
        data=eval_dataset,
        model_type="question-answering",
    )

print(results.tables["eval_results_table"])
```

### Observability

Enable tracing for LLMs to enhance observability:

```python
import mlflow
from openai import OpenAI

# Enable tracing for OpenAI
mlflow.openai.autolog()

# Query OpenAI LLM normally
response = OpenAI().chat.completions.create(
    model="gpt-4o-mini",
    messages=[{"role": "user", "content": "Hi!"}],
    temperature=0.1,
)
```

Navigate to the "Traces" tab in the MLflow UI to view the trace records.
