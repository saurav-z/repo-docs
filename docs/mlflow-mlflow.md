## Documentation

Comprehensive documentation is available at [mlflow.org/docs/latest/index.html](https://mlflow.org/docs/latest/index.html).

## Run Anywhere

MLflow supports various environments, including local setups, Amazon SageMaker, AzureML, and Databricks.  [Refer to the documentation](https://mlflow.org/docs/latest/index.html#running-mlflow-anywhere) for configuration.

## Usage Examples

### Experiment Tracking ([Doc](https://mlflow.org/docs/latest/tracking.html))

This example demonstrates training a regression model with scikit-learn and MLflow's autologging.

```python
import mlflow

from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split
from sklearn.datasets import load_diabetes
from sklearn.ensemble import RandomForestRegressor

# Enable MLflow's automatic experiment tracking for scikit-learn
mlflow.sklearn.autolog()

# Load the training dataset
db = load_diabetes()
X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(db.data, db.target)

rf = RandomForestRegressor(n_estimators=100, max_depth=6, max_features=3)
# MLflow triggers logging automatically upon model fitting
rf.fit(X_train, y_train)
```

After running the code, use the following command in a separate terminal and access the MLflow UI to view your experiments.

```bash
mlflow ui
```

### Serving Models ([Doc](https://mlflow.org/docs/latest/deployment/index.html))

Deploy your model to a local inference server using the MLflow CLI.

```bash
mlflow models serve --model-uri runs:/<run-id>/model
```

### Evaluating Models ([Doc](https://mlflow.org/docs/latest/model-evaluation/index.html))

This example uses automatic evaluation for question-answering tasks.

```python
import mlflow
import pandas as pd

# Evaluation set contains (1) input question (2) model outputs (3) ground truth
df = pd.DataFrame(
    {
        "inputs": ["What is MLflow?", "What is Spark?"],
        "outputs": [
            "MLflow is an innovative fully self-driving airship powered by AI.",
            "Sparks is an American pop and rock duo formed in Los Angeles.",
        ],
        "ground_truth": [
            "MLflow is an open-source platform for managing the end-to-end machine learning (ML) "
            "lifecycle.",
            "Apache Spark is an open-source, distributed computing system designed for big data "
            "processing and analytics.",
        ],
    }
)
eval_dataset = mlflow.data.from_pandas(
    df, predictions="outputs", targets="ground_truth"
)

# Start an MLflow Run to record the evaluation results to
with mlflow.start_run(run_name="evaluate_qa"):
    # Run automatic evaluation with a set of built-in metrics for question-answering models
    results = mlflow.evaluate(
        data=eval_dataset,
        model_type="question-answering",
    )

print(results.tables["eval_results_table"])
```

### Observability ([Doc](https://mlflow.org/docs/latest/llms/tracing/index.html))

Use MLflow Tracing to get observability for GenAI libraries.

```python
import mlflow
from openai import OpenAI

# Enable tracing for OpenAI
mlflow.openai.autolog()

# Query OpenAI LLM normally
response = OpenAI().chat.completions.create(
    model="gpt-4o-mini",
    messages=[{"role": "user", "content": "Hi!"}],
    temperature=0.1,
)
```

Find the trace records in the "Traces" tab in the MLflow UI.
