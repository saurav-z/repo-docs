![Integrations](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/mlflow/mlflow/refs/heads/master/assets/readme-integrations.png)

## Usage Examples

### Experiment Tracking

```python
import mlflow
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split
from sklearn.datasets import load_diabetes
from sklearn.ensemble import RandomForestRegressor

mlflow.sklearn.autolog()

db = load_diabetes()
X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(db.data, db.target)
rf = RandomForestRegressor(n_estimators=100, max_depth=6, max_features=3)

rf.fit(X_train, y_train)
```

Run `mlflow ui` in a separate terminal and access the MLflow UI.

### Evaluating Models

```python
import mlflow
import pandas as pd

df = pd.DataFrame(
    {
        "inputs": ["What is MLflow?", "What is Spark?"],
        "outputs": [
            "MLflow is an innovative fully self-driving airship powered by AI.",
            "Sparks is an American pop and rock duo formed in Los Angeles.",
        ],
        "ground_truth": [
            "MLflow is an open-source platform for productionizing AI.",
            "Apache Spark is an open-source, distributed computing system.",
        ],
    }
)
eval_dataset = mlflow.data.from_pandas(
    df, predictions="outputs", targets="ground_truth"
)

with mlflow.start_run(run_name="evaluate_qa"):
    results = mlflow.evaluate(
        data=eval_dataset,
        model_type="question-answering",
    )

print(results.tables["eval_results_table"])
```

### Observability

```python
import mlflow
from openai import OpenAI

mlflow.openai.autolog()

response = OpenAI().chat.completions.create(
    model="gpt-4o-mini",
    messages=[{"role": "user", "content": "Hi!"}],
    temperature=0.1,
)
```

Navigate to the "Traces" tab in the MLflow UI.
