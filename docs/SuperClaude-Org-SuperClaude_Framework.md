## Installation

SuperClaude uses a two-step installation process:

### Step 1: Install the Package

**Recommended: Using `uv` or `uvx`:**
```bash
# Install uv (if you don't have it)
curl -Ls https://astral.sh/uv/install.sh | sh

# Install with uv
uv venv
source .venv/bin/activate
uv pip install SuperClaude

# OR use uvx directly if you prefer cross-platform CLI
uvx pip install SuperClaude
```

**Alternative: Using `pip`:**
```bash
pip install SuperClaude
```

### Step 2: Run the Installer
```bash
# Quick setup (recommended)
SuperClaude install

# Other options
SuperClaude install --interactive
SuperClaude install --minimal
SuperClaude install --profile developer
SuperClaude install --help # for more options
```

**Note:** Ensure you have Python 3.8+ installed.

## Upgrading from v2

Important steps when upgrading from v2:
1.  Uninstall v2 using its uninstaller.
2.  Manually delete these files/folders if they still exist: `SuperClaude/`, `~/.claude/shared/`, `~/.claude/commands/`, `~/.claude/CLAUDE.md`.
3.  Install v3 as described above.

**Key Change:** The `/build` command behavior has changed. `/sc:build` now handles compilation/packaging, while `/sc:implement` is for feature implementation.

## FAQ

**Q: Why was the hooks system removed?**

A: It was getting complex and buggy. We're redesigning it for v4.

**Q: Does this work with other AI assistants?**

A: Currently Claude Code only, but v4 will have broader compatibility.

**Q: Is this stable enough for daily use?**

A: The basic stuff works pretty well, but definitely expect some rough edges since it's a fresh release. Probably fine for experimenting! ðŸ§ª
