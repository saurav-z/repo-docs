## Upgrading from v2

If upgrading from SuperClaude v2, ensure you uninstall v2 and remove any residual files to avoid conflicts.

**Key Change for v2 Users**: The `/build` command has changed. In v3, use `/sc:implement` for feature implementation and `/sc:build` for compilation/packaging.

## Installation

### Step 1: Install the Package

Choose your preferred method:

**Option A: From PyPI (Recommended)**

```bash
uv add SuperClaude
```

**Option B: From Source**

```bash
git clone https://github.com/SuperClaude-Org/SuperClaude_Framework.git
cd SuperClaude_Framework
uv sync
```

### üîß UV / UVX Setup Guide

SuperClaude v3 also supports installation via [`uv`](https://github.com/astral-sh/uv) (a faster, modern Python package manager) or `uvx` for cross-platform usage.

### üåÄ Install with `uv`

Make sure `uv` is installed:

```bash
curl -Ls https://astral.sh/uv/install.sh | sh
```

> Or follow instructions from: [https://github.com/astral-sh/uv](https://github.com/astral-sh/uv)

Once `uv` is available, you can install SuperClaude like this:

```bash
uv venv
source .venv/bin/activate
uv pip install SuperClaude
```

### ‚ö° Install with `uvx` (Cross-platform CLI)

If you‚Äôre using `uvx`, just run:

```bash
uvx pip install SuperClaude
```

### ‚úÖ Finish Installation

After installing, continue with the usual installer step:

```bash
python3 -m SuperClaude install
```

Or using bash-style CLI:

```bash
SuperClaude install
```

### üß† Note:

*   `uv` provides better caching and performance.
*   Compatible with Python 3.8+ and works smoothly with SuperClaude.

**Missing Python?** Install Python 3.7+ first:

```bash
# Linux (Ubuntu/Debian)
sudo apt update && sudo apt install python3 python3-pip

# macOS
brew install python3

# Windows
# Download from https://python.org/downloads/
```

### Step 2: Run the Installer

After installing the package, run the SuperClaude installer to configure Claude Code (You can use any of the method):

### ‚ö†Ô∏è Important Note

**After installing the SuperClaude.**

**You can use `SuperClaude commands`, `python3 -m SuperClaude commands` or also `python3 SuperClaude commands`**

```bash
# Quick setup (recommended for most users)
python3 SuperClaude install

# Interactive selection (choose components)
python3 SuperClaude install --interactive

# Minimal install (just core framework)
python3 SuperClaude install --minimal

# Developer setup (everything included)
python3 SuperClaude install --profile developer

# See all available options
python3 SuperClaude install --help
```

### Or Python Modular Usage

```bash
# Quick setup (recommended for most users)
python3 -m SuperClaude install

# Interactive selection (choose components)
python3 -m SuperClaude install --interactive

# Minimal install (just core framework)
python3 -m SuperClaude install --minimal

# Developer setup (everything included)
python3 -m SuperClaude install --profile developer

# See all available options
python3 -m SuperClaude install --help
```

### Simple bash Command Usage

```bash
# Quick setup (recommended for most users)
SuperClaude install

# Interactive selection (choose components)
SuperClaude install --interactive

# Minimal install (just core framework)
SuperClaude install --minimal

# Developer setup (everything included)
SuperClaude install --profile developer

# See all available options
SuperClaude install --help
```

**That's it! üéâ** The installer handles framework files, MCP servers, and Claude Code configuration.

## How It Works
