### Docker Deployment

Docker deployment provides a WebUI management interface for configuration, satisfying most needs graphically.

**Deployment Command:**

```shell
docker run -d \
  --name quark-auto-save \
  -p 5005:5005 \ # Adjust the port before the colon if needed (e.g., 8080:5005); the one after must remain unchanged.
  -e WEBUI_USERNAME=admin \
  -e WEBUI_PASSWORD=admin123 \
  -v ./quark-auto-save/config:/app/config \ # Required, for persistent configuration
  -v ./quark-auto-save/media:/media \ # Optional, for module alist_strm_gen to generate strm files
  --network bridge \
  --restart unless-stopped \
  cp0204/quark-auto-save:latest
  # registry.cn-shenzhen.aliyuncs.com/cp0204/quark-auto-save:latest # Domestic mirror address
```

**docker-compose.yml**

```yaml
name: quark-auto-save
services:
  quark-auto-save:
    image: cp0204/quark-auto-save:latest
    container_name: quark-auto-save
    network_mode: bridge
    ports:
      - 5005:5005
    restart: unless-stopped

> [!TIP]
>
> **Magic Matching and Magic Variables**: In regular expression processing, we've defined some "magic match" patterns. If the value of an expression starts with `$`, and the replace field is left empty, the program will automatically use a predefined regular expression for matching and replacement.
>
> From v0.6.0 onwards, more "magic variables" enclosed in {} are supported for more flexible renaming.

### Refreshing Your Media Library

Upon new saves, trigger actions like automatically refreshing your media library or generating `.strm` files. Configuration guide: [Plugin Configuration](https://github.com/Cp0204/quark-auto-save/wiki/Plugin-Configuration)

Media library modules are integrated as plugins. If you're interested, refer to the [Plugin Development Guide](https://github.com/Cp0204/quark-auto-save/tree/main/plugins).
