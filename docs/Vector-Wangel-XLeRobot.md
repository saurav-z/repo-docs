## 🚀 Getting Started

Follow these steps to build your own XLeRobot:

> [!NOTE]
> If you are totally new to programming, please spend at least a day to get yourself familiar with basic Python, Ubuntu and Github (with the help of Google and AI). At least you should know how to set up ubuntu system, git clone, pip install, use intepreters (VS Code, Cursor, Pycharm, etc.) and directly run commands in the terminals.

1.  💵 **Buy Your Parts:** See the [Bill of Materials](https://xlerobot.readthedocs.io/en/latest/hardware/getting_started/material.html).
2.  🖨️ **3D Print:**  Get your components printed, following the [3D printing guide](https://xlerobot.readthedocs.io/en/latest/hardware/getting_started/3d.html).
3.  🔨 **Assemble:**  Put your robot together using the [assembly instructions](https://xlerobot.readthedocs.io/en/latest/hardware/getting_started/assemble.html).
4.  💻 **Software:**  Get your robot moving with the [software setup guide](https://xlerobot.readthedocs.io/en/latest/software/index.html).
