## About the Creator

[Gaotian/Vector Wang](https://vector-wangel.github.io/)

I am a CS graduate student at Rice University [RobotPi Lab](https://robotpilab.github.io/), focusing on robust object manipulation. I built XLeRobot as a personal hobby to instantiate my research theory and provide a low-cost platform for those interested in robotics and embodied AI.
