## Marqo: The Open-Source Vector Search Engine for Text and Images

**Marqo simplifies building cutting-edge search applications by providing an end-to-end vector search solution for both text and images, all through a single API.** This means you can build powerful search applications with minimal effort.  Dive into the [original repo](https://github.com/marqo-ai/marqo) for more details.

**Key Features:**

*   ü§ñ **State-of-the-art Embeddings:** Utilize the latest machine learning models from Hugging Face, OpenAI, and more with both CPU and GPU support.
*   ‚ö° **High Performance:** Experience blazing-fast search speeds with in-memory HNSW indexes, scaling to hundreds of millions of documents. Benefit from async and non-blocking data upload and search.
*   üåå **Documents-In-Documents-Out:**  Simplify your workflow with out-of-the-box vector generation, storage, and retrieval for text and images.
*   üç± **Managed Cloud Option:** Leverage a fully managed cloud service with low-latency deployments, scalable inference, high availability, and 24/7 support (learn more at [Marqo Cloud](https://www.marqo.ai/cloud)).
*   üñºÔ∏è **Multimodal Search:** Seamlessly search across text and images.
*   ‚úÖ **Flexible Indexing:** Supports various datatypes and complex semantic queries with weighted search terms and filtering options.
*   üîå **Easy Integrations:** Out-of-the-box integrations with popular frameworks like Haystack, Griptape, Langchain, and Hamilton.

## Getting Started Quickly

Get your search application up and running in minutes with Marqo!

1.  **Install Docker:** [Docker Official website](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/). Ensure at least 8GB memory and 50GB storage is allocated.
2.  **Run Marqo using Docker:**

    ```bash
    docker rm -f marqo
    docker pull marqoai/marqo:latest
    docker run --name marqo -it -p 8882:8882 marqoai/marqo:latest
    ```

3.  **Install the Marqo client:**

    ```bash
    pip install marqo
    ```

4.  **Start indexing and searching!**

    ```python
    import marqo

    mq = marqo.Client(url='http://localhost:8882')

    mq.create_index("my-first-index", model="hf/e5-base-v2")

    mq.index("my-first-index").add_documents([
        {
            "Title": "The Travels of Marco Polo",
            "Description": "A 13th-century travelogue describing Polo's travels"
        },
        {
            "Title": "Extravehicular Mobility Unit (EMU)",
            "Description": "The EMU is a spacesuit that provides environmental protection, "
                           "mobility, life support, and communications for astronauts",
            "_id": "article_591"
        }],
        tensor_fields=["Description"]
    )

    results = mq.index("my-first-index").search(
        q="What is the best outfit to wear on the moon?"
    )
    ```

## Core Functionality and Operations

Here's a breakdown of essential operations:

*   **`mq = marqo.Client(url='http://localhost:8882')`**:  Establishes a connection to your Marqo instance.
*   **`create_index()`**:  Creates a new index with specified settings, including the option to select a model (e.g., `model="hf/e5-base-v2"`).  Experiment with different models for optimal results.  See the [model reference](https://docs.marqo.ai/1.0.0/Models-Reference/dense_retrieval/) for a full list.
*   **`add_documents()`**: Indexes your data (documents) with the specified `tensor_fields` for vector search.
*   **`search()`**: Performs semantic searches based on your query.
*   **Get document**: Retrieve a document by ID.
    ```python
    result = mq.index("my-first-index").get_document(document_id="article_591")
    ```

*   **Get index stats**: Get information about an index.
    ```python
    results = mq.index("my-first-index").get_stats()
    ```

*   **Lexical search**: Perform a keyword search.

    ```python
    result = mq.index("my-first-index").search('marco polo', search_method=marqo.SearchMethods.LEXICAL)
    ```

*   **Multi modal and cross modal search**: To power image and text search, Marqo allows users to plug and play with CLIP models from HuggingFace.  Create an index with a CLIP configuration.
    ```python
    settings = {
        "treat_urls_and_pointers_as_images":True,   # allows us to find an image file and index it
        "model":"ViT-L/14"
    }
    response = mq.create_index("my-multimodal-index", **settings)
    ```

    Images can then be added within documents as follows. You can use urls from the internet (for example S3) or from the disk of the machine:

    ```python
    response = mq.index("my-multimodal-index").add_documents([{
        "My_Image": "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/marqo-ai/marqo-api-tests/mainline/assets/ai_hippo_realistic.png",
        "Description": "The hippopotamus, also called the common hippopotamus or river hippopotamus, is a large semiaquatic mammal native to sub-Saharan Africa",
        "_id": "hippo-facts"
    }], tensor_fields=["My_Image"])
    ```

    You can then search the image field using text.

    ```python
    results = mq.index("my-multimodal-index").search('animal')
    ```

*   **Searching using an image**
    Searching using an image can be achieved by providing the image link.

    ```python
    results = mq.index("my-multimodal-index").search('https://raw.githubusercontent.com/marqo-ai/marqo-api-tests/mainline/assets/ai_hippo_statue.png')
    ```

*   **Searching using weights in queries**
    Queries can also be provided as dictionaries where each key is a query and their corresponding values are weights. This allows for more advanced queries consisting of multiple components with weightings towards or against them, queries can have negations via negative weighting.

    ```python
    import marqo
    import pprint

    mq = marqo.Client(url="http://localhost:8882")

    mq.create_index("my-weighted-query-index")

    mq.index("my-weighted-query-index").add_documents(
        [
            {
                "Title": "Smartphone",
                "Description": "A smartphone is a portable computer device that combines mobile telephone "
                "functions and computing functions into one unit.",
            },
            {
                "Title": "Telephone",
                "Description": "A telephone is a telecommunications device that permits two or more users to"
                "conduct a conversation when they are too far apart to be easily heard directly.",
            },
            {
                "Title": "Thylacine",
                "Description": "The thylacine, also commonly known as the Tasmanian tiger or Tasmanian wolf, "
                "is an extinct carnivorous marsupial."
                "The last known of its species died in 1936.",
            }
        ],
        tensor_fields=["Description"]
    )

    # initially we ask for a type of communications device which is popular in the 21st century
    query = {
        # a weighting of 1.1 gives this query slightly more importance
        "I need to buy a communications device, what should I get?": 1.1,
        # a weighting of 1 gives this query a neutral importance
        # this will lead to 'Smartphone' being the top result
        "The device should work like an intelligent computer.": 1.0,
    }

    results = mq.index("my-weighted-query-index").search(q=query)

    print("Query 1:")
    pprint.pprint(results)

    # now we ask for a type of communications which predates the 21st century
    query = {
        # a weighting of 1 gives this query a neutral importance
        "I need to buy a communications device, what should I get?": 1.0,
        # a weighting of -1 gives this query a negation effect
        # this will lead to 'Telephone' being the top result
        "The device should work like an intelligent computer.": -0.3,
    }

    results = mq.index("my-weighted-query-index").search(q=query)

    print("\nQuery 2:")
    pprint.pprint(results)
    ```

*   **Creating and searching indexes with multimodal combination fields**
    ```python
    import marqo

    settings = {"treat_urls_and_pointers_as_images": True, "model": "ViT-L/14"}
