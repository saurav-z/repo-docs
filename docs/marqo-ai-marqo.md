## Quick Start

Get started with Marqo in a few simple steps:

1.  **Install Docker:**  Marqo requires Docker. Download it from the [Docker Official website](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/). Ensure Docker has at least 8GB of memory and 50GB of storage (recommended).
2.  **Run Marqo with Docker:**

    ```bash
    docker rm -f marqo
    docker pull marqoai/marqo:latest
    docker run --name marqo -it -p 8882:8882 marqoai/marqo:latest
    ```
3.  **Install the Marqo Client:**

    ```bash
    pip install marqo
    ```
4.  **Index and Search!**

    ```python
    import marqo

    mq = marqo.Client(url='http://localhost:8882')

    mq.create_index("my-first-index", model="hf/e5-base-v2")

    mq.index("my-first-index").add_documents([
        {
            "Title": "The Travels of Marco Polo",
            "Description": "A 13th-century travelogue describing Polo's travels"
        },
        {
            "Title": "Extravehicular Mobility Unit (EMU)",
            "Description": "The EMU is a spacesuit that provides environmental protection, "
                           "mobility, life support, and communications for astronauts",
            "_id": "article_591"
        }],
        tensor_fields=["Description"]
    )

    results = mq.index("my-first-index").search(
        q="What is the best outfit to wear on the moon?"
    )
    ```

## Core Features Deep Dive

## Getting Started (Detailed)

1.  **Docker Setup:**  Install Docker from the [Docker Official website](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/). Ensure Docker has at least 8GB of memory and 50GB storage.
2.  **Run Marqo:**

    ```bash
    docker rm -f marqo
    docker pull marqoai/marqo:latest
    docker run --name marqo -p 8882:8882 marqoai/marqo:latest
    ```
    *Note: If your `marqo` container gets killed, increase Docker memory to at least 6GB (8GB recommended).*
3.  **Install Client:**

    ```bash
    pip install marqo
    ```
4.  **Example Usage:**

    ```python
    import marqo

    mq = marqo.Client(url='http://localhost:8882')

    mq.create_index("my-first-index") # Optionally specify a model:  model="hf/e5-base-v2"

    mq.index("my-first-index").add_documents([
        {
            "Title": "The Travels of Marco Polo",
            "Description": "A 13th-century travelogue describing Polo's travels"
        },
        {
            "Title": "Extravehicular Mobility Unit (EMU)",
            "Description": "The EMU is a spacesuit that provides environmental protection, "
                           "mobility, life support, and communications for astronauts",
            "_id": "article_591"
        }],
        tensor_fields=["Description"]
    )

    results = mq.index("my-first-index").search(
        q="What is the best outfit to wear on the moon?"
    )
    ```
    *   `mq`:  The Marqo client.
    *   `create_index()`: Creates an index.  You can specify a model.  Experiment to find the best model for your data.
    *   `add_documents()`: Add documents to the index. `tensor_fields` specifies the fields to be indexed as vectors.
    *   `_id`:  Optional document ID. Marqo generates one if not provided.
    *   Each hit in results contains the `_highlights` field showing what matched the search query.

## Basic Operations

*   **Get Document:** Retrieve a document by its ID:
    ```python
    result = mq.index("my-first-index").get_document(document_id="article_591")
    ```
*   **Get Index Stats:** Get index information:
    ```python
    results = mq.index("my-first-index").get_stats()
    ```
*   **Lexical Search:** Perform keyword search:
    ```python
    result = mq.index("my-first-index").search('marco polo', search_method=marqo.SearchMethods.LEXICAL)
    ```
*   **Multimodal Search:** Enable image and text search with CLIP models.
    ```python
    settings = {
        "treat_urls_and_pointers_as_images": True,
        "model": "ViT-L/14"
    }
    response = mq.create_index("my-multimodal-index", **settings)

    response = mq.index("my-multimodal-index").add_documents([{
        "My_Image": "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/marqo-ai/marqo-api-tests/mainline/assets/ai_hippo_realistic.png",
        "Description": "The hippopotamus...",
        "_id": "hippo-facts"
    }], tensor_fields=["My_Image"])

    results = mq.index("my-multimodal-index").search('animal')
    ```
*   **Search Using an Image:**
    ```python
    results = mq.index("my-multimodal-index").search('https://raw.githubusercontent.com/marqo-ai/marqo-api-tests/mainline/assets/ai_hippo_statue.png')
    ```
*   **Weighted Queries:** Construct more complex queries by assigning weights.
    ```python
    query = {
        "I need to buy a communications device, what should I get?": 1.1,
        "The device should work like an intelligent computer.": 1.0,
    }
    results = mq.index("my-weighted-query-index").search(q=query)
    ```
*   **Multimodal Combination Fields:** Combine text and images in one field for document scoring and search.

    ```python
    #  Example shows retrieval of caption and image pairs using multiple types of queries.
    # Create the mappings, here we define our captioned_image mapping
    # which weights the image more heavily than the caption - these pairs
    # will be represented by a single vector in the index
    mappings={
        "captioned_image": {
            "type": "multimodal_combination",
            "weights": {
                "caption": 0.3,
                "image": 0.7
            }
        }
    }
    # We specify which fields to create vectors for.
    # Note that captioned_image is treated as a single field.
    tensor_fields=["captioned_image"]
    ```
*   **Delete Documents:**
    ```python
    results = mq.index("my-first-index").delete_documents(ids=["article_591", "article_602"])
    ```
*   **Delete Index:**
    ```python
    results = mq.index("my-first-index").delete()
    ```
