## Marqo: The Open-Source, End-to-End Vector Search Engine for Text and Images

Marqo simplifies vector search by handling vector generation, storage, and retrieval with a single API, making it easy to build powerful search applications.  [See the original repo](https://github.com/marqo-ai/marqo).

**Key Features:**

*   **State-of-the-Art Embeddings:** Utilize the latest machine learning models from PyTorch, Hugging Face, OpenAI, and more, with both CPU and GPU support.
*   **High Performance:** Experience cutting-edge search speeds with embeddings stored in in-memory HNSW indexes, and scale to handle hundreds of millions of documents with horizontal index sharding.
*   **Documents-In, Documents-Out:** Build applications using text and images with out-of-the-box vector generation, storage, and retrieval, easily building search, entity resolution, and data exploration applications.
*   **Multimodal Search:** Seamlessly search both text and images, including support for cross-modal search.
*   **Flexibility and Control:** Choose from pre-configured models or bring your own, and customize search behavior.
*   **Managed Cloud Option:**  Deploy and scale with ease with Marqo Cloud, offering low-latency deployment, scalability, high availability, and 24/7 support.

## Why Choose Marqo?

Marqo goes beyond a standard vector database by integrating machine learning model management and input preprocessing, enabling developers to build sophisticated search capabilities with minimal effort. It simplifies the complexities of vector search, offering a streamlined "documents in, documents out" approach.

## Getting Started

1.  **Docker:** Install Docker from the [Docker Official website](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/).  Ensure Docker has at least 8GB memory and 50GB storage.
2.  **Run Marqo with Docker:**
    ```bash
    docker rm -f marqo
    docker pull marqoai/marqo:latest
    docker run --name marqo -it -p 8882:8882 marqoai/marqo:latest
    ```
3.  **Install the Marqo Client:**
    ```bash
    pip install marqo
    ```
4.  **Example Code:**

    ```python
    import marqo

    mq = marqo.Client(url='http://localhost:8882')

    mq.create_index("my-first-index", model="hf/e5-base-v2")

    mq.index("my-first-index").add_documents([
        {
            "Title": "The Travels of Marco Polo",
            "Description": "A 13th-century travelogue describing Polo's travels"
        }, 
        {
            "Title": "Extravehicular Mobility Unit (EMU)",
            "Description": "The EMU is a spacesuit that provides environmental protection, "
                           "mobility, life support, and communications for astronauts",
            "_id": "article_591"
        }],
        tensor_fields=["Description"]
    )

    results = mq.index("my-first-index").search(
        q="What is the best outfit to wear on the moon?"
    )
    ```

## Running Marqo in Production

Marqo offers Kubernetes templates for deployment on your chosen cloud provider, supporting clusters with replicas, storage shards, and inference nodes ([https://github.com/marqo-ai/marqo-on-kubernetes](https://github.com/marqo-ai/marqo-on-kubernetes)).  For a fully managed solution, explore Marqo Cloud: [https://cloud.marqo.ai](https://cloud.marqo.ai).

## Documentation

Comprehensive documentation is available at [https://docs.marqo.ai/](https://docs.marqo.ai/).

## Important Notes
