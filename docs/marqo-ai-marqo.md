### Getting Started

Follow these steps to quickly set up and run Marqo:

1.  **Install Docker:** Go to the [Docker Official website](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/) and install Docker. Ensure that Docker is allocated at least 8GB of memory and 50GB of storage.
2.  **Run Marqo with Docker:**
    ```bash
    docker rm -f marqo
    docker pull marqoai/marqo:latest
    docker run --name marqo -p 8882:8882 marqoai/marqo:latest
    ```
    *Note: If the `marqo` container is being killed due to a lack of memory, increase the memory limit in Docker settings to at least 6GB (8GB is recommended).*
3.  **Install the Marqo client:**
    ```bash
    pip install marqo
    ```
4.  **Start Indexing and Searching!** Below is a simple example:
    ```python
    import marqo

    mq = marqo.Client(url='http://localhost:8882')

    mq.create_index("my-first-index", model="hf/e5-base-v2")

    mq.index("my-first-index").add_documents([
        {
            "Title": "The Travels of Marco Polo",
            "Description": "A 13th-century travelogue describing Polo's travels"
        },
        {
            "Title": "Extravehicular Mobility Unit (EMU)",
            "Description": "The EMU is a spacesuit that provides environmental protection, "
                           "mobility, life support, and communications for astronauts",
            "_id": "article_591"
        }],
        tensor_fields=["Description"]
    )

    results = mq.index("my-first-index").search(
        q="What is the best outfit to wear on the moon?"
    )
    ```
    *   `mq` is the client, wrapping the `marqo` API.
    *   `create_index()` creates a new index, where you can specify the model to use (e.g., `hf/e5-base-v2`).
    *   `add_documents()` indexes documents from a list of Python dictionaries, where `tensor_fields` indicate the fields that will be indexed as vector collections.
    *   You can set a document's ID with the `_id` field. Otherwise, Marqo generates one.
5.  **View Results:**
    ```python
    # Print the results:
    import pprint
    pprint.pprint(results)
    ```
    *   Each hit is a matched document, ordered by relevance.
    *   `_highlights` highlights the matching section of the document.
    *   `_score` reflects the match relevance.

### Other Basic Operations

*   **Get Document:** Retrieve a document by its ID.
    ```python
    result = mq.index("my-first-index").get_document(document_id="article_591")
    ```
*   **Get Index Stats:** Retrieve index information.
    ```python
    results = mq.index("my-first-index").get_stats()
    ```
*   **Lexical Search:** Perform keyword searches.
    ```python
    result = mq.index("my-first-index").search('marco polo', search_method=marqo.SearchMethods.LEXICAL)
    ```
*   **Multi-Modal and Cross-Modal Search:**  Use CLIP models from Hugging Face to enable image and text search.  Create an index with a CLIP configuration:
    ```python
    settings = {
        "treat_urls_and_pointers_as_images":True,
        "model":"ViT-L/14"
    }
    response = mq.create_index("my-multimodal-index", **settings)
    ```
    Add images within documents using URLs or local paths:
    ```python
    response = mq.index("my-multimodal-index").add_documents([{
        "My_Image": "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/marqo-ai/marqo-api-tests/mainline/assets/ai_hippo_realistic.png",
        "Description": "The hippopotamus...",
        "_id": "hippo-facts"
    }], tensor_fields=["My_Image"])
    ```
    Then, search the image field using text:
    ```python
    results = mq.index("my-multimodal-index").search('animal')
    ```
    or search using an image itself:
    ```python
    results = mq.index("my-multimodal-index").search('https://raw.githubusercontent.com/marqo-ai/marqo-api-tests/mainline/assets/ai_hippo_statue.png')
    ```
*   **Weighted Queries:** Construct advanced queries with weighted components:
    ```python
    query = {
        "I need to buy a communications device, what should I get?": 1.1,
        "The device should work like an intelligent computer.": 1.0,
    }
    results = mq.index("my-weighted-query-index").search(q=query)
    ```
*   **Multimodal Combination Fields:** Combine text and images within a single field, with per-document weighting:
    ```python
    mappings={
        "captioned_image": {
            "type": "multimodal_combination",
            "weights": {
                "caption": 0.3,
                "image": 0.7
            }
        }
    },
    tensor_fields=["captioned_image"]
    ```
*   **Delete Documents:** Delete documents by ID.
    ```python
    results = mq.index("my-first-index").delete_documents(ids=["article_591", "article_602"])
    ```
*   **Delete Index:** Delete an index.
    ```python
    results = mq.index("my-first-index").delete()
    ```

### Production Deployment

*   **Kubernetes:**  Marqo provides Kubernetes templates for deploying clusters, including replicas, storage sharding, and inference nodes.  Find the repo here:  [https://github.com/marqo-ai/marqo-on-kubernetes](https://github.com/marqo-ai/marqo-on-kubernetes)
