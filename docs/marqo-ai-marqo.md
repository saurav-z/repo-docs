## Marqo: The Open-Source Vector Search Engine for Text and Images

Marqo is an open-source, end-to-end vector search engine that simplifies building search, entity resolution, and data exploration applications for text and images.  [Explore Marqo on GitHub](https://github.com/marqo-ai/marqo).

**Key Features:**

*   **üöÄ Cutting-Edge Embeddings:** Leverages the latest machine learning models from PyTorch, Hugging Face, OpenAI, and more; supports both CPU and GPU.
*   **‚ö° Blazing Fast Performance:** Utilizes in-memory HNSW indexes for rapid search speeds and scales to millions of documents with horizontal index sharding.
*   **üì¶ Documents-in, Documents-out:** Simplifies vector generation, storage, and retrieval for text and images, allowing you to build complex semantic queries with ease.
*   **‚ú® Multimodal Search:**  Seamlessly integrate and search across text and images using CLIP models.
*   **‚òÅÔ∏è Managed Cloud Option:** Provides a low-latency, optimized deployment of Marqo, with scalable inference, high availability, and 24/7 support.

**Why Choose Marqo?**

Marqo goes beyond a basic vector database by providing a complete solution for vector search.  It handles machine learning model management, preprocessing, and input transformations, enabling developers to quickly integrate powerful search capabilities with minimal effort.  Marqo supports many data types, and also lets you combine unstructured data and metadata in the same documents for complex search queries.

**Quick Start**

Get started with Marqo in just a few steps:

1.  **Install Docker:**  Follow the [Docker Official website](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/) instructions to install Docker. Ensure Docker has at least 8GB memory and 50GB storage.
2.  **Run Marqo with Docker:**
    ```bash
    docker rm -f marqo
    docker pull marqoai/marqo:latest
    docker run --name marqo -it -p 8882:8882 marqoai/marqo:latest
    ```
3.  **Install the Marqo Client:**
    ```bash
    pip install marqo
    ```
4.  **Start Indexing and Searching:**  See the example code in the original README.

**Integrations**

Marqo integrates with popular AI and data processing frameworks, including:

*   [Haystack](https://github.com/deepset-ai/haystack)
*   [Griptape](https://github.com/griptape-ai/griptape)
*   [Langchain](https://github.com/langchain-ai/langchain)
