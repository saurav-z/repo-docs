## Getting Started

1.  **Install Docker:** [Docker Official Website](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/) (Ensure at least 8GB memory and 50GB storage in Docker settings).
2.  **Run Marqo with Docker:**
    ```bash
    docker rm -f marqo
    docker pull marqoai/marqo:latest
    docker run --name marqo -p 8882:8882 marqoai/marqo:latest
    ```
3.  **Install the Marqo Client:**
    ```bash
    pip install marqo
    ```
4.  **Start Indexing and Searching:**

    ```python
    import marqo

    mq = marqo.Client(url='http://localhost:8882')
    mq.create_index("my-first-index", model="hf/e5-base-v2") # Example of specifying a model
    mq.index("my-first-index").add_documents([
        {
            "Title": "The Travels of Marco Polo",
            "Description": "A 13th-century travelogue describing Polo's travels"
        }, 
        {
            "Title": "Extravehicular Mobility Unit (EMU)",
            "Description": "The EMU is a spacesuit that provides environmental protection, "
                           "mobility, life support, and communications for astronauts",
            "_id": "article_591"
        }],
        tensor_fields=["Description"]
    )
    results = mq.index("my-first-index").search(
        q="What is the best outfit to wear on the moon?"
    )
    ```
    *  `mq` is the client that wraps the `marqo` API.
    *  `create_index()` creates a new index with default settings. You have the option to specify what model to use. For example, `mq.create_index("my-first-index", model="hf/e5-base-v2")` will create an index with the default text model `hf/e5-base-v2`. Experimentation with different models is often required to achieve the best retrieval for your specific use case. Different models also offer a tradeoff between inference speed and relevancy. See [here](https://docs.marqo.ai/1.0.0/Models-Reference/dense_retrieval/) for the full list of models.
    *  `add_documents()` takes a list of documents, represented as python dicts for indexing. `tensor_fields` refers to the fields that will be indexed as vector collections and made searchable.
    *  You can optionally set a document's ID with the special `_id` field. Otherwise, Marqo will generate one.
    ```python
    # let's print out the results:
    import pprint
    pprint.pprint(results)

    {
        'hits': [
            {
                'Title': 'Extravehicular Mobility Unit (EMU)',
                'Description': 'The EMU is a spacesuit that provides environmental protection, mobility, life support, and'
                               'communications for astronauts',
                '_highlights': [{
                    'Description': 'The EMU is a spacesuit that provides environmental protection, '
                                   'mobility, life support, and communications for astronauts'
                }],
                '_id': 'article_591',
                '_score': 0.61938936
            },
            {
                'Title': 'The Travels of Marco Polo',
                'Description': "A 13th-century travelogue describing Polo's travels",
                '_highlights': [{'Title': 'The Travels of Marco Polo'}],
                '_id': 'e00d1a8d-894c-41a1-8e3b-d8b2a8fce12a',
                '_score': 0.60237324
            }
        ],
        'limit': 10,
        'processingTimeMs': 49,
        'query': 'What is the best outfit to wear on the moon?'
    }
    ```

    *   Each hit corresponds to a document that matched the search query.
    *   They are ordered from most to least matching.
    *   `limit` is the maximum number of hits to be returned. This can be set as a parameter during search.
    *   Each hit has a `_highlights` field. This was the part of the document that matched the query the best.

## Further Operations and Features

### Get Document
Retrieve a document by ID.

```python
result = mq.index("my-first-index").get_document(document_id="article_591")
```
Note that by adding the document using ```add_documents``` again using the same ```_id``` will cause a document to be updated.

### Get Index Stats
Get information about an index.

```python
results = mq.index("my-first-index").get_stats()
```

### Lexical Search
Perform a keyword search.

```python
result = mq.index("my-first-index").search('marco polo', search_method=marqo.SearchMethods.LEXICAL)
```

### Multi Modal and Cross Modal Search
To power image and text search, Marqo allows users to plug and play with CLIP models from HuggingFace. **Note that if you do not configure multi modal search, image urls will be treated as strings.** To start indexing and searching with images, first create an index with a CLIP configuration, as below:

```python
settings = {
    "treat_urls_and_pointers_as_images":True,   # allows us to find an image file and index it 
    "model":"ViT-L/14"
}
response = mq.create_index("my-multimodal-index", **settings)
```

Images can then be added within documents as follows. You can use urls from the internet (for example S3) or from the disk of the machine:

```python
response = mq.index("my-multimodal-index").add_documents([{
    "My_Image": "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/marqo-ai/marqo-api-tests/mainline/assets/ai_hippo_realistic.png",
    "Description": "The hippopotamus, also called the common hippopotamus or river hippopotamus, is a large semiaquatic mammal native to sub-Saharan Africa",
    "_id": "hippo-facts"
}], tensor_fields=["My_Image"])
```

You can then search the image field using text.

```python
results = mq.index("my-multimodal-index").search('animal')
```

### Searching using an image
Searching using an image can be achieved by providing the image link.

```python
results = mq.index("my-multimodal-index").search('https://raw.githubusercontent.com/marqo-ai/marqo-api-tests/mainline/assets/ai_hippo_statue.png')
```

### Searching using weights in queries
Queries can also be provided as dictionaries where each key is a query and their corresponding values are weights. This allows for more advanced queries consisting of multiple components with weightings towards or against them, queries can have negations via negative weighting.

The example below shows the application of this to a scenario where a user may want to ask a question but also negate results that match a certain semantic criterion. 

```python
import marqo
import pprint

mq = marqo.Client(url="http://localhost:8882")

mq.create_index("my-weighted-query-index")

mq.index("my-weighted-query-index").add_documents(
    [
        {
            "Title": "Smartphone",
            "Description": "A smartphone is a portable computer device that combines mobile telephone "
            "functions and computing functions into one unit.",
        },
        {
            "Title": "Telephone",
            "Description": "A telephone is a telecommunications device that permits two or more users to"
            "conduct a conversation when they are too far apart to be easily heard directly.",
        },
        {
            "Title": "Thylacine",
            "Description": "The thylacine, also commonly known as the Tasmanian tiger or Tasmanian wolf, "
            "is an extinct carnivorous marsupial."
            "The last known of its species died in 1936.",
        }
    ],
    tensor_fields=["Description"]
)

# initially we ask for a type of communications device which is popular in the 21st century
query = {
    # a weighting of 1.1 gives this query slightly more importance
    "I need to buy a communications device, what should I get?": 1.1,
    # a weighting of 1 gives this query a neutral importance
    # this will lead to 'Smartphone' being the top result
    "The device should work like an intelligent computer.": 1.0,
}

results = mq.index("my-weighted-query-index").search(q=query)

print("Query 1:")
pprint.pprint(results)

# now we ask for a type of communications which predates the 21st century
query = {
    # a weighting of 1 gives this query a neutral importance
    "I need to buy a communications device, what should I get?": 1.0,
    # a weighting of -1 gives this query a negation effect
    # this will lead to 'Telephone' being the top result
    "The device should work like an intelligent computer.": -0.3,
}

results = mq.index("my-weighted-query-index").search(q=query)

print("\nQuery 2:")
pprint.pprint(results)
```

### Creating and searching indexes with multimodal combination fields
Marqo lets you have indexes with multimodal combination fields. Multimodal combination fields can combine text and images into one field. This allows scoring of documents across the combined text and image fields together. It also allows for a single vector representation instead of needing many which saves on storage. The relative weighting of each component can be set per document.

The example below demonstrates this with retrieval of caption and image pairs using multiple types of queries.

```python
import marqo
import pprint

mq = marqo.Client(url="http://localhost:8882")

settings = {"treat_urls_and_pointers_as_images": True, "model": "ViT-L/14"}

mq.create_index("my-first-multimodal-index", **settings)

mq.index("my-first-multimodal-index").add_documents(
    [
        {
            "Title": "Flying Plane",
            "caption": "An image of a passenger plane flying in front of the moon.",
            "image": "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/marqo-ai/marqo/mainline/examples/ImageSearchGuide/data/image2.jpg",
        },
        {
            "Title": "Red Bus",
            "caption": "A red double decker London bus traveling to Aldwych",
            "image": "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/marqo-ai/marqo/mainline/examples/ImageSearchGuide/data/image4.jpg",
        },
        {
            "Title": "Horse Jumping",
            "caption": "A person riding a horse over a jump in a competition.",
            "image": "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/marqo-ai/marqo/mainline/examples/ImageSearchGuide/data/image1.jpg",
        },
    ],
    # Create the mappings, here we define our captioned_image mapping 
    # which weights the image more heavily than the caption - these pairs 
    # will be represented by a single vector in the index
    mappings={
        "captioned_image": {
            "type": "multimodal_combination",
            "weights": {
                "caption": 0.3,
                "image": 0.7
            }
        }
    },
    # We specify which fields to create vectors for. 
    # Note that captioned_image is treated as a single field.
    tensor_fields=["captioned_image"]
)

# Search this index with a simple text query
results = mq.index("my-first-multimodal-index").search(
    q="Give me some images of vehicles and modes of transport. I am especially interested in air travel and commercial aeroplanes."
)

print("Query 1:")
pprint.pprint(results)

# search the index with a query that uses weighted components
results = mq.index("my-first-multimodal-index").search(
    q={
        "What are some vehicles and modes of transport?": 1.0,
        "Aeroplanes and other things that fly": -1.0
    },
)
print("\nQuery 2:")
pprint.pprint(results)

results = mq.index("my-first-multimodal-index").search(
    q={"Animals of the Perissodactyla order": -1.0}
)
print("\nQuery 3:")
pprint.pprint(results)
```
