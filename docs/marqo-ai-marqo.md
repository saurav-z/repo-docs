## Quick Start

Get up and running with Marqo in minutes!

1.  **Install Docker:**  If you don't have Docker installed, go to the [Docker Official website](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/). Ensure Docker has at least 8GB memory and 50GB storage.

2.  **Run Marqo using Docker:**

    ```bash
    docker rm -f marqo
    docker pull marqoai/marqo:latest
    docker run --name marqo -it -p 8882:8882 marqoai/marqo:latest
    ```
    *Note:  If the container is killed, increase Docker memory (8GB recommended) in Docker settings.*

3.  **Install the Marqo client:**

    ```bash
    pip install marqo
    ```

4.  **Start Indexing and Searching!**

    ```python
    import marqo

    mq = marqo.Client(url='http://localhost:8882')

    mq.create_index("my-first-index", model="hf/e5-base-v2")

    mq.index("my-first-index").add_documents([
        {
            "Title": "The Travels of Marco Polo",
            "Description": "A 13th-century travelogue describing Polo's travels"
        }, 
        {
            "Title": "Extravehicular Mobility Unit (EMU)",
            "Description": "The EMU is a spacesuit that provides environmental protection, "
                           "mobility, life support, and communications for astronauts",
            "_id": "article_591"
        }],
        tensor_fields=["Description"]
    )

    results = mq.index("my-first-index").search(
        q="What is the best outfit to wear on the moon?"
    )
    ```

    *   `mq` is the Marqo API client.
    *   `create_index()` creates a new index. Specify a model, e.g., `hf/e5-base-v2`.  Experiment to find the best model for your use case.
    *   `add_documents()` adds documents for indexing. `tensor_fields` specifies fields for vector indexing.
    *   You can use the special `_id` field to set a document ID.  Otherwise, Marqo will generate one.

    View results:

    ```python
    import pprint
    pprint.pprint(results)
    ```

    *   Each `hit` is a document matching the query, ordered by relevance.
    *   `_highlights` show the matching parts of the document.

##  Other Basic Operations

*   **Get document:** Retrieve by ID:
    ```python
    result = mq.index("my-first-index").get_document(document_id="article_591")
    ```

*   **Get index stats:**
    ```python
    results = mq.index("my-first-index").get_stats()
    ```

*   **Lexical search:** Keyword search:
    ```python
    result = mq.index("my-first-index").search('marco polo', search_method=marqo.SearchMethods.LEXICAL)
    ```

*   **Multimodal and Cross-Modal Search**:  Use CLIP models for image and text search:
    ```python
    settings = {
        "treat_urls_and_pointers_as_images":True,
        "model":"ViT-L/14"
    }
    response = mq.create_index("my-multimodal-index", **settings)

    response = mq.index("my-multimodal-index").add_documents([{
        "My_Image": "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/marqo-ai/marqo-api-tests/mainline/assets/ai_hippo_realistic.png",
        "Description": "The hippopotamus, also called the common hippopotamus or river hippopotamus, is a large semiaquatic mammal native to sub-Saharan Africa",
        "_id": "hippo-facts"
    }], tensor_fields=["My_Image"])

    results = mq.index("my-multimodal-index").search('animal')
    ```

*   **Image search**: Search using an image URL:
    ```python
    results = mq.index("my-multimodal-index").search('https://raw.githubusercontent.com/marqo-ai/marqo-api-tests/mainline/assets/ai_hippo_statue.png')
    ```

*   **Weighted Queries:**
    ```python
    import marqo
    import pprint

    mq = marqo.Client(url="http://localhost:8882")

    mq.create_index("my-weighted-query-index")

    mq.index("my-weighted-query-index").add_documents(
        [
            {
                "Title": "Smartphone",
                "Description": "A smartphone is a portable computer device that combines mobile telephone "
                "functions and computing functions into one unit.",
            },
            {
                "Title": "Telephone",
                "Description": "A telephone is a telecommunications device that permits two or more users to"
                "conduct a conversation when they are too far apart to be easily heard directly.",
            },
            {
                "Title": "Thylacine",
                "Description": "The thylacine, also commonly known as the Tasmanian tiger or Tasmanian wolf, "
                "is an extinct carnivorous marsupial."
                "The last known of its species died in 1936.",
            }
        ],
        tensor_fields=["Description"]
    )

    # initially we ask for a type of communications device which is popular in the 21st century
    query = {
        # a weighting of 1.1 gives this query slightly more importance
        "I need to buy a communications device, what should I get?": 1.1,
        # a weighting of 1 gives this query a neutral importance
        # this will lead to 'Smartphone' being the top result
        "The device should work like an intelligent computer.": 1.0,
    }

    results = mq.index("my-weighted-query-index").search(q=query)

    print("Query 1:")
    pprint.pprint(results)

    # now we ask for a type of communications which predates the 21st century
    query = {
        # a weighting of 1 gives this query a neutral importance
        "I need to buy a communications device, what should I get?": 1.0,
        # a weighting of -1 gives this query a negation effect
        # this will lead to 'Telephone' being the top result
        "The device should work like an intelligent computer.": -0.3,
    }

    results = mq.index("my-weighted-query-index").search(q=query)

    print("\nQuery 2:")
    pprint.pprint(results)
    ```

*   **Creating and searching indexes with multimodal combination fields**

    ```python
    import marqo
