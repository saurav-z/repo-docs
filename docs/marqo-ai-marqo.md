## Getting Started

Follow these steps to quickly get up and running with Marqo:

1.  **Install Docker:** Go to the [Docker Official website](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/) to install Docker. Ensure Docker has at least 8GB of memory (recommended) and 50GB of storage allocated.

2.  **Run Marqo with Docker:**

    ```bash
    docker rm -f marqo
    docker pull marqoai/marqo:latest
    docker run --name marqo -p 8882:8882 marqoai/marqo:latest
    ```
    *Note: If your `marqo` container keeps getting killed, increase the memory limit for Docker to at least 6GB (8GB recommended) in your Docker settings.*

3.  **Install the Marqo Client:**

    ```bash
    pip install marqo
    ```

4.  **Start Indexing and Searching:** Here's a basic example:

    ```python
    import marqo

    mq = marqo.Client(url='http://localhost:8882')

    mq.create_index("my-first-index", model="hf/e5-base-v2")  # or another model

    mq.index("my-first-index").add_documents([
        {
            "Title": "The Travels of Marco Polo",
            "Description": "A 13th-century travelogue describing Polo's travels"
        },
        {
            "Title": "Extravehicular Mobility Unit (EMU)",
            "Description": "The EMU is a spacesuit that provides environmental protection, "
                           "mobility, life support, and communications for astronauts",
            "_id": "article_591"
        }],
        tensor_fields=["Description"]
    )

    results = mq.index("my-first-index").search(
        q="What is the best outfit to wear on the moon?"
    )

    # Print the results
    import pprint
    pprint.pprint(results)
    ```

    *   `mq`: This is the client that wraps the `marqo` API.
    *   `create_index()`: Creates a new index.  You can specify the model (e.g., `hf/e5-base-v2`).
    *   `add_documents()`: Adds documents (represented as Python dictionaries) for indexing. `tensor_fields` specifies which fields to index as vector collections.
    *   You can optionally set a document's ID with the special `_id` field; otherwise, Marqo generates one.

    Example results output:

    ```
    {
        'hits': [
            {
                'Title': 'Extravehicular Mobility Unit (EMU)',
                'Description': 'The EMU is a spacesuit that provides environmental protection, mobility, life support, and'
                               'communications for astronauts',
                '_highlights': [{
                    'Description': 'The EMU is a spacesuit that provides environmental protection, '
                                   'mobility, life support, and communications for astronauts'
                }],
                '_id': 'article_591',
                '_score': 0.61938936
            },
            {
                'Title': 'The Travels of Marco Polo',
                'Description': "A 13th-century travelogue describing Polo's travels",
                '_highlights': [{'Title': 'The Travels of Marco Polo'}],
                '_id': 'e00d1a8d-894c-41a1-8e3b-d8b2a8fce12a',
                '_score': 0.60237324
            }
        ],
        'limit': 10,
        'processingTimeMs': 49,
        'query': 'What is the best outfit to wear on the moon?'
    }
    ```

    *   Each `hit` is a matching document.
    *   Documents are ordered by relevance (`_score`).
    *   `_highlights` show the matching parts of documents.

## Other Basic Operations

### Get Document

```python
result = mq.index("my-first-index").get_document(document_id="article_591")
```

*Note: Adding a document using `add_documents` with the same `_id` will update the document.*

### Get Index Stats

```python
results = mq.index("my-first-index").get_stats()
```

### Lexical Search

```python
result = mq.index("my-first-index").search('marco polo', search_method=marqo.SearchMethods.LEXICAL)
```

### Multi-Modal and Cross-Modal Search

Marqo lets you easily perform image and text search with CLIP models from Hugging Face. **Important:**  If multimodal search isn't configured, image URLs are treated as strings. Create an index with a CLIP configuration like so:

```python
settings = {
    "treat_urls_and_pointers_as_images":True,
    "model":"ViT-L/14"
}
response = mq.create_index("my-multimodal-index", **settings)
```

Then add images to your documents:

```python
response = mq.index("my-multimodal-index").add_documents([{
    "My_Image": "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/marqo-ai/marqo-api-tests/mainline/assets/ai_hippo_realistic.png",
    "Description": "The hippopotamus, also called the common hippopotamus or river hippopotamus, is a large semiaquatic mammal native to sub-Saharan Africa",
    "_id": "hippo-facts"
}], tensor_fields=["My_Image"])
```

Search the image field using text:

```python
results = mq.index("my-multimodal-index").search('animal')
```

### Searching Using an Image

Search with an image link directly:

```python
results = mq.index("my-multimodal-index").search('https://raw.githubusercontent.com/marqo-ai/marqo-api-tests/mainline/assets/ai_hippo_statue.png')
```

### Searching with Weights in Queries

Use weighted queries for advanced searches:

```python
import marqo
import pprint

mq = marqo.Client(url="http://localhost:8882")

mq.create_index("my-weighted-query-index")

mq.index("my-weighted-query-index").add_documents(
    [
        {
            "Title": "Smartphone",
            "Description": "A smartphone is a portable computer device that combines mobile telephone "
            "functions and computing functions into one unit.",
        },
        {
            "Title": "Telephone",
            "Description": "A telephone is a telecommunications device that permits two or more users to"
            "conduct a conversation when they are too far apart to be easily heard directly.",
        },
        {
            "Title": "Thylacine",
            "Description": "The thylacine, also commonly known as the Tasmanian tiger or Tasmanian wolf, "
            "is an extinct carnivorous marsupial."
            "The last known of its species died in 1936.",
        }
    ],
    tensor_fields=["Description"]
)

# Example 1: Communications device
query = {
    "I need to buy a communications device, what should I get?": 1.1,
    "The device should work like an intelligent computer.": 1.0,
}
results = mq.index("my-weighted-query-index").search(q=query)

print("Query 1:")
pprint.pprint(results)

# Example 2: Negating a term
query = {
    "I need to buy a communications device, what should I get?": 1.0,
    "The device should work like an intelligent computer.": -0.3,
}

results = mq.index("my-weighted-query-index").search(q=query)

print("\nQuery 2:")
pprint.pprint(results)
```

### Creating and Searching Indexes with Multimodal Combination Fields

Combine text and images in a single field and specify weights:

```python
import marqo
import pprint

mq = marqo.Client(url="http://localhost:8882")

settings = {"treat_urls_and_pointers_as_images": True, "model": "ViT-L/14"}

mq.create_index("my-first-multimodal-index", **settings)

mq.index("my-first-multimodal-index").add_documents(
    [
        {
            "Title": "Flying Plane",
            "caption": "An image of a passenger plane flying in front of the moon.",
            "image": "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/marqo-ai/marqo/mainline/examples/ImageSearchGuide/data/image2.jpg",
        },
        {
            "Title": "Red Bus",
            "caption": "A red double decker London bus traveling to Aldwych",
            "image": "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/marqo-ai/marqo/mainline/examples/ImageSearchGuide/data/image4.jpg",
        },
        {
            "Title": "Horse Jumping",
            "caption": "A person riding a horse over a jump in a competition.",
            "image": "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/marqo-ai/marqo/mainline/examples/ImageSearchGuide/data/image1.jpg",
        },
    ],
    mappings={
        "captioned_image": {
            "type": "multimodal_combination",
            "weights": {
                "caption": 0.3,
                "image": 0.7
            }
        }
    },
    tensor_fields=["captioned_image"]
)

# Example 1: Text query
results = mq.index("my-first-multimodal-index").search(
    q="Give me some images of vehicles and modes of transport. I am especially interested in air travel and commercial aeroplanes."
)

print("Query 1:")
pprint.pprint(results)

# Example 2: Weighted query
results = mq.index("my-first-multimodal-index").search(
    q={
        "What are some vehicles and modes of transport?": 1.0,
        "Aeroplanes and other things that fly": -1.0
    },
)
print("\nQuery 2:")
pprint.pprint(results)

# Example 3: Negation
results = mq.index("my-first-multimodal-index").search(
    q={"Animals of the Perissodactyla order": -1.0}
)
print("\nQuery 3:")
pprint.pprint(results)
```

### Delete Documents

```python
results = mq.index("my-first-index").delete_documents(ids=["article_591", "article_602"])
```
