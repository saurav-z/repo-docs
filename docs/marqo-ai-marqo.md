## Getting Started

Follow these steps to get up and running with Marqo:

1.  **Install Docker:**  Ensure Docker is installed with at least 8GB memory and 50GB storage.
2.  **Run Marqo with Docker:**

```bash
docker rm -f marqo
docker pull marqoai/marqo:latest
docker run --name marqo -it -p 8882:8882 marqoai/marqo:latest
```

3.  **Install the Marqo Client:**

```bash
pip install marqo
```

4.  **Start Indexing and Searching:**

```python
import marqo

mq = marqo.Client(url='http://localhost:8882')

mq.create_index("my-first-index", model="hf/e5-base-v2")

mq.index("my-first-index").add_documents([
    {
        "Title": "The Travels of Marco Polo",
        "Description": "A 13th-century travelogue describing Polo's travels"
    }, 
    {
        "Title": "Extravehicular Mobility Unit (EMU)",
        "Description": "The EMU is a spacesuit that provides environmental protection, "
                       "mobility, life support, and communications for astronauts",
        "_id": "article_591"
    }],
    tensor_fields=["Description"]
)

results = mq.index("my-first-index").search(
    q="What is the best outfit to wear on the moon?"
)
```

*   `mq` is the client that wraps the `marqo` API.
*   `create_index()` creates a new index with default settings. You have the option to specify what model to use. For example, `mq.create_index("my-first-index", model="hf/e5-base-v2")` will create an index with the default text model `hf/e5-base-v2`. Experimentation with different models is often required to achieve the best retrieval for your specific use case. Different models also offer a tradeoff between inference speed and relevancy. See [here](https://docs.marqo.ai/1.0.0/Models-Reference/dense_retrieval/) for the full list of models.
*   `add_documents()` takes a list of documents, represented as python dicts for indexing. `tensor_fields` refers to the fields that will be indexed as vector collections and made searchable.
*   You can optionally set a document's ID with the special `_id` field. Otherwise, Marqo will generate one.

Let's have a look at the results:

```python
# let's print out the results:
import pprint
pprint.pprint(results)

{
    'hits': [
        {
            'Title': 'Extravehicular Mobility Unit (EMU)',
            'Description': 'The EMU is a spacesuit that provides environmental protection, mobility, life support, and'
                           'communications for astronauts',
            '_highlights': [{
                'Description': 'The EMU is a spacesuit that provides environmental protection, '
                               'mobility, life support, and communications for astronauts'
            }],
            '_id': 'article_591',
            '_score': 0.61938936
        },
        {
            'Title': 'The Travels of Marco Polo',
            'Description': "A 13th-century travelogue describing Polo's travels",
            '_highlights': [{'Title': 'The Travels of Marco Polo'}],
            '_id': 'e00d1a8d-894c-41a1-8e3b-d8b2a8fce12a',
            '_score': 0.60237324
        }
    ],
    'limit': 10,
    'processingTimeMs': 49,
    'query': 'What is the best outfit to wear on the moon?'
}
```

- Each hit corresponds to a document that matched the search query.
- They are ordered from most to least matching.
- `limit` is the maximum number of hits to be returned. This can be set as a parameter during search.
- Each hit has a `_highlights` field. This was the part of the document that matched the query the best.

## Other Basic Operations

### Get Document

Retrieve a document by ID.

```python
result = mq.index("my-first-index").get_document(document_id="article_591")
```

Note that by adding the document using ```add_documents``` again using the same ```_id``` will cause a document to be updated.

### Get Index Stats

Get information about an index.

```python
results = mq.index("my-first-index").get_stats()
```

### Lexical Search

Perform a keyword search.

```python
result = mq.index("my-first-index").search('marco polo', search_method=marqo.SearchMethods.LEXICAL)
```

### Multi-Modal and Cross-Modal Search

Marqo supports image and text search using CLIP models.

```python
settings = {
    "treat_urls_and_pointers_as_images":True,   # allows us to find an image file and index it 
    "model":"ViT-L/14"
}
response = mq.create_index("my-multimodal-index", **settings)
```

Images can then be added within documents as follows. You can use urls from the internet (for example S3) or from the disk of the machine:

```python
response = mq.index("my-multimodal-index").add_documents([{
    "My_Image": "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/marqo-ai/marqo-api-tests/mainline/assets/ai_hippo_realistic.png",
    "Description": "The hippopotamus, also called the common hippopotamus or river hippopotamus, is a large semiaquatic mammal native to sub-Saharan Africa",
    "_id": "hippo-facts"
}], tensor_fields=["My_Image"])
```

You can then search the image field using text.

```python
results = mq.index("my-multimodal-index").search('animal')
```

### Searching Using an Image

Search by providing an image link.

```python
results = mq.index("my-multimodal-index").search('https://raw.githubusercontent.com/marqo-ai/marqo-api-tests/mainline/assets/ai_hippo_statue.png')
```

### Searching Using Weights in Queries

Create advanced queries with weighted components, including negations.

```python
import marqo
import pprint

mq = marqo.Client(url="http://localhost:8882")

mq.create_index("my-weighted-query-index")

mq.index("my-weighted-query-index").add_documents(
    [
        {
            "Title": "Smartphone",
            "Description": "A smartphone is a portable computer device that combines mobile telephone "
            "functions and computing functions into one unit.",
        },
        {
            "Title": "Telephone",
            "Description": "A telephone is a telecommunications device that permits two or more users to"
            "conduct a conversation when they are too far apart to be easily heard directly.",
        },
        {
            "Title": "Thylacine",
            "Description": "The thylacine, also commonly known as the Tasmanian tiger or Tasmanian wolf, "
            "is an extinct carnivorous marsupial."
            "The last known of its species died in 1936.",
        }
    ],
    tensor_fields=["Description"]
)

# initially we ask for a type of communications device which is popular in the 21st century
query = {
    # a weighting of 1.1 gives this query slightly more importance
    "I need to buy a communications device, what should I get?": 1.1,
    # a weighting of 1 gives this query a neutral importance
    # this will lead to 'Smartphone' being the top result
    "The device should work like an intelligent computer.": 1.0,
}

results = mq.index("my-weighted-query-index").search(q=query)

print("Query 1:")
pprint.pprint(results)

# now we ask for a type of communications which predates the 21st century
query = {
    # a weighting of 1 gives this query a neutral importance
    "I need to buy a communications device, what should I get?": 1.0,
    # a weighting of -1 gives this query a negation effect
    # this will lead to 'Telephone' being the top result
    "The device should work like an intelligent computer.": -0.3,
}

results = mq.index("my-weighted-query-index").search(q=query)

print("\nQuery 2:")
pprint.pprint(results)
```

### Creating and Searching Indexes with Multimodal Combination Fields

```python
import marqo
import pprint

mq = marqo.Client(url="http://localhost:8882")

settings = {"treat_urls_and_pointers_as_images": True, "model": "ViT-L/14"}

mq.create_index("my-first-multimodal-index", **settings)

mq.index("my-first-multimodal-index").add_documents(
    [
        {
            "Title": "Flying Plane",
            "caption": "An image of a passenger plane flying in front of the moon.",
            "image": "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/marqo-ai/marqo/mainline/examples/ImageSearchGuide/data/image2.jpg",
        },
        {
            "Title": "Red Bus",
            "caption": "A red double decker London bus traveling to Aldwych",
            "image": "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/marqo-ai/marqo/mainline/examples/ImageSearchGuide/data/image4.jpg",
        },
        {
            "Title": "Horse Jumping",
            "caption": "A person riding a horse over a jump in a competition.",
            "image": "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/marqo-ai/marqo/mainline/examples/ImageSearchGuide/data/image1.jpg",
        },
    ],
    # Create the mappings, here we define our captioned_image mapping 
    # which weights the image more heavily than the caption - these pairs 
    # will be represented by a single vector in the index
    mappings={
        "captioned_image": {
            "type": "multimodal_combination",
            "weights": {
                "caption": 0.3,
                "image": 0.7
            }
        }
    },
    # We specify which fields to create vectors for. 
    # Note that captioned_image is treated as a single field.
    tensor_fields=["captioned_image"]
)

# Search this index with a simple text query
results = mq.index("my-first-multimodal-index").search(
    q="Give me some images of vehicles and modes of transport. I am especially interested in air travel and commercial aeroplanes."
)

print("Query 1:")
pprint.pprint(results)

# search the index with a query that uses weighted components
results = mq.index("my-first-multimodal-index").search(
    q={
        "What are some vehicles and modes of transport?": 1.0,
        "Aeroplanes and other things that fly": -1.0
    },
)
print("\nQuery 2:")
pprint.pprint(results)

results = mq.index("my-first-multimodal-index").search(
    q={"Animals of the Perissodactyla order": -1.0}
)
print("\nQuery 3:")
pprint.pprint(results)
```
