## Getting Started

1.  **Prerequisites:** Docker is required. Install it from the [Docker Official website](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/). Ensure Docker has at least 8GB of memory and 50GB of storage allocated.
2.  **Run Marqo with Docker:**
    ```bash
    docker rm -f marqo
    docker pull marqoai/marqo:latest
    docker run --name marqo -p 8882:8882 marqoai/marqo:latest
    ```
    *Note: If your `marqo` container crashes, increase Docker's memory allocation to at least 6GB (8GB recommended).*
3.  **Install the Marqo client:**
    ```bash
    pip install marqo
    ```
4.  **Start indexing and searching!**
    ```python
    import marqo

    mq = marqo.Client(url='http://localhost:8882')

    mq.create_index("my-first-index", model="hf/e5-base-v2") # Specify model
    mq.index("my-first-index").add_documents([
        {
            "Title": "The Travels of Marco Polo",
            "Description": "A 13th-century travelogue describing Polo's travels"
        },
        {
            "Title": "Extravehicular Mobility Unit (EMU)",
            "Description": "The EMU is a spacesuit that provides environmental protection, "
                           "mobility, life support, and communications for astronauts",
            "_id": "article_591"
        }],
        tensor_fields=["Description"]
    )

    results = mq.index("my-first-index").search(
        q="What is the best outfit to wear on the moon?"
    )
    ```

    *   `mq` is the Marqo client.
    *   `create_index()` creates a new index. You can specify the model (e.g., `"hf/e5-base-v2"`). Experiment to find the best model for your use case.
    *   `add_documents()` adds documents for indexing. `tensor_fields` specifies fields to index as vector collections.
    *   You can set a document's ID with the `_id` field. Marqo generates one if not provided.

    Example Results:

    ```python
    import pprint
    pprint.pprint(results)
    ```

    *Each hit shows a document matching the search query, ordered by relevance.*  `_highlights` indicates the matched portion, and `_score` is the relevancy score.

## Other Basic Operations

### Get Document

```python
result = mq.index("my-first-index").get_document(document_id="article_591")
```

*   *Note:* Adding a document with the same `_id` updates the existing document.

### Get Index Stats

```python
results = mq.index("my-first-index").get_stats()
```

### Lexical Search

```python
result = mq.index("my-first-index").search('marco polo', search_method=marqo.SearchMethods.LEXICAL)
```

### Multi Modal and Cross Modal Search

Marqo supports image and text search using CLIP models.

1.  **Create an index with CLIP configuration:**

    ```python
    settings = {
        "treat_urls_and_pointers_as_images":True,   # allows us to find an image file and index it
        "model":"ViT-L/14"
    }
    response = mq.create_index("my-multimodal-index", **settings)
    ```

2.  **Add images to documents:**

    ```python
    response = mq.index("my-multimodal-index").add_documents([{
        "My_Image": "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/marqo-ai/marqo-api-tests/mainline/assets/ai_hippo_realistic.png",
        "Description": "The hippopotamus, also called the common hippopotamus or river hippopotamus, is a large semiaquatic mammal native to sub-Saharan Africa",
        "_id": "hippo-facts"
    }], tensor_fields=["My_Image"])
    ```

3.  **Search images using text:**

    ```python
    results = mq.index("my-multimodal-index").search('animal')
    ```

### Searching Using an Image

```python
results = mq.index("my-multimodal-index").search('https://raw.githubusercontent.com/marqo-ai/marqo-api-tests/mainline/assets/ai_hippo_statue.png')
```

### Searching with Weighted Queries

```python
import marqo
import pprint

mq = marqo.Client(url="http://localhost:8882")

mq.create_index("my-weighted-query-index")

mq.index("my-weighted-query-index").add_documents(
    [
        {
            "Title": "Smartphone",
            "Description": "A smartphone is a portable computer device that combines mobile telephone "
            "functions and computing functions into one unit.",
        },
        {
            "Title": "Telephone",
            "Description": "A telephone is a telecommunications device that permits two or more users to"
            "conduct a conversation when they are too far apart to be easily heard directly.",
        },
        {
            "Title": "Thylacine",
            "Description": "The thylacine, also commonly known as the Tasmanian tiger or Tasmanian wolf, "
            "is an extinct carnivorous marsupial."
            "The last known of its species died in 1936.",
        }
    ],
    tensor_fields=["Description"]
)

# Example of weighted and negated queries
query = {
    # a weighting of 1.1 gives this query slightly more importance
    "I need to buy a communications device, what should I get?": 1.1,
    # a weighting of 1 gives this query a neutral importance
    # this will lead to 'Smartphone' being the top result
    "The device should work like an intelligent computer.": 1.0,
}

results = mq.index("my-weighted-query-index").search(q=query)

print("Query 1:")
pprint.pprint(results)

# Example of weighted and negated queries
query = {
    # a weighting of 1 gives this query a neutral importance
    "I need to buy a communications device, what should I get?": 1.0,
    # a weighting of -1 gives this query a negation effect
    # this will lead to 'Telephone' being the top result
    "The device should work like an intelligent computer.": -0.3,
}

results = mq.index("my-weighted-query-index").search(q=query)

print("\nQuery 2:")
pprint.pprint(results)
```

### Creating and Searching Indexes with Multimodal Combination Fields

```python
import marqo
import pprint

mq = marqo.Client(url="http://localhost:8882")

settings = {"treat_urls_and_pointers_as_images": True, "model": "ViT-L/14"}

mq.create_index("my-first-multimodal-index", **settings)

mq.index("my-first-multimodal-index").add_documents(
    [
        {
            "Title": "Flying Plane",
            "caption": "An image of a passenger plane flying in front of the moon.",
            "image": "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/marqo-ai/marqo/mainline/examples/ImageSearchGuide/data/image2.jpg",
        },
        {
            "Title": "Red Bus",
            "caption": "A red double decker London bus traveling to Aldwych",
            "image": "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/marqo-ai/marqo/mainline/examples/ImageSearchGuide/data/image4.jpg",
        },
        {
            "Title": "Horse Jumping",
            "caption": "A person riding a horse over a jump in a competition.",
            "image": "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/marqo-ai/marqo/mainline/examples/ImageSearchGuide/data/image1.jpg",
        },
    ],
    # Create the mappings, here we define our captioned_image mapping
    # which weights the image more heavily than the caption - these pairs
    # will be represented by a single vector in the index
    mappings={
        "captioned_image": {
            "type": "multimodal_combination",
            "weights": {
                "caption": 0.3,
                "image": 0.7
            }
        }
    },
    # We specify which fields to create vectors for.
    # Note that captioned_image is treated as a single field.
    tensor_fields=["captioned_image"]
)

# Search this index with a simple text query
results = mq.index("my-first-multimodal-index").search(
    q="Give me some images of vehicles and modes of transport. I am especially interested in air travel and commercial aeroplanes."
)

print("Query 1:")
pprint.pprint(results)

# search the index with a query that uses weighted components
results = mq.index("my-first-multimodal-index").search(
    q={
        "What are some vehicles and modes of transport?": 1.0,
        "Aeroplanes and other things that fly": -1.0
    },
)
print("\nQuery 2:")
pprint.pprint(results)

results = mq.index("my-first-multimodal-index").search(
    q={"Animals of the Perissodactyla order": -1.0}
)
print("\nQuery 3:")
pprint.pprint(results)
```

results = mq.index("my-first-index").delete_documents(ids=["article_591", "article_602"])
```

### Delete Index
