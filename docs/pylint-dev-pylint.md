# Pylint: Static Code Analysis for Python

**Pylint is a powerful, customizable static code analyzer for Python that helps you write cleaner, more maintainable code.** ([View on GitHub](https://github.com/pylint-dev/pylint))

## Key Features:

*   **Error Detection:** Identifies potential errors in your Python code without execution.
*   **Coding Standard Enforcement:** Enforces a consistent coding style to improve readability and maintainability.
*   **Code Smell Detection:** Flags "code smells" indicating potential design problems or areas for refactoring.
*   **Customizable Rules:** Highly configurable to match your specific coding preferences and project requirements.
*   **Plugin Ecosystem:** Supports plugins for popular frameworks and libraries to extend its functionality.
*   **Inferencing:** In-depth code analysis that uses its internal code representation (astroid) to infer the actual values of nodes, providing more accurate and thorough results.
*   **Integration:** Easy integration with popular IDEs and editors.
*   **Additional Tools:** Includes `pyreverse` for generating diagrams and `symilar` for duplicate code detection.

## Installation

Install Pylint using pip:

```bash
pip install pylint
```

To enable spell-checking (requires `enchant` and potentially the Enchant C library):

```bash
pip install pylint[spelling]
```

## Differentiating Features

Pylint stands out from other linters through its rigorous analysis, employing astroid to infer the values of nodes. While this can make Pylint slower, it allows for more in-depth and accurate detection of issues, even in less-typed code.  Pylint's comprehensive checks and highly configurable settings make it a powerful tool for enforcing coding standards and identifying potential problems within a project.

## Getting Started

*   Start by running `pylint <your_python_file.py>`.
*   Gradually adjust settings and disable rules using the `--disable` flag.

## Useful Tools

Pylint ships with these additional tools:

*   `pyreverse`: A standalone tool that generates package and class diagrams.
*   `symilar`: A duplicate code finder integrated into pylint.
