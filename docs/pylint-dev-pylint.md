# Pylint: Static Code Analysis for Python

**Pylint is a powerful and customizable static code analyzer that helps you write cleaner, more maintainable Python code.**  Check out the original repository [here](https://github.com/pylint-dev/pylint).

## Key Features

*   **Error Detection:** Identifies errors, potential bugs, and code smells in your Python code *without* running it.
*   **Coding Standard Enforcement:** Enforces a coding style (PEP 8 or custom) to improve code readability and consistency.
*   **Customizable Checks:** Offers a wide range of configurable checks and the ability to create custom plugins for project-specific rules.
*   **Inference Engine:** Leverages a robust inference engine to understand your code's structure and catch issues that other linters might miss.
*   **Integration:** Easily integrates with popular IDEs and editors for real-time feedback and code analysis.
*   **Comprehensive Reporting:** Provides detailed reports on code quality, including metrics like code complexity, duplication, and potential issues.
*   **Additional Tools:** Includes useful tools like pyreverse (for generating UML diagrams) and symilar (for finding duplicate code).

## Installation

Install Pylint using pip:

```bash
pip install pylint
```

For spell checking support, install with:

```bash
pip install pylint[spelling]
```

## How Pylint Works

Pylint analyzes your Python code without executing it, examining it for errors, style violations, and potential improvements.  It uses an advanced inference engine to understand code relationships, even in dynamically typed code, allowing it to detect issues other tools may miss.

## Why Choose Pylint?

Pylint stands out with its deep analysis capabilities, going beyond basic syntax checking. It offers a comprehensive suite of checks, including many that are configurable to your specific needs. This helps you maintain high code quality and prevent potential problems.

## Using Pylint

*   Start with the `--errors-only` flag to focus on critical issues.
*   Disable convention and refactor messages using `--disable=C,R` to reduce noise.
*   Progressively re-enable checks as your project's priorities evolve.
*   Explore plugins to support third-party libraries.

## Tools to Use Alongside Pylint

Pylint works well with other tools like:

*   Ruff
*   Flake8
*   Mypy
*   Pyright / Pylance
*   Pyre
*   Bandit
*   Black and isort
*   Autoflake
*   Pyupgrade
