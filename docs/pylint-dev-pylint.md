# Pylint: Your Go-To Static Code Analyzer for Python

Pylint is a powerful and versatile static code analysis tool that helps you write cleaner, more maintainable Python code. ([See the original repository](https://github.com/pylint-dev/pylint)).

## Key Features:

*   **Error Detection:** Identifies common programming errors, potential bugs, and style violations.
*   **Coding Standard Enforcement:** Enforces PEP 8 and other coding standards to improve code readability and consistency.
*   **Code Smell Detection:** Flags code smells, such as overly complex methods or duplicated code, that can indicate design flaws.
*   **Customization and Configuration:** Highly configurable, allowing you to tailor checks and rules to your project's specific needs.
*   **Plugin Ecosystem:** Supports plugins to extend functionality for specific frameworks and libraries (e.g., pylint-django, pylint-pydantic).
*   **Inferencing Engine:** Uses an inference engine (astroid) to understand code semantics, even in the absence of type hints, leading to more accurate analysis.
*   **Integration:** Seamlessly integrates with most IDEs and editors.
*   **Additional tools:** Includes `pyreverse` (for UML diagrams) and `symilar` (for duplicate code detection).

## Installation

Install Pylint using pip:

```bash
pip install pylint
```

For spell checking (requires `enchant` and may require installing the Enchant C library):

```bash
pip install pylint[spelling]
```

## How Pylint Differs

Pylint goes beyond basic linting by using astroid to infer the actual values of code, not just relying on typing. This enables it to catch more errors, even in dynamically typed code, which can be slower but more thorough. Pylint offers a vast array of checks, some configurable and disabled by default, providing greater control over code quality analysis.

## Usage Tips

*   Start with the `--errors-only` flag to focus on critical issues.
*   Disable convention and refactor messages (`--disable=C,R`) initially.
*   Gradually re-enable messages as your project evolves.
*   Use plugins for third-party library support.

## Recommended Complementary Tools

Enhance your Python development workflow with these tools:

*   **Ruff:** Fast linter with built-in autofix and many checks from popular linters (written in Rust).
*   **Flake8:** Flexible framework to implement your own checks in Python.
*   **Mypy, Pyright/Pylance, Pyre:** Type checking.
*   **Bandit:** Security-focused checks.
*   **Black and isort:** Code formatting and import sorting.
*   **Autoflake:** Removes unused imports and variables.
*   **Pyupgrade:** Upgrades code to newer Python syntax.
*   **Pydocstringformatter:** Formats docstrings (PEP 257).
