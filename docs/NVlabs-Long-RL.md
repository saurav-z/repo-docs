## LongVILA-R1 Model Usage

### General Inference

```python
from transformers import AutoModel

model_path = "Efficient-Large-Model/LongVILA-R1-7B"
model = AutoModel.from_pretrained(model_path, trust_remote_code=True, device_map="auto")

# You can adjust the FPS value as needed.
# To disable FPS control, set it to 0 and manually specify the number of processed video frames via `num_video_frames`.
# Example:
# model.config.fps = 8.0
# model.config.num_video_frames, model.config.fps = 512, 0


use_thinking = True # Switching between thinking and non-thinking modes
system_prompt_thinking = "You are a helpful assistant. The user asks a question, and then you solves it.\n\nPlease first think deeply about the question based on the given video, and then provide the final answer. The reasoning process and answer are enclosed within <think> </think> and <answer> </answer> tags, respectively, i.e., <think> reasoning process here </think> <answer> answer here </answer>.\n\n Question: {question}"

prompt = "What is the main purpose of the video?"
video_path = "video.mp4"

if use_thinking:
  prompt = system_prompt_thinking.format(question=prompt)

response = model.generate_content([prompt, {"path": video_path}])
print("Response: ", response)
```

### with vLLM engine

Tested on `vllm==0.9.1`. We need to get the remote code first.

```bash
mkdir remote_code
cp path_to/Efficient-Large-Model/LongVILA-R1-7B/*.py remote_code
```

Then, you can use the following code for model generation.

```python
import os
from transformers import AutoModel
from vllm import LLM, SamplingParams
from remote_code.media import extract_media
from remote_code.mm_utils import process_images
from remote_code.tokenizer_utils import tokenize_conversation

model_path = "path_to/Efficient-Large-Model/LongVILA-R1-7B"

model_encoder = AutoModel.from_pretrained(model_path, trust_remote_code=True, device_map="auto", llm_only_need_embed=True)
# you can change gpu_memory_utilization according to GPU memory
llm = LLM(model=os.path.join(model_path, "llm"), enable_prompt_embeds=True, gpu_memory_utilization=0.5)

use_thinking = True # Switching between thinking and non-thinking modes
system_prompt_thinking = "You are a helpful assistant. The user asks a question, and then you solves it.\n\nPlease first think deeply about the question based on the given video, and then provide the final answer. The reasoning process and answer are enclosed within <think> </think> and <answer> </answer> tags, respectively, i.e., <think> reasoning process here </think> <answer> answer here </answer>.\n\n Question: {question}"

prompt = "What is the main purpose of the video?"
video_path = "video.mp4"

if use_thinking:
  prompt = system_prompt_thinking.format(question=prompt)

conversation = [{"from": "human", "value": [prompt, {"path": video_path}]}]
media = extract_media(conversation, model_encoder.config)
input_ids = tokenize_conversation(conversation, model_encoder.tokenizer, add_generation_prompt=True).unsqueeze(0).cuda()
media["video"] = [
    process_images(images, model_encoder.vision_tower.image_processor, model_encoder.config).half()
    for images in media["video"]
]

inputs_embeds, _, _ = model_encoder._embed(input_ids, media, {"video": {}}, None, None)

completions = llm.generate(prompts=[{"prompt_embeds": inputs_embeds.squeeze(0)}], sampling_params=SamplingParams(max_tokens=1024))
response = completions[0].outputs[0].text
print("Response: ", response)
```

## Supported Features

*   [x] **Open-ended reward**:
    *   We support training for open-ended QAs (non-multi-choices QAs). Please do the following steps if you neet it.
        *   Set `--worker.rollout.open_ended_reward=True` in the training script.
        *   Export your openai API with `export OPENAI_API_KEY=xxx`.
*   [x] **Cached video embeddings**:
    *   We support using cached video embeddings for video RL training. Because video encoding during training is slow for large batch & long video frames. Please do the following steps if you neet it.
        *   Follow `verl/utils/cache_video_embeds_vila.py` to cache video embeddings in a local directory.
        *   Set `--data.cache_dir` and `--worker.actor.cached_embeds_dir` in the training script.
*   [x] **Chunked gathering**:
    *   We support chunked gathering for `all_gather_data_proto`. Because it might suffer from CPU OOM if you machine do not have enough CPU memory, and also large batches or long video frames are needed. Please do the following step if you neet it.
        *   Set `--worker.rollout.num_chunk_seq` in the training script. It can be 8/16/32. Larger ones cost less memory, but more time.

## Installation

```bash
git clone https://github.com/NVlabs/Long-RL.git
cd Long-RL
pip install -e .
```

If you want to train Qwen-Omni models, please

```bash
bash vllm_replace.sh
```

## Training

### Single node

For single node (within 8 GPUs), you can refer to the training scripts in the `examples` directory. For example,

```bash
bash examples/new_supports/qwen2_5_vl_3b_video_grpo.sh $VIDEO_PATH
```

### Multi-nodes

For jobs that requires multi-nodes, you can refer to the ways mentioned in the EasyR1 repo, [here](https://github.com/hiyouga/EasyR1/tree/main?tab=readme-ov-file#how-to-run-70b-model-in-multi-node-environment).

We provide additional examples for `sbatch` scripts like, where `TRAIN_SCRIPT` is the script to train on single node, `NNODES` is the number of nodes required.

```bash
bash scripts/srun_multi_nodes.sh $TRAIN_SCRIPT $NNODES
```

For example,

```bash
bash scripts/srun_multi_nodes.sh examples/new_supports/qwen2_5_vl_3b_video_grpo.sh 2
```

### Merge Checkpoint in Hugging Face Format

This follows the ways in the EasyR1 repo.

```bash
python3 scripts/model_merger.py --local_dir checkpoints/easy_r1/exp_name/global_step_1/actor
```

## LongVideo-Reason

We provide detailed instructions on the data generation process and how to evaluate models on our `LongVideo-Reason` benchmark in the [`longvideo-reason`](longvideo-reason/) directory.
