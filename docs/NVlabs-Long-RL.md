## Introduction

Long-RL addresses the challenges of long video understanding with a comprehensive framework, integrating:

*   **LongVideo-Reason Dataset:** A large-scale dataset with 104K long video QA pairs.
*   **Two-Stage Training:**  Combines chain-of-thought supervised fine-tuning (CoT-SFT) and reinforcement learning (RL).
*   **MR-SP Training Infrastructure:** Optimized for long video RL training, utilizing sequence parallelism and a vLLM-based engine.

## Model Usage: LongVILA-R1

### General Inference
```python
from transformers import AutoModel

model_path = "Efficient-Large-Model/LongVILA-R1-7B"
model = AutoModel.from_pretrained(model_path, trust_remote_code=True, device_map="auto")

# You can adjust the FPS value as needed. 
# To disable FPS control, set it to 0 and manually specify the number of processed video frames via `num_video_frames`.
# Example:
# model.config.fps = 8.0
# model.config.num_video_frames, model.config.fps = 512, 0


use_thinking = True # Switching between thinking and non-thinking modes
system_prompt_thinking = "You are a helpful assistant. The user asks a question, and then you solves it.\n\nPlease first think deeply about the question based on the given video, and then provide the final answer. The reasoning process and answer are enclosed within <think> </think> and <answer> </answer> tags, respectively, i.e., <think> reasoning process here </think> <answer> answer here </answer>.\n\n Question: {question}"

prompt = "What is the main purpose of the video?"
video_path = "video.mp4"

if use_thinking:
  prompt = system_prompt_thinking.format(question=prompt)

response = model.generate_content([prompt, {"path": video_path}])
print("Response: ", response)
```

### with vLLM engine
Tested on `vllm==0.9.1`. We need to get the remote code first.
```bash
mkdir remote_code
cp path_to/Efficient-Large-Model/LongVILA-R1-7B/*.py remote_code
```
Then, you can use the following code for model generation.
```python
import os
from transformers import AutoModel
from vllm import LLM, SamplingParams
from remote_code.media import extract_media
from remote_code.mm_utils import process_images
from remote_code.tokenizer_utils import tokenize_conversation

model_path = "path_to/Efficient-Large-Model/LongVILA-R1-7B"

model_encoder = AutoModel.from_pretrained(model_path, trust_remote_code=True, device_map="auto", llm_only_need_embed=True)
# you can change gpu_memory_utilization according to GPU memory
llm = LLM(model=os.path.join(model_path, "llm"), enable_prompt_embeds=True, gpu_memory_utilization=0.5)

use_thinking = True # Switching between thinking and non-thinking modes
system_prompt_thinking = "You are a helpful assistant. The user asks a question, and then you solves it.\n\nPlease first think deeply about the question based on the given video, and then provide the final answer. The reasoning process and answer are enclosed within <think> </think> and <answer> </answer> tags, respectively, i.e., <think> reasoning process here </think> <answer> answer here </answer>.\n\n Question: {question}"

prompt = "What is the main purpose of the video?"
video_path = "video.mp4"

if use_thinking:
  prompt = system_prompt_thinking.format(question=prompt)

conversation = [{"from": "human", "value": [prompt, {"path": video_path}]}]
media = extract_media(conversation, model_encoder.config)
input_ids = tokenize_conversation(conversation, model_encoder.tokenizer, add_generation_prompt=True).unsqueeze(0).cuda()
media["video"] = [
    process_images(images, model_encoder.vision_tower.image_processor, model_encoder.config).half()
    for images in media["video"]
]

inputs_embeds, _, _ = model_encoder._embed(input_ids, media, {"video": {}}, None, None)

completions = llm.generate(prompts=[{"prompt_embeds": inputs_embeds.squeeze(0)}], sampling_params=SamplingParams(max_tokens=1024))
response = completions[0].outputs[0].text
print("Response: ", response)
```

### Supported Features
