### üöÄ Get Started

Refer to the [Quick Start](https://open-llm-vtuber.github.io/docs/quick-start) guide for installation instructions.

---

### ‚òù Update
> :warning: `v1.0.0` has breaking changes and requires re-deployment. You *may* still update via the method below, but the `conf.yaml` file is incompatible and most of the dependencies needs to be reinstalled with `uv`. For those who came from versions before `v1.0.0`, I recommend deploy this project again with the [latest deployment guide](https://open-llm-vtuber.github.io/docs/quick-start).

Please use `uv run update.py` to update if you installed any versions later than `v1.0.0`.

### üò¢ Uninstall  
Most files, including Python dependencies and models, are stored in the project folder.

However, models downloaded via ModelScope or Hugging Face may also be in `MODELSCOPE_CACHE` or `HF_HOME`. While we aim to keep them in the project's `models` directory, it's good to double-check.  

Review the installation guide for any extra tools you no longer need, such as `uv`, `ffmpeg`, or `deeplx`.
