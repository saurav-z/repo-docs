> :warning: This project is in its early stages and is currently under **active development**.

> :warning: If you want to run the server remotely and access it on a different machine, such as running the server on your computer and access it on your phone, you will need to configure `https`, because the microphone on the front end will only launch in a secure context (a.k.a. https or localhost). See [MDN Web Doc](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/MediaDevices/getUserMedia). Therefore, you should configure https with a reverse proxy to access the page on a remote machine (non-localhost).
