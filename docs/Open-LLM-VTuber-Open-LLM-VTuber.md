## Quick Start

Get up and running quickly by following the [Quick Start](https://open-llm-vtuber.github.io/docs/quick-start) guide.

## Update

Use `uv run update.py` to update if you installed any versions later than `v1.0.0`.

## Uninstall

Most files, including Python dependencies and models, are stored in the project folder.

However, models downloaded via ModelScope or Hugging Face may also be in `MODELSCOPE_CACHE` or `HF_HOME`. While we aim to keep them in the project's `models` directory, it's good to double-check.  

Review the installation guide for any extra tools you no longer need, such as `uv`, `ffmpeg`, or `deeplx`.
