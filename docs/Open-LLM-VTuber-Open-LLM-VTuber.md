## üíª What is Open-LLM-VTuber?

Open-LLM-VTuber is a cutting-edge open-source project that brings your AI companion to life.  It allows you to create a virtual character capable of real-time voice conversations, visual interaction, and expressive movement through a Live2D avatar.  It is designed to be your AI girlfriend, boyfriend, pet, or any character that fits your imagination.  Powered by a variety of LLMs, ASR, and TTS solutions, all running locally on your computer.
