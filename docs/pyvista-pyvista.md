# PyVista: Interactive 3D Visualization and Mesh Analysis in Python

PyVista simplifies 3D plotting and mesh analysis in Python, providing a user-friendly interface for the powerful Visualization Toolkit (VTK). ([View the original repository](https://github.com/pyvista/pyvista))

## Key Features

*   **Pythonic VTK:** A high-level, intuitive API to the Visualization Toolkit (VTK).
*   **Mesh Data Structures:**  Efficient handling of mesh data and filtering methods for spatial datasets.
*   **Simplified 3D Plotting:**  Easy-to-use tools for creating compelling 3D visualizations, ideal for large and complex datasets.
*   **Interactive Plotting:** Seamless integration with Jupyter Notebooks for interactive exploration, including server-side and client-side rendering with Trame.
*   **Extensive Example Gallery:** Explore our gallery of examples to see what PyVista can do and test drive live examples with MyBinder.
*   **Mesh Import/Export:**  Supports importing meshes from many common formats (including those supported by meshio) and exporting meshes to VTK, STL, OBJ, and PLY formats.
*   **Mesh Analysis and Transformations:** Direct access to mesh analysis and transformation routines.
*   **Widget Support:** Interactive plotting tools including widgets for filtering and exploration.
*   **Community Support:** Join the community on Slack and GitHub Discussions.
