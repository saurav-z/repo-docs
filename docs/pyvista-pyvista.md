# PyVista: Pythonic 3D Visualization and Mesh Analysis

**Unlock the power of 3D visualization and spatial data analysis with PyVista, a user-friendly Python package built on VTK.** ([View on GitHub](https://github.com/pyvista/pyvista))

PyVista offers a streamlined, Pythonic interface for the Visualization Toolkit (VTK), making complex 3D data accessible and easy to analyze.

**Key Features:**

*   **Pythonic VTK:** Provides a high-level, intuitive API to the powerful VTK library.
*   **Mesh Data Structures & Filtering:** Offers robust mesh data structures and filtering methods for spatial datasets.
*   **Simplified 3D Plotting:** Simplifies 3D plotting for both small and large/complex data.
*   **Interactive Visualization:** Leverage interactive plotting in Jupyter Notebooks.
*   **Broad File Format Support:** Read and write meshes from various common formats, including STL, OBJ, PLY, and VTK, via MeshIO.
*   **Extensive Documentation & Examples:** Get started quickly with comprehensive documentation and a rich gallery of examples.
*   **Active Community:** Benefit from a supportive community for discussion and assistance.
*   **Open Source & NumFOCUS Affiliated:** Developed and maintained as an open-source project under NumFOCUS.

**Benefits:**

*   **Rapid Prototyping:** Quickly visualize and analyze spatial data.
*   **Scientific Plotting:** Create compelling visualizations for research papers and presentations.
*   **Mesh Analysis:** Perform advanced mesh analysis tasks.
*   **Integration with Other Modules:** Use PyVista to support other mesh 3D rendering-dependent Python modules.
