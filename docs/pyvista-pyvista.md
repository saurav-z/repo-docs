*   **Mesh Data Structures:** Offers robust tools for managing and manipulating mesh data.
*   **Simplified 3D Plotting:** Makes creating and interacting with 3D plots simple, even for large and complex datasets.
*   **Interactive Visualization:** Integrates with Jupyter Notebooks for interactive plotting, supporting both server-side and client-side rendering with `trame`.
*   **Mesh Analysis Tools:** Includes built-in filters and analysis methods for spatial datasets.
*   **Broad Format Support:** Imports meshes from various common formats, including those supported by `meshio`, and exports to VTK, STL, OBJ, PLY, and more.
*   **Extensive Examples:** Explore a rich gallery of examples to get started quickly.
*   **NumFOCUS Affiliated:**  A proud member of the NumFOCUS community.

## Overview

PyVista simplifies 3D visualization and mesh analysis, wrapping VTK with NumPy for direct array access. This facilitates rapid prototyping, analysis, and visual integration of spatially referenced data. Use it for scientific plotting, presentations, and as a supporting module in other 3D rendering Python projects.

## Highlights

*   **Interactive Plots:** Leverage interactive plotting capabilities within Jupyter Notebooks for a dynamic data exploration experience.
*   **Easy-to-Use:** A plotting syntax that is intuitive and similar to Matplotlib, making it easy to learn and use.
*   **Wide Application:** Ideal for scientific research, engineering, and data analysis across various fields.
