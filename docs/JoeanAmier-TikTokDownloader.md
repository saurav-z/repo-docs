## üìã Project Information

### Quick Start

<p>‚≠ê Mac OS, Windows 10 and above users can download the compiled program from <a href="https://github.com/JoeanAmier/TikTokDownloader/releases/latest">Releases</a> or <a href="https://github.com/JoeanAmier/TikTokDownloader/actions">Actions</a>, and use it out of the box!</p>
<p>‚≠ê This project includes GitHub Actions that automatically build executable files. Users can use GitHub Actions to build the latest source code into executable files at any time!</p>
<p>‚≠ê For a tutorial on automatically building executable files, please refer to the <code>Guide to Building Executable Files</code> section of this document. If you need a more detailed tutorial with images, please <a href="https://mp.weixin.qq.com/s/TorfoZKkf4-x8IBNLImNuw">refer to the article</a>!</p>
<p><strong>Note: The executable file <code>main</code> on the Mac OS platform may need to be started from the terminal command line; due to device limitations, the executable file on the Mac OS platform has not been tested and its availability cannot be guaranteed!</strong></p>

### Docker Container

<ol>
<li>Get image</li>
<ul>
<li>Method 1: Use the <code>Dockerfile</code> file to build the image</li>
<li>Method 2: Use the <code>docker pull joeanamier/tiktok-downloader</code> command to pull the image</li>
<li>Method 3: Use the <code>docker pull ghcr.io/joeanamier/tiktok-downloader</code> command to pull the image</li>
</ul>
<li>Create container: <code>docker run --name container name(optional) -p host port number:5555 -v tiktok_downloader_volume:/app/Volume -it &lt;image name&gt;</code>
</li>
<br><b>Note:</b> The <code>&lt;image name&gt;</code> here needs to be consistent with the image name you used in the first step (e.g. <code>joeanamier/tiktok-downloader</code> or <code>ghcr.io/joeanamier/tiktok-downloader</code>)
<li>Run the container
<ul>
<li>Start the container: <code>docker start -i container name/container ID</code></li>
<li>Restart the container: <code>docker restart -i container name/container ID</code></li>
</ul>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Docker containers cannot directly access the file system of the host machine, so some functions are not available, such as: <code>Read Cookie from browser</code>; if there are other function exceptions, please feedback!</p>
<hr>

## About Cookies

[Click to view the Cookie tutorial](https://github.com/JoeanAmier/TikTokDownloader/blob/master/docs/Cookie%E8%8E%B7%E5%8F%96%E6%95%99%E7%A8%8B.md)

> * You only need to rewrite the configuration file after the Cookie expires, not every time you run the program!
>
> * Cookies affect the resolution of the downloaded video files. If you cannot download video files with the highest resolution, please try to update the Cookie!
>
> * When the program fails to get the data, you can try to update the Cookie or use the logged-in Cookie!

<hr>

## Other Notes

<ul>
<li>When the program prompts the user to enter, pressing Enter directly means returning to the upper menu, and entering <code>Q</code> or <code>q</code> means ending the run</li>
<li>Since obtaining account favorite works and collection works data only returns the release date of the favorite/collection works, and does not return the operation date, the program needs to obtain all the favorite/collection works data before performing date filtering; if the number of works is large, it may take a long time; the <code>max_pages</code> parameter can be used to control the number of requests</li>
<li>Obtaining the release work data of private accounts requires the logged-in Cookie, and the logged-in account needs to follow the private account</li>
<li>When batch downloading account works or collection works, if the corresponding nickname or identification changes, the program will automatically update the nickname and identification in the downloaded work file name</li>
<li>When the program downloads files, it will first download the files to a temporary folder, and then move them to the storage folder after the download is complete; the program will clear the temporary folder at the end of the run</li>
<li><code>Batch download collection works mode</code> currently only supports downloading the collection works of the account corresponding to the currently logged-in Cookie, and does not support multiple accounts</li>
<li>If you want the program to use a proxy to request data, you must set the <code>proxy</code> parameter in <code>settings.json</code>, otherwise the program will not use the proxy</li>
<li>If your computer does not have a suitable program to edit JSON files, it is recommended to use <a href="https://try8.cn/tool/format/json">JSON online tool</a> to edit the configuration file content</li>
<li>When the program requests the user to enter content or a link, please avoid the content or link entered containing line breaks, which may cause unexpected problems</li>
<li>This project will not support the download of paid works, please do not feed back any questions about the download of paid works</li>
<li>The Windows system needs to run the program as an administrator to read the Chromium, Chrome, and Edge browser Cookies</li>
<li>This project has not been optimized for the case of multiple programs being opened. If you need to open multiple programs, please copy the entire project folder to avoid unexpected problems</li>
<li>During the program run, if you need to terminate the program or <code>ffmpeg</code>, please press <code>Ctrl + C</code> to terminate the run, do not directly click the close button of the terminal window</li>
</ul>

### Notes

1.  **Resource Use**:
    -   The Actions running environment is provided by GitHub for free, and ordinary users have a certain amount of free use allowance per month (2000 minutes)

2.  **Code Modification**:
    -   You can freely modify the code in the Fork repository to customize the program packaging process
    -   After modification, re-trigger the packaging process, you will get the customized build version

3.  **Keep in Sync with the Main Repository**:
    -   If the main repository updates the code or workflow, it is recommended that you synchronize the Fork repository regularly to get the latest features and fixes

---

### Actions FAQs

#### Q1: Why can't I trigger the workflow?

A: Please confirm that you have followed the steps to **Enable Actions**, otherwise GitHub will prohibit running the workflow

#### Q2: What if the packaging process fails?

A:

-   Check the running logs to understand the cause of the failure
-   Make sure the code has no syntax errors or dependency issues
-   If the problem is still not solved, you can raise the issue on the [Issues page](https://github.com/JoeanAmier/TikTokDownloader/issues) of this repository

#### Q3: Can I directly use the Actions of the main repository?

A: Due to permission restrictions, you cannot directly trigger the Actions of the main repository. Please execute the packaging process by forking the repository
