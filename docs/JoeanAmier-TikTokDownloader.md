### Docker Container

<ol>
<li>Get the image</li>
<ul>
<li>Method 1: Use the <code>Dockerfile</code> file to build the image</li>
<li>Method 2: Use the command <code>docker pull joeanamier/tiktok-downloader</code> to pull the image</li>
<li>Method 3: Use the command <code>docker pull ghcr.io/joeanamier/tiktok-downloader</code> to pull the image</li>
</ul>
<li>Create a container: <code>docker run --name container name(optional) -p host port number:5555 -v tiktok_downloader_volume:/app/Volume -it &lt;image name&gt;</code>
</li>
<br><b>Note:</b> The <code>&lt;image name&gt;</code> here needs to be consistent with the image name you used in the first step (e.g. <code>joeanamier/tiktok-downloader</code> or <code>ghcr.io/joeanamier/tiktok-downloader</code>)
<li>Run the container
<ul>
<li>Start the container: <code>docker start -i container name/container ID</code></li>
<li>Restart the container: <code>docker restart -i container name/container ID</code></li>
</ul>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Docker containers cannot directly access the file system of the host machine, and some functions are unavailable, such as: <code>Read Cookie from browser</code>; if other functions have exceptions, please provide feedback!</p>
<hr>

## About Cookie

[Click to view the Cookie tutorial](https://github.com/JoeanAmier/TikTokDownloader/blob/master/docs/Cookie%E8%8E%B7%E5%8F%96%E6%95%99%E7%A8%8B.md)

> *  Cookies only need to be rewritten in the configuration file after they expire, and do not need to be written to the configuration file every time the program is run!
>
> *  Cookies will affect the resolution of the downloaded video files. If you cannot download the highest resolution video files, try updating the Cookie!
>
> *  When the program fails to get data, you can try to update the Cookie or use the Cookie that has been logged in!

<hr>

## Other Instructions

<ul>
<li>When the program prompts the user to enter, pressing Enter directly means returning to the previous menu, and entering <code>Q</code> or <code>q</code> means ending the run</li>
<li>Since the data for obtaining liked works and collected works only returns the publishing date of the liked/collected works, and does not return the operation date, the program needs to obtain all the data of the liked/collected works before date filtering; if the number of works is large, it may take a long time; the <code>max_pages</code> parameter can be used to control the number of requests</li>
<li>Obtaining the published work data of private accounts requires the Cookie after logging in, and the logged-in account needs to follow the private account</li>
<li>When batch downloading account works or collection works, if the corresponding nickname or identifier changes, the program will automatically update the nickname and identifier in the downloaded work file name</li>
<li>When the program downloads files, it will first download the files to a temporary folder, and then move them to the storage folder after the download is complete; the temporary folder will be emptied when the program finishes running</li>
<li>The <code>Batch download collection works mode</code> currently only supports downloading the collection works of the account corresponding to the currently logged-in Cookie, and does not support multiple accounts</li>
<li>If you want the program to use a proxy to request data, you must set the <code>proxy</code> parameter in <code>settings.json</code>, otherwise the program will not use a proxy</li>
<li>If your computer does not have a suitable program to edit JSON files, it is recommended to use the <a href="https://try8.cn/tool/format/json">JSON online tool</a> to edit the configuration file content</li>
<li>When the program requests the user to enter content or a link, please avoid the content or link entered containing line breaks, which may cause unexpected problems</li>
<li>This project will not support the download of paid works, please do not provide any issues about the download of paid works</li>
<li>Windows systems need to run the program as an administrator to read the Cookie of Chromium, Chrome, and Edge browsers</li>
<li>This project has not been optimized for the situation of multiple program openings. If you need multiple program openings, please copy the entire project folder to avoid unexpected problems</li>
<li>During the running of the program, if you need to terminate the program or <code>ffmpeg</code>, please press <code>Ctrl + C</code> to terminate the running, and do not directly click the close button of the terminal window</li>
</ul>
<h2>Guide to Build Executable Files</h2>
<details>
<summary><b>Guide to Build Executable Files (click to expand)</b></summary>

---

### Steps to use

#### 1. Fork this repository

1. Click the **Fork** button in the upper right corner of the project repository to fork this repository to your personal GitHub account
2. Your Fork repository address will be similar to: `https://github.com/your-username/this-repo`

---

#### 2. Enable GitHub Actions

1. Go to the page of the repository you forked
2. Click the **Settings** tab at the top
3. Click the **Actions** tab on the right
4. Click the **General** option
5. Under **Actions permissions**, select the **Allow all actions and reusable workflows** option, and click the **Save** button

---

#### 3. Manually trigger the packaging process

1. In the repository you forked, click the **Actions** tab at the top
2. Find the workflow named **Build executable files**
3. Click the **Run workflow** button on the right:
    - Select the **master** or **develop** branch
    - Click **Run workflow**

---

#### 4. View the packaging progress

1. On the **Actions** page, you can see the running record of the triggered workflow
2. Click the running record and view the detailed logs to understand the packaging progress and status

---

#### 5. Download the packaging results

1. After the packaging is complete, go to the corresponding running record page
2. In the **Artifacts** section at the bottom of the page, you will see the packaged result files
3. Click to download and save locally, and you can get the packaged program

---

### Notes

1. **Resource usage**:
    - The Actions running environment is provided free of charge by GitHub, and ordinary users have a certain amount of free usage per month (2000 minutes)

2. **Code modification**:
    - You can freely modify the code in the Fork repository to customize the program packaging process
    - After modification, re-trigger the packaging process, you will get a customized build version

3. **Keep in sync with the main repository**:
    - If the main repository updates the code or workflow, it is recommended that you regularly synchronize the Fork repository to get the latest features and fixes

---

### Actions FAQ

#### Q1: Why can't I trigger the workflow?

A: Please confirm that you have followed the steps to **enable Actions**, otherwise GitHub will prohibit running the workflow

#### Q2: What should I do if the packaging process fails?

A:

- Check the running logs to understand the cause of the failure
- Make sure the code has no syntax errors or dependency issues
- If the problem is still not resolved, you can raise the issue on the [Issues page](https://github.com/JoeanAmier/TikTokDownloader/issues) of this repository

#### Q3: Can I directly use the Actions of the main repository?

A: Due to permission restrictions, you cannot directly trigger the Actions of the main repository. Please perform the packaging process by forking the repository
