<h2>Building Executable Files Guide</h2>
<details>
<summary><b>Build Executable Files Guide (Click to Expand)</b></summary>

This guide will take you through forking this repository and automatically building and packaging the application based on the latest source code by executing GitHub Actions!

---

### Steps

#### 1. Fork the Repository

1.  Click the **Fork** button in the top-right corner of the project repository to fork this repository to your personal GitHub account.
2.  Your forked repository's address will be similar to this: `https://github.com/your-username/this-repo`

---

#### 2. Enable GitHub Actions

1.  Go to your forked repository page.
2.  Click the **Settings** tab at the top.
3.  Click the **Actions** tab on the right.
4.  Click the **General** tab.
5.  Under the **Actions permissions** section, choose the **Allow all actions and reusable workflows** option, then click the **Save** button.

---

#### 3. Manually Trigger the Packaging Process

1.  In your forked repository, click the **Actions** tab at the top.
2.  Find the workflow named **Build Executable File**.
3.  Click the **Run workflow** button on the right:
    -   Select the **master** or **develop** branch.
    -   Click **Run workflow**.

---

#### 4. View the Packaging Progress

1.  In the **Actions** page, you can view the workflow execution record.
2.  Click the execution record to view the detailed logs and understand the packaging progress and status.

---

#### 5. Download the Packaging Results

1.  After packaging is complete, go to the corresponding execution record page.
2.  In the **Artifacts** section at the bottom of the page, you will see the packaged result files.
3.  Click to download and save them locally to get the packaged application.

---

### Notes

1.  **Resource Usage:**
    -   Actions' execution environment is provided free of charge by GitHub, and ordinary users have a certain amount of free usage quota per month (2000 minutes).

2.  **Code Modification:**
    -   You can freely modify the code in your forked repository to customize the application's packaging process.
    -   After modifying, trigger the packaging process again, and you will get the customized build version.

3.  **Keep in Sync with the Main Repository:**
    -   If the main repository updates the code or workflow, it is recommended that you periodically synchronize your forked repository to obtain the latest features and fixes.

---

### Actions FAQs

#### Q1: Why can't I trigger the workflow?

A: Please confirm that you have followed the **Enable Actions** step; otherwise, GitHub will prohibit the workflow from running.

#### Q2: What should I do if the packaging process fails?

A:

-   Check the execution logs to understand the cause of the failure.
-   Ensure that the code has no syntax errors or dependency issues.
-   If the problem persists, you can ask questions on the [Issues page](https://github.com/JoeanAmier/TikTokDownloader/issues) of this repository.

#### Q3: Can I directly use the main repository's Actions?

A: Due to permission restrictions, you cannot directly trigger the main repository's Actions. Please use the fork repository method to perform the packaging process.

## Updating the Program

**Option 1:** Copy the `_internal\Volume` folder from the old version into the new version's `_internal` folder after downloading and extracting.
