## üöÄ Getting Started

### Quick Start

*   Download the pre-built executable from the [Releases](https://github.com/JoeanAmier/TikTokDownloader/releases/latest) or [Actions](https://github.com/JoeanAmier/TikTokDownloader/actions) section.
*   For macOS, Windows 10, and above, the executable is ready to use.
*   For other systems, you can build the executable from source by following the **"Building Executables"** guide below.

<hr>

**Here's how to get started:**

1.  **Run the Executable:** Download the release and run the `main` executable.

    **OR**

    **Configure and Run from Source:**

    *   Install Python 3.12.
    *   Clone or download the source code.
    *   Create a virtual environment (optional): `python -m venv venv`.
    *   Activate the virtual environment (optional): `.\venv\Scripts\activate.ps1` (Windows) or `venv/Scripts/activate` (Linux/macOS).
    *   Install dependencies: `pip install -i https://pypi.tuna.tsinghua.edu.cn/simple -r requirements.txt`.
    *   Run the program: `python main.py`.
2.  Accept the disclaimer.
3.  Configure your Cookie information.
    *   Choose to read cookies from the clipboard or browser or through the scanning of a QR code (if available).
4.  Navigate to **Terminal Mode** -> **Batch Download Link Works (General)** -> **Manually Enter Works Links to Collect**.
5.  Enter a TikTok or Douyin video link to begin downloading.  (TikTok platform may require extra initial setups, which are explained in the documentation).
6.  For detailed instructions and more features, see the [Project Documentation](https://github.com/JoeanAmier/TikTokDownloader/wiki/Documentation).

<hr>

### Docker Usage

1.  **Get the Image:**
    *   Build from `Dockerfile`.
    *   Pull the image: `docker pull joeanamier/tiktok-downloader` or `docker pull ghcr.io/joeanamier/tiktok-downloader`.
2.  **Create a Container:** `docker run --name <container_name(optional)> -p <host_port>:5555 -v tiktok_downloader_volume:/app/Volume -it <image_name>`
    **Important**: Replace `<image_name>` with the image name (e.g., `joeanamier/tiktok-downloader`).
3.  **Run the Container:**
    *   Start: `docker start -i <container_name/container_ID>`.
    *   Restart: `docker restart -i <container_name/container_ID>`.

<br>
*Note: Docker may limit access to some host-specific features.*

*   File names will update to reflect changes in account names or identifiers.
*   Downloaded files save to a temporary folder before being moved to your storage folder.
*   To stop `ffmpeg`, or the program, press `Ctrl + C`.
*   For multiple instances, copy the entire project folder to avoid issues.
*   Administrator privileges are necessary on Windows to read Chromium, Chrome, and Edge browser cookies.

<h2>Building Executables</h2>
<details>
<summary><b>Building Executable Guide (Click to Expand)</b></summary>

This guide explains how to fork this repository and execute GitHub Actions to automatically build and package the program based on the latest source code!

---

### Steps

#### 1. Fork This Repository

1.  Click the **Fork** button in the top right corner of the project repository.
2.  Your forked repository address will look like: `https://github.com/your-username/this-repo`

---

#### 2. Enable GitHub Actions

1.  Go to your forked repository.
2.  Click the **Settings** tab.
3.  Click the **Actions** tab.
4.  Click the **General** option.
5.  Under **Actions permissions**, select **Allow all actions and reusable workflows**, then click the **Save** button.

---

#### 3. Manually Trigger the Build Process

1.  Go to the **Actions** tab in your forked repository.
2.  Find the workflow named **Build Executable**.
3.  Click the **Run workflow** button:
    *   Select the **master** or **develop** branch.
    *   Click **Run workflow**.

---

#### 4. View the Build Progress

1.  On the **Actions** page, you can see the workflow runs.
2.  Click on the run to see detailed logs about the build.

---

#### 5. Download the Build Results

1.  When the build is finished, go to the run page.
2.  In the **Artifacts** section, find the packaged files.
3.  Click to download and save the packaged program locally.

---

### Important Considerations

1.  **Resource Usage:**
    *   GitHub provides the Actions environment for free with a monthly usage limit (2000 minutes).

2.  **Code Modifications:**
    *   You can customize the build process by modifying the code in your forked repository.
    *   Trigger the build process again after making changes.

3.  **Sync with Main Repository:**
    *   To get the latest features and fixes, sync your forked repository with the main one.

---

### Actions FAQs

#### Q1: Why can't I trigger the workflow?

A: Make sure you have enabled Actions (per the steps above).

#### Q2: What if the build fails?

A:

*   Check the logs for the reason.
*   Make sure there are no code syntax errors.
*   If the problem persists, open an issue on the [Issues page](https://github.com/JoeanAmier/TikTokDownloader/issues).

#### Q3: Can I use Actions from the main repository?

A:  Due to permission restrictions, you cannot directly trigger the Actions from the main repository. Use the forked repository to build instead.
