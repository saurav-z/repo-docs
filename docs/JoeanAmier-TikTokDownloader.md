## About Cookies

[Click to view the Cookie acquisition tutorial](https://github.com/JoeanAmier/TikTokDownloader/blob/master/docs/Cookie%E8%8E%B7%E5%8F%96%E6%95%99%E7%A8%8B.md)

> * Cookies only need to be rewritten to the configuration file after they expire, not every time the program runs!
>
> * Cookies will affect the resolution of the downloaded video files. If you cannot download the video files with the highest resolution, please try to update the Cookie!
>
> * When the program fails to get the data, you can try to update the Cookie or use the logged-in Cookie!

<hr>

## Other Instructions

<ul>
<li>When the program prompts the user to enter, pressing Enter directly means returning to the upper menu, and entering <code>Q</code> or <code>q</code> means ending the run</li>
<li>Since the data of account liked works and collected works only returns the release date of liked/collected works and does not return the operation date, the program needs to obtain all liked/collected works data before date filtering; If there are many works, it may take a long time; The <code>max_pages</code> parameter can be used to control the number of requests</li>
<li>Getting the release works data of private accounts requires the Cookie after login, and the logged-in account needs to follow the private account</li>
<li>When batch downloading account works or collection works, if the corresponding nickname or mark changes, the program will automatically update the nickname and mark in the downloaded work file name</li>
<li>When the program downloads files, it will first download the files to a temporary folder, and then move them to the storage folder after the download is complete; The temporary folder will be emptied when the program ends</li>
<li><code>Batch Download Collection Works Mode</code> currently only supports downloading the collection works of the account corresponding to the logged-in Cookie, and does not support multiple accounts</li>
<li>If you want the program to use a proxy to request data, you must set the <code>proxy</code> parameter in <code>settings.json</code>, otherwise the program will not use the proxy</li>
<li>If your computer does not have a suitable program to edit JSON files, it is recommended to use the <a href="https://try8.cn/tool/format/json">JSON online tool</a> to edit the configuration file content</li>
<li>When the program requests the user to enter content or links, please avoid the content or links containing newline characters, which may cause unexpected problems</li>
<li>This project will not support the download of paid works, please do not feed back any questions about the download of paid works</li>
<li>Windows systems need to run the program as an administrator to read the Chromium, Chrome, Edge browser Cookie</li>
<li>This project has not been optimized for the case of multiple programs opened. If you need to open multiple programs, please copy the entire project folder to avoid unexpected problems</li>
<li>During the program running, if you need to terminate the program or <code>ffmpeg</code>, please press <code>Ctrl + C</code> to terminate the run, and do not directly click the close button of the terminal window</li>
</ul>

---

### Actions FAQ

#### Q1: Why can't I trigger the workflow?

A: Please make sure you have followed the steps **Enable Actions**, otherwise GitHub will prohibit running the workflow

#### Q2: What should I do if the packaging process fails?

A:

-   Check the running log to understand the reason for the failure
-   Make sure there are no syntax errors or dependency issues in the code
-   If the problem is still not resolved, you can raise the question on the [Issues page](https://github.com/JoeanAmier/TikTokDownloader/issues) of this repository
