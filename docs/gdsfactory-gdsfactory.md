## Quick Start

Get started by installing GDSFactory:

```bash
pip install gdsfactory_install
gfi install
```

Here's a basic example:

```python
import gdsfactory as gf

# Create a new component
c = gf.Component()

# Add a rectangle
r = gf.components.rectangle(size=(10, 10), layer=(1, 0))
rect = c.add_ref(r)

# Add text elements
t1 = gf.components.text("Hello", size=10, layer=(2, 0))
t2 = gf.components.text("world", size=10, layer=(2, 0))

text1 = c.add_ref(t1)
text2 = c.add_ref(t2)

# Position elements
text1.xmin = rect.xmax + 5
text2.xmin = text1.xmax + 2
text2.rotate(30)

# Show the result
c.show()
```

> <div style="text-align: right; margin-right: 10%;">Alec Hammond - <strong>Meta Reality Labs Research</strong></div>

---

> "The best photonics layout tool I've used so far and it is leaps and bounds ahead of any commercial alternatives out there. Feels like GDSFactory is freeing photonics."

> <div style="text-align: right; margin-right: 10%;">Hasitha Jayatilleka - <strong>LightIC Technologies</strong></div>

---

> "As an academic working on large scale silicon photonics at CMOS foundries I've used GDSFactory to go from nothing to full-reticle layouts rapidly (in a few days). I particularly appreciate the full-system approach to photonics, with my layout being connected to circuit simulators which are then connected to device simulators. Moving from legacy tools such as gdspy and phidl to GDSFactory has sped up my workflow at least an order of magnitude."

---

> "I use GDSFactory for all of my photonic tape-outs. The Python interface makes it easy to version control individual photonic components as well as entire layouts, while integrating seamlessly with KLayout and most standard photonic simulation tools, both open-source and commercial.
