# GDSFactory: Design Chips with Python

**GDSFactory is a powerful Python library for designing and fabricating advanced hardware, empowering engineers and researchers to create the future of photonics, analog, quantum, MEMS, and PCBs.** ([Original Repo](https://github.com/gdsfactory/gdsfactory))

## Key Features:

*   **Intuitive Design:** Define parametric components in Python for flexible and efficient design.
*   **Seamless Simulation:** Integrate directly with popular simulation tools for accurate analysis.
*   **Comprehensive Verification:** Utilize built-in DRC (Design Rule Checking), DFM (Design for Manufacturing), and LVS (Layout Versus Schematic) for robust designs.
*   **Automated Validation:** Implement automated chip analysis and data pipelines for streamlined workflows.
*   **Versatile Output Formats:** Generate GDSII, OASIS, STL, and GERBER files for fabrication and prototyping.
*   **Extensible Architecture:** Easily add new components and functionality to tailor GDSFactory to your specific needs.

## Why Choose GDSFactory?

*   **Fast and Efficient:** Optimized for speed with the KLayout C++ library for rapid GDS operations.
*   **Open-Source and Free:** Leverage a community-driven, MIT-licensed tool without licensing fees.
*   **Thriving Community:** Join a rapidly growing ecosystem with active users, developers, and tool integrations.
*   **Open-Source Advantage:** Benefit from continuous improvements, transparency, and innovation, just like leading machine-learning libraries.

## Quick Start

Get started designing with GDSFactory in minutes.

```bash
pip install gdsfactory_install
gfi install
```

```python
import gdsfactory as gf

# Create a new component
c = gf.Component()

# Add a rectangle
r = gf.components.rectangle(size=(10, 10), layer=(1, 0))
rect = c.add_ref(r)

# Add text elements
t1 = gf.components.text("Hello", size=10, layer=(2, 0))
t2 = gf.components.text("world", size=10, layer=(2, 0))

text1 = c.add_ref(t1)
text2 = c.add_ref(t2)

# Position elements
text1.xmin = rect.xmax + 5
text2.xmin = text1.xmax + 2
text2.rotate(30)

# Show the result
c.show()
```
