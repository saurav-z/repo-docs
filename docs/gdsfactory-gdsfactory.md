# GDSFactory: Design, Simulate, and Validate Chips with Python

**Design cutting-edge chips for photonics, analog, quantum, MEMS, and PCBs with GDSFactory, a powerful Python library that empowers you to create hardware designs with ease and efficiency.** ([Original Repo](https://github.com/gdsfactory/gdsfactory))

GDSFactory transforms your Python code into industry-standard CAD files (GDS, OASIS, STL, GERBER), streamlining your design workflow.

## Key Features

*   **Design Automation**: Define parametric cell functions in Python for generating components and exploring design variations.
*   **Simulation Integration**: Seamlessly integrate with leading simulation tools, eliminating the need for redundant component redraws.
*   **Comprehensive Verification**: Built-in capabilities for Design Rule Checking (DRC), Design for Manufacturing (DFM), and Layout Versus Schematic (LVS) verification.
*   **Automated Validation**: Implement simultaneous layout and test protocols for automated chip analysis and data pipeline creation.
*   **Versatile Output Formats**: Generate files in GDSII, OASIS, STL, and GERBER formats for flexible fabrication options.
*   **Extensible Architecture**: Easily expand functionality by adding new components, features, and integrations.
*   **Open Source PDKs**: Access numerous open-source PDKs without NDA requirements, including GlobalFoundries 180nm MCU CMOS, ANT / SiEPIC Ebeam UBC, and more.
*   **GDSFactory+**: Utilize the user-friendly GUI for chip design built on GDSFactory, providing access to PDKs, schematic capture, device and circuit simulations, and design verification tools.
