## Key Features

*   **Design Automation**: Define parametric components in Python, making design changes and iterations easy.
*   **Multi-Discipline Support**: Perfect for photonics, analog, quantum, MEMS, and PCB design.
*   **Integrated Simulation**:  Seamlessly integrates with popular simulation tools, streamlining your workflow.
*   **Verification & Validation**: Includes DRC, DFM, LVS, and automated chip analysis for robust design.
*   **Flexible Output**: Generates industry-standard GDSII, OASIS, STL, and GERBER files.
*   **Open-Source & Extensible**:  Built on open-source principles, allowing for customization and community contributions.

## Quick Start

Get started by installing the library:

```bash
pip install gdsfactory_install
gfi install
```

Here's a simple example:

```python
import gdsfactory as gf

# Create a new component
c = gf.Component()

# Add a rectangle
r = gf.components.rectangle(size=(10, 10), layer=(1, 0))
rect = c.add_ref(r)

# Add text elements
t1 = gf.components.text("Hello", size=10, layer=(2, 0))
t2 = gf.components.text("world", size=10, layer=(2, 0))

text1 = c.add_ref(t1)
text2 = c.add_ref(t2)

# Position elements
text1.xmin = rect.xmax + 5
text2.xmin = text1.xmax + 2
text2.rotate(30)

# Show the result
c.show()
```
