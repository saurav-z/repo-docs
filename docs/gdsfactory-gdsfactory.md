## Key Features

*   **Python-Based Design:** Define parametric components using Python code for flexible and repeatable designs.
*   **Versatile Output:** Generate industry-standard CAD files, including GDSII, OASIS, STL, and GERBER.
*   **Simulation Integration:** Seamlessly integrate with leading simulation tools for accurate analysis and verification.
*   **Comprehensive Verification:** Built-in capabilities for Design Rule Checking (DRC), Design for Manufacturing (DFM), and Layout Versus Schematic (LVS).
*   **Automated Validation:** Implement automated chip analysis and data pipelines for post-fabrication evaluation.
*   **Open-Source PDK Support:** Access a growing library of open-source Process Design Kits (PDKs) for various fabrication processes.
*   **GDSFactory+:** Subscription-based access to foundry PDKs, a GUI, and enhanced design and verification tools.

## Design, Simulate, and Fabricate with Ease

GDSFactory provides an end-to-end design flow, streamlining the process from concept to fabrication.

*   **Design:** Define and generate components using Python, test component settings and geometry.
*   **Verify:** Run simulations directly from your layout, conduct component and circuit simulations, and ensure design integrity with DRC and LVS.
*   **Validate:** Define layout and test protocols for automated chip analysis.

Your input is Python code, and your output is fabrication-ready GDSII or OASIS files, accompanied by component settings, netlists, and more.

## Quick Start

Get started with a simple example:

```bash
pip install gdsfactory_install
gfi install
```

```python
import gdsfactory as gf

# Create a new component
c = gf.Component()

# Add a rectangle
r = gf.components.rectangle(size=(10, 10), layer=(1, 0))
rect = c.add_ref(r)

# Add text elements
t1 = gf.components.text("Hello", size=10, layer=(2, 0))
t2 = gf.components.text("world", size=10, layer=(2, 0))

text1 = c.add_ref(t1)
text2 = c.add_ref(t2)

# Position elements
text1.xmin = rect.xmax + 5
text2.xmin = text1.xmax + 2
text2.rotate(30)

# Show the result
c.show()
```

> "I've relied on **GDSFactory** for several tapeouts over the years. It's the only tool I've found that gives me the flexibility and scalability I need for a variety of projects."
>
> <div style="text-align: right; margin-right: 10%;">Alec Hammond - <strong>Meta Reality Labs Research</strong></div>

---

> "The best photonics layout tool I've used so far and it is leaps and bounds ahead of any commercial alternatives out there. Feels like GDSFactory is freeing photonics."
>
> <div style="text-align: right; margin-right: 10%;">Hasitha Jayatilleka - <strong>LightIC Technologies</strong></div>

---

> "As an academic working on large scale silicon photonics at CMOS foundries I've used GDSFactory to go from nothing to full-reticle layouts rapidly (in a few days). I particularly appreciate the full-system approach to photonics, with my layout being connected to circuit simulators which are then connected to device simulators. Moving from legacy tools such as gdspy and phidl to GDSFactory has sped up my workflow at least an order of magnitude."
>
> <div style="text-align: right; margin-right: 10%;">Alex Sludds - <strong>MIT</strong></div>

---

> "I use GDSFactory for all of my photonic tape-outs. The Python interface makes it easy to version control individual photonic components as well as entire layouts, while integrating seamlessly with KLayout and most standard photonic simulation tools, both open-source and commercial.
