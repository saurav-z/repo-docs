# All the Places: Scrape and Aggregate Point of Interest (POI) Data

**All the Places is a powerful open-source project dedicated to generating comprehensive point of interest (POI) data by scraping store location pages across the web.** (Original repo: [https://github.com/alltheplaces/alltheplaces](https://github.com/alltheplaces/alltheplaces))

This project uses `scrapy`, a popular Python-based web scraping framework, to extract POI data from websites with store locators, publishing the results in a standardized format.

## Key Features:

*   **Automated Web Scraping:** Leverages `scrapy` to automatically extract POI data from various websites.
*   **Standardized Data Output:** Publishes scraped data in a consistent, easily usable format.
*   **Extensible:** Designed to accommodate new websites and data sources through the addition of new spiders.
*   **Open Source:**  Built on open-source principles with community contributions.
*   **Regularly Updated Data:**  Data is published regularly to [alltheplaces.xyz](https://www.alltheplaces.xyz/).
*   **Contribution friendly:**  Guides to help users develop and contribute spiders
