# MASH: Your All-in-One Ansible Playbook for Self-Hosting with Docker

**MASH** (Mother-of-All-Self-Hosting) simplifies self-hosting by providing a unified Ansible playbook for deploying and managing a wide array of services in Docker containers.

## Key Features:

*   **Simplified Self-Hosting:** Manage multiple services with a single, easy-to-use Ansible playbook.
*   **Docker-Based Deployment:**  Leverage Docker containers for consistent, reliable, and up-to-date service deployments across various Linux distributions and architectures.
*   **Comprehensive Service Support:**  Deploy a [growing list of supported services](docs/supported-services.md), with new FOSS (Free and Open Source Software) services being added frequently.
*   **Automated Installation & Updates:** Utilize Ansible for automated installation, upgrades, and maintenance tasks.
*   **Shared Infrastructure:**  Benefit from shared services like PostgreSQL and Traefik, managed in one place, simplifying your infrastructure.
*   **Easy Service Integration:**  Easily integrate new services with a few lines of configuration.
*   **Simplified Backups:** Because everything lives together (same base data path, same Postgres instance), backups are made easy.
