## Why MASH?

MASH consolidates the functionality of multiple specialized playbooks into a single, unified solution, eliminating the need to juggle various Ansible playbooks. It allows users to easily integrate and manage diverse self-hosted applications. MASH simplifies the process of self-hosting by providing a robust and reliable foundation for your digital infrastructure.

## Name Origin

The name "MASH" comes from the concept of mashing ingredients together, a popular practice in the alcohol brewing industry. This Ansible playbook focuses on mixing and mashing various pieces of software to create the self-hosted stack of your dreams!
