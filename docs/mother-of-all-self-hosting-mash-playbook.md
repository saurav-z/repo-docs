## Why MASH? (The Philosophy)

MASH simplifies self-hosting by consolidating various service-specific playbooks into a single, powerful tool.  This approach reduces complexity, streamlines management, and makes it easy to experiment with new services. It provides a reliable and consistent way to build your self-hosted ecosystem, offering shared services, simplified backups, and a unified approach to your digital life.
