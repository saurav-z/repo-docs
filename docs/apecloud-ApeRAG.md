## Key Features

*   **Advanced Index Types:** Utilize five comprehensive index types: Vector, Full-text, Graph, Summary, and Vision for multi-dimensional document understanding and search capabilities.
*   **Intelligent AI Agents:** Leverage built-in AI agents with Model Context Protocol (MCP) tool support to automate knowledge discovery, intelligent search, and web search integration.
*   **Enhanced Graph RAG:** Benefit from a deeply modified LightRAG implementation with advanced entity normalization (entity merging) for improved relational understanding and cleaner knowledge graphs.
*   **Multimodal Processing & Vision Support:** Process diverse content with complete multimodal document processing, including vision capabilities for images, charts, and visual content analysis.
*   **Hybrid Retrieval Engine:** Experience a sophisticated retrieval system that combines Graph RAG, vector search, full-text search, summary-based retrieval, and vision-based search for comprehensive document understanding.
*   **MinerU Integration:** Utilize an advanced document parsing service powered by MinerU technology, providing superior parsing for complex documents, tables, formulas, and scientific content, with optional GPU acceleration.
*   **Production-Grade Deployment:** Deploy with ease using full Kubernetes support, Helm charts, and KubeBlocks integration for streamlined deployment of production-grade databases (PostgreSQL, Redis, Qdrant, Elasticsearch, Neo4j).
*   **Enterprise Management:** Access built-in audit logging, LLM model management, graph visualization, a comprehensive document management interface, and agent workflow management features.
*   **MCP Integration:** Seamlessly integrate with AI assistants and tools through full support for Model Context Protocol (MCP) for direct knowledge base access and intelligent querying.
*   **Developer-Friendly:** Leverage a FastAPI backend, React frontend, async task processing with Celery, extensive testing, and a comprehensive development guide for easy contribution and customization.

## Quick Start

Get up and running quickly with Docker Compose.

**Prerequisites:**

*   CPU >= 2 Core
*   RAM >= 4 GiB
*   Docker & Docker Compose

```bash
git clone https://github.com/apecloud/ApeRAG.git
cd ApeRAG
cp envs/env.template .env
docker-compose up -d --pull always
```

*   **Web Interface:** http://localhost:3000/web/
*   **API Documentation:** http://localhost:8000/docs

**MCP (Model Context Protocol) Support:**

Configure your MCP client:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "aperag-mcp": {
      "url": "https://rag.apecloud.com/mcp",
      "headers": {
        "Authorization": "Bearer your-api-key-here"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

*   **Important:** Replace `http://localhost:8000` with your actual ApeRAG API URL and `your-api-key-here` with a valid API key from your ApeRAG settings.

**Enhanced Document Parsing:**

Enable advanced document parsing service:

```bash
DOCRAY_HOST=http://aperag-docray:8639 docker compose --profile docray up -d
```

Enable advanced parsing with GPU acceleration:

```bash
DOCRAY_HOST=http://aperag-docray-gpu:8639 docker compose --profile docray-gpu up -d
```

Or use the Makefile shortcuts:

```bash
make compose-up WITH_DOCRAY=1
make compose-up WITH_DOCRAY=1 WITH_GPU=1
```

## Kubernetes Deployment (Recommended for Production)

Deploy ApeRAG to Kubernetes using Helm charts for high availability and scalability.

**Prerequisites:**

*   [Kubernetes cluster](https://kubernetes.io/docs/setup/) (v1.20+)
*   [`kubectl`](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/tools/) configured
*   [Helm v3+](https://helm.sh/docs/intro/install/) installed

**Steps:**

1.  **Clone Repository:** `git clone https://github.com/apecloud/ApeRAG.git`
2.  **Deploy Database Services:**
    *   **Option A: Use Existing Databases:** Configure in `deploy/aperag/values.yaml`.
    *   **Option B: Deploy with KubeBlocks:**

    ```bash
    cd deploy/databases/
    bash ./01-prepare.sh
    bash ./02-install-database.sh
    kubectl get pods -n default
    cd ../../
    ```

3.  **Deploy ApeRAG Application:**

    ```bash
    helm install aperag ./deploy/aperag --namespace default --create-namespace
    kubectl get pods -n default -l app.kubernetes.io/instance=aperag
    ```

**Access:**

```bash
kubectl port-forward svc/aperag-frontend 3000:3000 -n default
kubectl port-forward svc/aperag-api 8000:8000 -n default
```

*   **Web Interface:** http://localhost:3000
*   **API Documentation:** http://localhost:8000/docs
