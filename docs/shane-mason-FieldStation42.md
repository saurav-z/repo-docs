## How It Works

FieldStation42's components work together to simulate a realistic TV experience.

### `station_42.py`

This script is used for catalog creation and schedule generation. Catalogs, which store metadata about video content, are rebuilt whenever the content changes. The liquid-scheduler uses these catalogs and station configurations to build schedules.

### `field_player.py`

This is the main TV interface, playing content based on the current time and channel.  It fetches the current time's scheduled content. Tuning to a previous channel resumes playback from the correct point in time.  Player status is output to `runtime/play_status.socket`.

### `command_input.py`

An example script showing how to connect external hardware and programs to control channel changes. Listens for commands on the pi's UART connection and writes to `runtime/channel.socket`.

## üì∫ Connecting to a TV

FieldStation42 is designed for use with a Raspberry Pi.  You will need to convert the Pi's HDMI output to a signal your TV understands (Composite, RF).  Use an HDMI to composite or HDMI to RF adapter to convert the signal.

---

## üîå Connecting a Remote Control or Other Device

The player accepts external commands and publishes its status via sockets, allowing easy integration with external devices. See [this wiki page](https://github.com/shane-mason/FieldStation42/wiki/Changing-Channel-From-Script) for details on integrating with `channel.socket` and `play_status.socket`. For details on using a Bluetooth remote, see the [discussion boards](https://github.com/shane-mason/FieldStation42/discussions/47).

## üêû Troubleshooting

*   **Player Won't Start:** Check your video file paths and configuration files.
*   **No Video/Audio:** Ensure MPV is installed and functional.
*   **Web UI Not Loading:** Verify the server is running with `--server` and check your browser's console for errors.
*   **Database Errors:** Check file permissions and Python version.
