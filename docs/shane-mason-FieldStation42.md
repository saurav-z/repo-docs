## üõ†Ô∏è Installation & Setup

Follow the [FieldStation42 Guide](https://github.com/shane-mason/FieldStation42/wiki) for a complete walkthrough of installation and configuration.

### Quickstart Overview

1.  **Prerequisites:** Ensure you have Python 3 and MPV installed.
2.  **Clone:** Get the repository.
3.  **Run Installer:** Execute the installation script.
4.  **Add Content:**  Populate the catalog with your video files.
5.  **Configure Stations:** Modify the example configuration files.
6.  **Generate Schedule:** Run `python3 station_42.py` to build a schedule.
7.  **Watch TV:** Run `python3 field_player.py` to start the player.

## üïπÔ∏è How It Works

FieldStation42 uses multiple components to create an authentic TV experience:

### `station_42.py`

*   **Catalog & Schedule Management:** Creates catalogs to store metadata about the content. Catalogs must be rebuilt when content changes. Uses catalogs and station configurations to generate schedules.  You can manage catalogs and schedules via the terminal UI or command-line arguments (e.g., `station_42.py --help`).

### `field_player.py`

*   **TV Interface:** Reads the schedule and plays the correct video at the correct time, skipping to the proper position for the show. The player's status is written to a socket (`runtime/play_status.socket`) for integration with external programs. See the [wiki](https://github.com/shane-mason/FieldStation42/wiki/Changing-Channel-From-Script) for socket information.

## üîå Connecting Devices

FieldStation42 allows for easy integration with external devices:

*   **Raspberry Pi:**  Connect to a vintage TV using HDMI-to-composite or HDMI-to-RF adapters.
*   **Remote Control Integration:** Integrate with custom remote controls through the API and socket-based communication.

## üêû Troubleshooting

*   **Player Won't Start:** Verify video file paths and configuration files.
*   **No Video/Audio:** Confirm MPV is installed and operational.
*   **Web UI Problems:** Ensure the server is running (`--server`) and check your browser's developer tools for errors.
*   **Database Issues:**  Verify file permissions and Python version.
*   For additional help, consult the [wiki](https://github.com/shane-mason/FieldStation42/wiki) or create an issue.
