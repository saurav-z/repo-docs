# FieldStation42: Relive the Golden Age of Television

Bring the nostalgia of classic cable and broadcast TV to life with FieldStation42, a Python-based simulator that recreates the authentic experience of watching over-the-air (OTA) television. [See the original project on GitHub](https://github.com/shane-mason/FieldStation42).

## ‚öôÔ∏è How It Works

FieldStation42 uses multiple components to recreate a nostalgic TV experience:

### `station_42.py`
This script creates catalogs with metadata about the video content and then generates schedules based on station configuration. You'll typically run this command with `--rebuild_catalog` if you change your media library.  Run this script with no arguments to open a UI for schedule and catalog management, or use command line arguments.

### `field_player.py`
The main TV interface. This script starts by reading the generated schedule and then plays the appropriate video, at the correct position, for the current time. If you switch back to a previous channel, the player picks up where it should be in the program.

The player writes its status to `runtime/play_status.socket` and `runtime/channel.socket`.  See the [wiki](https://github.com/shane-mason/FieldStation42/wiki/Changing-Channel-From-Script) for details on controlling the player from external applications.

---

## üîå Connecting Devices

The `field_player.py` can receive external commands, and the `play_status.socket` and `channel.socket` can be read by other applications. For information on using this system, see the [wiki page](https://github.com/shane-mason/FieldStation42/wiki/Changing-Channel-From-Script). You can connect a remote control or other device.

## üêû Troubleshooting

*   **Player won't start:** Check video paths and config files.
*   **No video/audio:** Ensure MPV is installed and working.
*   **Web UI not loading:** Verify the server is running with `--server`. Check the browser console for errors.
*   **Database errors:** Check file permissions and Python version.
*   For more help, consult the [wiki](https://github.com/shane-mason/FieldStation42/wiki) or create an issue.
