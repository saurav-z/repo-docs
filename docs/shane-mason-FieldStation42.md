## üìÅ Project Structure

*   `station_42.py` ‚Äî Main CLI and UI for building catalogs and schedules
*   `field_player.py` ‚Äî Main TV interface/player
*   `fs42/` ‚Äî Core Python modules (catalog, schedule, API, etc.)
*   `confs/` ‚Äî Station and system configuration files
*   `catalog/` ‚Äî Your video content, organized by channel (created by installer)
*   `runtime/` ‚Äî Runtime files, sockets, and status (created by installer)
*   `fs42/fs42_server/static/` ‚Äî Web UI static files (HTML, JS, CSS)
*   `docs/` ‚Äî Images and documentation

## üõ†Ô∏è Configuration & Administration

### Quickstart Setup

*   Ensure Python 3 and MPV are installed.
*   Clone the repository.
*   Run the install script.
*   Add your video content.
*   Configure your stations by copying an example JSON file from `confs/examples` into `confs/`.
*   Generate a weekly schedule using `python3 station_42.py`. Use `--rebuild_catalog` if the video content has changed.
*   Run `field_player.py` to start watching.
*   (Optional) Configure start-on-boot using `fs42/hot_start.sh`.

## How It Works

FieldStation42 recreates the TV experience with multiple components:

*   **`station_42.py`:** Manages content catalogs and generates schedules.
*   **`field_player.py`:** The main TV interface, playing videos based on the schedule and current time.  It uses the runtime/play_status.socket to provide information.

## üêû Troubleshooting

*   **Player won't start:**  Check video paths and config files.
*   **No video/audio:** Verify MPV installation and functionality.
*   **Web UI not loading:** Ensure the server is running with `--server` and check for browser errors.
