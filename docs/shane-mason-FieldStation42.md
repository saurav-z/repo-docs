## Quick Start Guide

Get your retro TV experience up and running with these steps:

1.  **Clone the Repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/shane-mason/FieldStation42.git
    cd FieldStation42
    ```
2.  **Install Dependencies:**
    ```bash
    ./install.sh
    ```
3.  **Add Your Content:** Place your video files in the appropriate folders within the `catalog/` directory, following the structure defined in the example configurations in `confs/examples/`.
4.  **Configure Your Stations:** Copy an example configuration file from `confs/examples/` to `confs/` and edit it to define your channels.
5.  **Build Catalogs and Schedules:**
    ```bash
    python3 station_42.py --rebuild_catalog --schedule
    ```
6.  **Start the Player:**
    ```bash
    python3 field_player.py
    ```
7.  **(Optional) Start the Web Server:**
    ```bash
    python3 station_42.py --server
    ```

## Project Structure

*   `station_42.py`: Main CLI and UI for building catalogs and schedules.
*   `field_player.py`: The main TV interface/player.
*   `fs42/`: Core Python modules (catalog, schedule, API, etc.).
*   `confs/`: Station and system configuration files.
*   `catalog/`: Your video content, organized by channel.
*   `runtime/`: Runtime files, sockets, and status.
*   `fs42/fs42_server/static/`: Web UI static files (HTML, JS, CSS).
*   `docs/`: Images and documentation.

## Installation & Setup

### Detailed Guide

For comprehensive instructions on setting up and administering FieldStation42, see the [FieldStation42 Guide](https://github.com/shane-mason/FieldStation42/wiki).

## How It Works

FieldStation42 recreates the classic TV experience through its various components.

### `station_42.py`

Use this CLI or UI tool to create catalogs and generate schedules. Catalogs store metadata about station content and need to be rebuilt when content changes, which can take time depending on video quantity. Catalogs and station configuration data build the schedules. Run `station_42.py` without arguments to launch the terminal UI, or use command-line arguments for complete control.  For command-line options, run `station_42.py --help`.

### `field_player.py`

The main TV interface. This player loads the schedule and picks the correct video based on the current time.  Changing channels starts the same process.

The player's status and current channel are written to `runtime/play_status.socket`.  See [this page](https://github.com/shane-mason/FieldStation42/wiki/Changing-Channel-From-Script) for integration information.

### `command_input.py`

This is an example that shows how to connect external programs for channel changes and status information. This script listens on the UART connection and writes commands to `runtime/channel.socket`.

## Connecting to a TV

FieldStation42 supports connecting to vintage TVs.  An HDMI-to-composite or HDMI-to-RF adapter is recommended to connect to older televisions that lack an HDMI port.

## Connecting a Remote Control or Other Device

Integrate your devices and external programs by using the published status and commands through the use of `channel.socket` and `play_status.socket`.  For more information, [see this wiki page](https://github.com/shane-mason/FieldStation42/wiki/Changing-Channel-From-Script).

## Troubleshooting

*   **Player Won't Start:** Check video file paths and config files.
*   **No Video/Audio:** Ensure MPV is installed and working.
*   **Web UI Issues:** Make sure the server is running with `--server` and check your browser's dev tools.
*   **Database Errors:** Verify file permissions and Python version.
