## RoboVerse: A Unified Platform for Scalable Robot Learning

RoboVerse is a comprehensive platform, dataset, and benchmark designed to advance robot learning through unified environments and diverse tasks.  [View the original repository](https://github.com/RoboVerseOrg/RoboVerse).

**Key Features:**

*   **Unified Platform:** Provides a consistent framework for various robot learning tasks.
*   **Extensive Dataset:** Offers a rich and diverse dataset for training and evaluating robot skills.
*   **Benchmark Capabilities:** Enables standardized performance evaluation and comparison of different robot learning algorithms.
*   **Integration of Multiple Simulators:** Supports popular simulation frameworks such as Isaac Lab, Isaac Gym, MuJoCo, SAPIEN, PyBullet, Genesis, cuRobo, PyRep, and Blender.
*   **Integration with Popular Datasets and Projects:**  Includes data from projects like RLBench, Maniskill, and many others.
*   **Open Source and Community Driven:** Actively evolving with contributions from the open-source community.

## What's New

*   **RSS 2025 Acceptance:** RoboVerse has been accepted by RSS 2025!
*   **Code Release:** The codebase is now available and actively being developed.  Contributions are encouraged.
