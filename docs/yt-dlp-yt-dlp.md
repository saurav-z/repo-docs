## UPDATE

You can use `yt-dlp -U` to update if you are using the [release binaries](#release-files)

If you [installed with pip](https://github.com/yt-dlp/yt-dlp/wiki/Installation#with-pip), simply re-run the same command that was used to install the program

For other third-party package managers, see [the wiki](https://github.com/yt-dlp/yt-dlp/wiki/Installation#third-party-package-managers) or refer to their documentation

<a id="update-channels"></a>

There are currently three release channels for binaries: `stable`, `nightly` and `master`.

*   `stable` is the default channel, and many of its changes have been tested by users of the `nightly` and `master` channels.
*   The `nightly` channel has releases scheduled to build every day around midnight UTC, for a snapshot of the project's new patches and changes. This is the **recommended channel for regular users** of yt-dlp. The `nightly` releases are available from [yt-dlp/yt-dlp-nightly-builds](https://github.com/yt-dlp/yt-dlp-nightly-builds/releases) or as development releases of the `yt-dlp` PyPI package (which can be installed with pip's `--pre` flag).
*   The `master` channel features releases that are built after each push to the master branch, and these will have the very latest fixes and additions, but may also be more prone to regressions. They are available from [yt-dlp/yt-dlp-master-builds](https://github.com/yt-dlp/yt-dlp-master-builds/releases).

When using `--update`/`-U`, a release binary will only update to its current channel.
`--update-to CHANNEL` can be used to switch to a different channel when a newer version is available. `--update-to [CHANNEL@]TAG` can also be used to upgrade or downgrade to specific tags from a channel.

You may also use `--update-to <repository>` (`<owner>/<repository>`) to update to a channel on a completely different repository. Be careful with what repository you are updating to though, there is no verification done for binaries from different repositories.

Example usage:

*   `yt-dlp --update-to master` switch to the `master` channel and update to its latest release
*   `yt-dlp --update-to stable@2023.07.06` upgrade/downgrade to release to `stable` channel tag `2023.07.06`
*   `yt-dlp --update-to 2023.10.07` upgrade/downgrade to tag `2023.10.07` if it exists on the current channel
*   `yt-dlp --update-to example/yt-dlp@2023.09.24` upgrade/downgrade to the release from the `example/yt-dlp` repository, tag `2023.09.24`

**Important**: Any user experiencing an issue with the `stable` release should install or update to the `nightly` release before submitting a bug report:

```
# To update to nightly from stable executable/binary:
yt-dlp --update-to nightly

# To install nightly with pip:
python3 -m pip install -U --pre "yt-dlp[default]"
```

## DEPENDENCIES

Python versions 3.9+ (CPython) and 3.10+ (PyPy) are supported. Other versions and implementations may or may not work correctly.

<!-- Python 3.5+ uses VC++14 and it is already embedded in the binary created
<!x-- https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=26999 --x>
On Windows, [Microsoft Visual C++ 2010 SP1 Redistributable Package (x86)](https://download.microsoft.com/download/1/6/5/165255E7-1014-4D0A-B094-B6A430A6BFFC/vcredist_x86.exe) is also necessary to run yt-dlp. You probably already have this, but if the executable throws an error due to missing `MSVCR100.dll` you need to install it manually.
-->

While all the other dependencies are optional, `ffmpeg` and `ffprobe` are highly recommended

### Strongly recommended

*   **ffmpeg and ffprobe** - Required for [merging separate video and audio files](#format-selection), as well as for various [post-processing](#post-processing-options) tasks. License [depends on the build](https://www.ffmpeg.org/legal.html)

    There are bugs in ffmpeg that cause various issues when used alongside yt-dlp. Since ffmpeg is such an important dependency, we provide [custom builds](https://github.com/yt-dlp/FFmpeg-Builds#ffmpeg-static-auto-builds) with patches for some of these issues at [yt-dlp/FFmpeg-Builds](https://github.com/yt-dlp/FFmpeg-Builds). See [the readme](https://github.com/yt-dlp/FFmpeg-Builds#patches-applied) for details on the specific issues solved by these builds

    **Important**: What you need is ffmpeg *binary*, **NOT** [the Python package of the same name](https://pypi.org/project/ffmpeg)

To use or redistribute the dependencies, you must agree to their respective licensing terms.

The standalone release binaries are built with the Python interpreter and the packages marked with **\*** included.

If you do not have the necessary dependencies for a task you are attempting, yt-dlp will warn you. All the currently available dependencies are visible at the top of the `--verbose` output

## COMPILE

### Standalone PyInstaller Builds

To build the standalone executable, you must have Python and `pyinstaller` (plus any of yt-dlp's [optional dependencies](#dependencies) if needed). The executable will be built for the same CPU architecture as the Python used.

You can run the following commands:

```
python3 devscripts/install_deps.py --include pyinstaller
python3 devscripts/make_lazy_extractors.py
python3 -m bundle.pyinstaller
```

On some systems, you may need to use `py` or `python` instead of `python3`.

`python -m bundle.pyinstaller` accepts any arguments that can be passed to `pyinstaller`, such as `--onefile/-F` or `--onedir/-D`, which is further [documented here](https://pyinstaller.org/en/stable/usage.html#what-to-generate).

**Note**: Pyinstaller versions below 4.4 [do not support](https://github.com/pyinstaller/pyinstaller#requirements-and-tested-platforms) Python installed from the Windows store without using a virtual environment.

**Important**: Running `pyinstaller` directly **instead of** using `python -m bundle.pyinstaller` is **not** officially supported. This may or may not work correctly.

### Platform-independent Binary (UNIX)

You will need the build tools `python` (3.9+), `zip`, `make` (GNU), `pandoc`\* and `pytest`\*.

After installing these, simply run `make`.

You can also run `make yt-dlp` instead to compile only the binary without updating any of the additional files. (The build tools marked with **\*** are not needed for this)

### Related scripts

*   **`devscripts/install_deps.py`** - Install dependencies for yt-dlp.
*   **`devscripts/update-version.py`** - Update the version number based on the current date.
*   **`devscripts/set-variant.py`** - Set the build variant of the executable.
*   **`devscripts/make_changelog.py`** - Create a markdown changelog using short commit messages and update `CONTRIBUTORS` file.
*   **`devscripts/make_lazy_extractors.py`** - Create lazy extractors. Running this before building the binaries (any variant) will improve their startup performance. Set the environment variable `YTDLP_NO_LAZY_EXTRACTORS` to something nonempty to forcefully disable lazy extractor loading.

Note: See their `--help` for more info.

### Forking the project

If you fork the project on GitHub, you can run your fork's [build workflow](.github/workflows/build.yml) to automatically build the selected version(s) as artifacts. Alternatively, you can run the [release workflow](.github/workflows/release.yml) or enable the [nightly workflow](.github/workflows/release-nightly.yml) to create full (pre-)releases.

                                    The download will be considered successful
                                    even if the postprocessing fails
    --no-abort-on-error             Continue with next video on download errors;
                                    e.g. to skip unavailable videos in a
                                    playlist (default)
    --abort-on-error                Abort downloading of further videos if an
                                    error occurs (Alias: --no-ignore-errors)
    --dump-user-agent               Display the current user-agent and exit
    --list-extractors               List all supported extractors and exit
    --extractor-descriptions        Output descriptions of all supported
                                    extractors and exit
    --use-extractors NAMES          Extractor names to use separated by commas.
                                    You can also use regexes, "all", "default"
                                    and "end" (end URL matching); e.g. --ies
                                    "holodex.*,end,youtube". Prefix the name
                                    with a "-" to exclude it, e.g. --ies
                                    default,-generic. Use --list-extractors for
                                    a list of extractor names. (Alias: --ies)
    --default-search PREFIX         Use this prefix for unqualified URLs. E.g.
                                    "gvsearch2:python" downloads two videos from
                                    google videos for the search term "python".
                                    Use the value "auto" to let yt-dlp guess
                                    ("auto_warning" to emit a warning when
                                    guessing). "error" just throws an error. The
                                    default value "fixup_error" repairs broken
                                    URLs, but emits an error if this is not
                                    possible instead of searching
    --ignore-config                 Don't load any more configuration files
                                    except those given to --config-locations.
                                    For backward compatibility, if this option
                                    is found inside the system configuration
                                    file, the user configuration is not loaded.
                                    (Alias: --no-config)
    --no-config-locations           Do not load any custom configuration files
                                    (default). When given inside a configuration
                                    file, ignore all previous --config-locations
                                    defined in the current file
    --config-locations PATH         Location of the main configuration file;
                                    either the path to the config or its
                                    containing directory ("-" for stdin). Can be
                                    used multiple times and inside other
                                    configuration files
    --plugin-dirs PATH              Path to an additional directory to search
                                    for plugins. This option can be used
                                    multiple times to add multiple directories.
                                    Use "default" to search the default plugin
                                    directories (default)
    --no-plugin-dirs                Clear plugin directories to search,
                                    including defaults and those provided by
                                    previous --plugin-dirs
    --flat-playlist                 Do not extract a playlist's URL result
                                    entries; some entry metadata may be missing
                                    and downloading may be bypassed
    --no-flat-playlist              Fully extract the videos of a playlist

                                    Currently experimental and only supported
                                    for YouTube and Twitch
    --no-live-from-start            Download livestreams from the current time
                                    (default)
    --wait-for-video MIN[-MAX]      Wait for scheduled streams to become
                                    available. Pass the minimum number of
                                    seconds (or range) to wait between retries
    --no-wait-for-video             Do not wait for scheduled streams (default)
    --mark-watched                  Mark videos watched (even with --simulate)
    --no-mark-watched               Do not mark videos watched (default)
    --color [STREAM:]POLICY         Whether to emit color codes in output,
                                    optionally prefixed by the STREAM (stdout or
                                    stderr) to apply the setting to. Can be one
                                    of "always", "auto" (default), "never", or
                                    "no_color" (use non color terminal
                                    sequences). Use "auto-tty" or "no_color-tty"
                                    to decide based on terminal support only.
                                    Can be used multiple times
    --compat-options OPTS           Options that can help keep compatibility
                                    with youtube-dl or youtube-dlc
                                    configurations by reverting some of the
                                    changes made in yt-dlp. See "Differences in
                                    default behavior" for details
    --alias ALIASES OPTIONS         Create aliases for an option string. Unless
                                    an alias starts with a dash "-", it is
                                    prefixed with "--". Arguments are parsed
                                    according to the Python string formatting
                                    mini-language. E.g. --alias get-audio,-X "-S
                                    aext:{0},abr -x --audio-format {0}" creates
                                    options "--get-audio" and "-X" that takes an
                                    argument (ARG0) and expands to "-S
                                    aext:ARG0,abr -x --audio-format ARG0". All
                                    defined aliases are listed in the --help
                                    output. Alias options can trigger more
                                    aliases; so be careful to avoid defining
                                    recursive options. As a safety measure, each
                                    alias may be triggered a maximum of 100
                                    times. This option can be used multiple times
    -t, --preset-alias PRESET       Applies a predefined set of options. e.g.
                                    --preset-alias mp3. The following presets
                                    are available: mp3, aac, mp4, mkv, sleep.
                                    See the "Preset Aliases" section at the end
                                    for more info. This option can be used
                                    multiple times
```

## Network Options:

```
    --proxy URL                     Use the specified HTTP/HTTPS/SOCKS proxy. To
                                    enable SOCKS proxy, specify a proper scheme,
                                    e.g. socks5://user:pass@127.0.0.1:1080/.
                                    Pass in an empty string (--proxy "") for
                                    direct connection
    --socket-timeout SECONDS        Time to wait before giving up, in seconds
    --source-address IP             Client-side IP address to bind to
    --impersonate CLIENT[:OS]       Client to impersonate for requests. E.g.
                                    chrome, chrome-110, chrome:windows-10. Pass
                                    --impersonate="" to impersonate any client.
                                    Note that forcing impersonation for all
                                    requests may have a detrimental impact on
                                    download speed and stability
    --list-impersonate-targets      List available clients to impersonate.
    -4, --force-ipv4                Make all connections via IPv4
    -6, --force-ipv6                Make all connections via IPv6
    --enable-file-urls              Enable file:// URLs. This is disabled by
                                    default for security reasons.
```

## Geo-restriction:

```
    --geo-verification-proxy URL    Use this proxy to verify the IP address for
                                    some geo-restricted sites. The default proxy
                                    specified by --proxy (or none, if the option
                                    is not present) is used for the actual
                                    downloading
    --xff VALUE                     How to fake X-Forwarded-For HTTP header to
                                    try bypassing geographic restriction. One of
                                    "default" (only when known to be useful),
                                    "never", an IP block in CIDR notation, or a
                                    two-letter ISO 3166-2 country code
```

## Video Selection:

```
    -I, --playlist-items ITEM_SPEC  Comma separated playlist_index of the items
                                    to download. You can specify a range using
                                    "[START]:[STOP][:STEP]". For backward
                                    compatibility, START-STOP is also supported.
                                    Use negative indices to count from the right
                                    and negative STEP to download in reverse
                                    order. E.g. "-I 1:3,7,-5::2" used on a
                                    playlist of size 15 will download the items
                                    at index 1,2,3,7,11,13,15
    --min-filesize SIZE             Abort download if filesize is smaller than
                                    SIZE, e.g. 50k or 44.6M
    --max-filesize SIZE             Abort download if filesize is larger than
                                    SIZE, e.g. 50k or 44.6M
    --date DATE                     Download only videos uploaded on this date.
                                    The date can be "YYYYMMDD" or in the format 
                                    [now|today|yesterday][-N[day|week|month|year]].
                                    E.g. "--date today-2weeks" downloads only
                                    videos uploaded on the same day two weeks ago
    --datebefore DATE               Download only videos uploaded on or before
                                    this date. The date formats accepted are the
                                    same as --date
    --dateafter DATE                Download only videos uploaded on or after
                                    this date. The date formats accepted are the
                                    same as --date
    --match-filters FILTER          Generic video filter. Any "OUTPUT TEMPLATE"
                                    field can be compared with a number or a
                                    string using the operators defined in
                                    "Filtering Formats". You can also simply
                                    specify a field to match if the field is
                                    present, use "!field" to check if the field
                                    is not present, and "&" to check multiple
                                    conditions. Use a "\" to escape "&" or
                                    quotes if needed. If used multiple times,
                                    the filter matches if at least one of the
                                    conditions is met. E.g. --match-filters
                                    !is_live --match-filters "like_count>?100 &
                                    description~='(?i)\bcats \& dogs\b'" matches
                                    only videos that are not live OR those that
                                    have a like count more than 100 (or the like
                                    field is not available) and also has a
                                    description that contains the phrase "cats &
                                    dogs" (caseless). Use "--match-filters -" to
                                    interactively ask whether to download each
                                    video
    --no-match-filters              Do not use any --match-filters (default)
    --break-match-filters FILTER    Same as "--match-filters" but stops the
                                    download process when a video is rejected
    --no-break-match-filters        Do not use any --break-match-filters (default)
    --no-playlist                   Download only the video, if the URL refers
                                    to a video and a playlist
    --yes-playlist                  Download the playlist, if the URL refers to
                                    a video and a playlist
    --age-limit YEARS               Download only videos suitable for the given
                                    age
    --download-archive FILE         Download only videos not listed in the
                                    archive file. Record the IDs of all
                                    downloaded videos in it
    --no-download-archive           Do not use archive file (default)
    --max-downloads NUMBER          Abort after downloading NUMBER files
    --break-on-existing             Stop the download process when encountering
                                    a file that is in the archive supplied with
                                    the --download-archive option
    --no-break-on-existing          Do not stop the download process when
                                    encountering a file that is in the archive
                                    (default)
    --break-per-input               Alters --max-downloads, --break-on-existing,
                                    --break-match-filters, and autonumber to
                                    reset per input URL
    --no-break-per-input            --break-on-existing and similar options
                                    terminates the entire download queue
    --skip-playlist-after-errors N  Number of allowed failures until the rest of
                                    the playlist is skipped
```
