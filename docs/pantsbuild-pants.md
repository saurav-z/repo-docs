# Pants: Build Systems Reimagined for Monorepos

**Pants is the scalable build system designed to streamline development within monorepos, boosting efficiency and productivity across your projects.** [Check out the original repository](https://github.com/pantsbuild/pants) to learn more.

## Key Features of Pants:

*   **Explicit Dependency Modeling:** Clearly defines and manages relationships between code, ensuring build accuracy and maintainability.
*   **Fine-Grained Invalidation:** Only rebuilds what's necessary, leading to significantly faster build times.
*   **Shared Result Caching:**  Saves and reuses build results across your team, accelerating development.
*   **Concurrent Execution:** Executes tasks in parallel, dramatically reducing overall build duration.
*   **Remote Execution:**  Distributes builds across machines, scaling your build capacity.
*   **Unified Interface:** Provides a single, consistent interface for managing builds across multiple tools and programming languages.
*   **Extensibility via Plugin API:**  Customize and extend Pants to fit your specific project needs.
