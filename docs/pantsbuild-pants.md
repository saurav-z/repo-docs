Here's an improved and SEO-optimized README for the Pants Build System:

# Pants Build System: Build Your Monorepo with Speed and Efficiency

[View the original repository on GitHub](https://github.com/pantsbuild/pants)

Pants is a powerful and scalable build system designed to optimize and accelerate builds within large, multi-project codebases (monorepos).

## Key Features:

*   **Scalable Monorepo Support:** Efficiently manage builds across multiple projects, languages, and frameworks within a single repository.
*   **Explicit Dependency Modeling:** Ensures build accuracy and reproducibility through clear dependency definitions.
*   **Fine-Grained Invalidation:** Minimizes build times by only rebuilding what's necessary based on changes.
*   **Shared Result Caching:** Leverages caching to dramatically speed up builds by reusing previously computed results.
*   **Concurrent Execution:** Maximizes hardware utilization by running tasks in parallel.
*   **Remote Execution:** Distributes builds across a network for even faster execution, perfect for CI/CD.
*   **Unified Interface:** Provides a consistent interface for managing multiple tools and languages within your monorepo.
*   **Extensible Plugin API:** Customize and extend Pants' functionality to meet your specific project needs.
