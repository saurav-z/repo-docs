# Pants Build System: Build Faster & Scale Your Monorepo

**Pants is a cutting-edge build system designed to dramatically speed up builds in large, complex monorepos.**

## Key Features:

*   **Scalable Monorepo Support:** Efficiently manages builds for projects with multiple languages, frameworks, and applications within a single repository.
*   **Explicit Dependency Modeling:** Clearly defines project dependencies for accurate and efficient builds.
*   **Fine-Grained Invalidation:**  Only rebuilds what's necessary, drastically reducing build times.
*   **Shared Result Caching:**  Leverages caching to reuse previously built results, saving time and resources.
*   **Concurrent Execution:**  Executes builds in parallel to maximize hardware utilization.
*   **Remote Execution:** Supports offloading builds to remote machines for even faster performance.
*   **Unified Interface:** Provides a consistent interface for managing multiple tools and languages.
