# Pants: Build Faster, Build Smarter in Your Monorepo

**Pants is a powerful and scalable build system designed to help you efficiently manage and build large monorepos.** [(See the Original Repo)](https://github.com/pantsbuild/pants)

## Key Features of the Pants Build System

Pants offers a robust set of features for modern software development, especially within monorepo environments:

*   **Explicit Dependency Modeling:** Clearly define and manage project dependencies, improving build reproducibility and maintainability.
*   **Fine-Grained Invalidation:** Only rebuild what's necessary, dramatically reducing build times.
*   **Shared Result Caching:** Leverage caching to avoid redundant work across your team and CI systems.
*   **Concurrent Execution:** Execute tasks in parallel to further accelerate build processes.
*   **Remote Execution:** Distribute builds across multiple machines for even faster completion.
*   **Unified Interface for Multiple Tools and Languages:** Use a single interface to manage diverse languages and frameworks within your monorepo.
*   **Extensibility and Customizability:**  Tailor Pants to your specific needs with a flexible plugin API.
