# Pants: The Scalable Build System for Monorepos

**Supercharge your monorepo development with Pants, the build system designed for speed, scale, and efficiency.** (Learn more on the [official Pants Build System GitHub](https://github.com/pantsbuild/pants))

## Key Features of Pants

Pants offers a robust set of features to streamline your build processes:

*   **Explicit Dependency Modeling:** Clearly define and manage your project dependencies for optimal build performance and reliability.
*   **Fine-Grained Invalidation:** Only rebuild what's necessary, dramatically reducing build times.
*   **Shared Result Caching:** Leverage cached build results across your team, speeding up builds and reducing resource consumption.
*   **Concurrent Execution:** Utilize all available CPU cores to parallelize build steps and accelerate the build process.
*   **Remote Execution:** Distribute build tasks across a cluster for even faster builds and improved scalability.
*   **Unified Interface for Multiple Tools and Languages:** Manage builds for diverse projects with a single, consistent tool.
*   **Extensibility and Customizability:** Tailor Pants to your specific needs with a flexible plugin API.
