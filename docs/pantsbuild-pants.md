# Pants: The Scalable Build System for Monorepos

**Supercharge your software development with Pants, a powerful build system designed to efficiently manage large and complex codebases.**  ([View the original repo](https://github.com/pantsbuild/pants))

Pants is specifically engineered for _monorepos_, which house multiple projects, programming languages, and frameworks within a single, unified repository.  It provides the scalability and performance needed to handle the demands of modern software development.

## Key Features of Pants:

*   **Explicit Dependency Modeling:** Clearly define and manage the relationships between your code components.
*   **Fine-Grained Invalidation:**  Only rebuild what's necessary, saving time and resources.
*   **Shared Result Caching:**  Reuse previously built outputs, boosting build speed.
*   **Concurrent Execution:** Leverage multiple cores for parallel builds, dramatically reducing build times.
*   **Remote Execution:** Distribute build tasks across multiple machines for even faster builds.
*   **Unified Interface:** Seamlessly interact with a variety of tools and languages using a consistent interface.
*   **Extensibility:** Customize and extend Pants' functionality through a powerful plugin API.
