*   **Fine-grained Invalidation:** Optimize build times by only rebuilding what's necessary, based on changes.
*   **Shared Result Caching:** Leverage cached build results to speed up builds, both locally and remotely.
*   **Concurrent Execution:** Utilize multi-core processors to build projects in parallel, dramatically reducing build times.
*   **Remote Execution:** Distribute build tasks across a network of machines for even faster builds.
*   **Unified Interface:** Access and manage multiple tools and languages through a consistent, easy-to-use interface.
