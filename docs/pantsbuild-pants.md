## Key Features of Pants

Pants offers a powerful set of features to optimize your monorepo development workflow:

*   **Explicit Dependency Modeling:** Clearly define and manage project dependencies for accurate builds.
*   **Fine-Grained Invalidation:**  Only rebuild what's necessary, leading to significant time savings.
*   **Shared Result Caching:**  Leverage a shared cache to reuse build outputs and speed up builds across your team.
*   **Concurrent Execution:**  Run multiple build tasks simultaneously for dramatically faster builds.
*   **Remote Execution:**  Distribute build tasks across a cluster of machines for even greater speed and scalability.
*   **Unified Interface:**  Simplify your toolchain with a single interface that supports multiple languages and frameworks.
*   **Extensibility:**  Customize Pants to fit your specific needs with a robust plugin API.
