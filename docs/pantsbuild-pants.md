# Pants: The Scalable Build System for Monorepos

**Build and manage your monorepo with ease using Pants, a powerful and efficient build system.** [Explore the original repository on GitHub](https://github.com/pantsbuild/pants).

## Key Features of Pants

Pants is designed to handle the complexities of modern software development within a monorepo structure.  Here's what makes it stand out:

*   **Explicit Dependency Modeling:** Clearly define and manage dependencies for reproducible builds.
*   **Fine-Grained Invalidation:** Efficiently rebuild only what's necessary, saving time and resources.
*   **Shared Result Caching:** Speed up builds by caching and reusing build results.
*   **Concurrent Execution:** Leverage all available CPU cores for faster build times.
*   **Remote Execution:** Distribute builds across multiple machines for increased scalability.
*   **Unified Interface:** Streamline your build process with a consistent interface for various tools and languages.
*   **Extensibility:** Customize and extend Pants with a robust plugin API to meet your specific needs.
