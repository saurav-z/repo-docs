# Pants: The Scalable Build System for Monorepos

**Supercharge your development workflow with Pants, the build system designed for speed, efficiency, and scale in complex monorepo environments.**

[See the original repository on GitHub](https://github.com/pantsbuild/pants)

Pants is a powerful build system specifically tailored for monorepos, which are large codebases containing multiple projects, languages, and frameworks within a single repository. It's designed to handle the complexities of modern software development, providing a streamlined and efficient build process.

## Key Features of Pants:

*   **Explicit Dependency Modeling:** Clearly define and manage project dependencies, improving build accuracy and reliability.
*   **Fine-Grained Invalidation:** Quickly identify and rebuild only the necessary parts of your codebase, saving valuable time.
*   **Shared Result Caching:** Leverage cached build results across your team and CI, reducing build times.
*   **Concurrent Execution:** Execute builds in parallel, drastically speeding up the build process.
*   **Remote Execution:** Distribute build tasks across multiple machines for increased performance.
*   **Unified Interface for Multiple Tools and Languages:** Manage all your build processes from a single, consistent interface, regardless of the technologies involved.
*   **Extensibility and Customizability:** Tailor Pants to your specific needs with a flexible plugin API.
