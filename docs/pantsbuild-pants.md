# Pants: The Scalable Build System for Monorepos

**Supercharge your monorepo with Pants, a powerful build system designed for speed, efficiency, and scalability.**  [Explore the original repo](https://github.com/pantsbuild/pants) for the latest updates.

## Key Features of Pants

Pants provides a robust set of features tailored for managing complex codebases:

*   **Explicit Dependency Modeling:** Clearly define and manage project dependencies for better build understanding and maintainability.
*   **Fine-grained Invalidation:** Only rebuild what's necessary, leading to significantly faster build times.
*   **Shared Result Caching:** Leverage cached build results to avoid redundant work and accelerate development.
*   **Concurrent Execution:** Execute builds in parallel to maximize hardware utilization and speed up the process.
*   **Remote Execution:** Distribute build tasks across a network of machines for even greater scalability.
*   **Unified Interface:** Interact with various tools and languages through a single, consistent interface.
*   **Extensibility:** Customize and extend Pants with a plugin API to fit your specific needs.
