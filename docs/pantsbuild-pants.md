*   **Fine-Grained Invalidation:**  Efficiently rebuild only what's necessary, saving time.
*   **Shared Result Caching:** Accelerate builds by reusing pre-computed results.
*   **Concurrent Execution:** Leverage parallel processing for faster build times.
*   **Remote Execution:** Distribute build tasks across a network for enhanced performance.
*   **Unified Interface:**  Manage multiple tools and languages seamlessly through a single interface.
*   **Extensible Plugin API:** Customize and extend Pants with a flexible plugin architecture.
