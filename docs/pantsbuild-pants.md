## Key Features of Pants:

*   **Explicit Dependency Modeling:** Clearly defines project dependencies for accurate build planning.
*   **Fine-Grained Invalidation:** Only rebuilds what's changed, dramatically speeding up build times.
*   **Shared Result Caching:** Leverages a cache to avoid redundant work and accelerate builds.
*   **Concurrent Execution:**  Runs tasks in parallel to utilize all available CPU cores.
*   **Remote Execution:**  Distributes build tasks to remote machines for even faster builds.
*   **Unified Interface:**  Provides a single interface for managing tools and languages.
*   **Extensible and Customizable:** Supports plugins to adapt to specific project needs.
