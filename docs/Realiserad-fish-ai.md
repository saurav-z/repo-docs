# Fish-AI: Supercharge Your Fish Shell with AI üöÄ

**Fish-AI is a powerful plugin that leverages the power of AI to make your Fish shell experience more efficient, intuitive, and fun.** Enhance your command-line productivity by allowing AI to transform, fix, and complete commands. [Check it out on GitHub!](https://github.com/Realiserad/fish-ai)

## Key Features:

*   **Comment-to-Command & Command-to-Comment Conversion:** Effortlessly turn comments into executable commands and vice versa with a simple keystroke.
*   **Intelligent Command Correction:** Automatically fix typos and errors in your commands, similar to `thefuck`.
*   **AI-Powered Autocompletion:** Get context-aware command suggestions as you type with a built-in fuzzy finder.
*   **Customizable Keybindings:** Control the AI features with two configurable keyboard shortcuts.
*   **LLM Flexibility:** Connect to your preferred LLM, including self-hosted options, for ultimate control.
*   **Open Source & Auditable:** Enjoy the transparency and flexibility of open-source code (approx. 2000 lines of code).
*   **Easy Installation & Updates:** Install and manage `fish-ai` seamlessly using `fisher`.
*   **Compatibility:** Works well with other Fish plugins like `fzf.fish` and `tide`.
*   **Non-Invasive:** Doesn't wrap your shell, install telemetry, or require a specific terminal emulator.

### Store API Keys Securely

Use the `fish_ai_put_api_key` command to store API keys in your keyring.

## üïπÔ∏è How to Use

### Comment/Command Conversion

*   Type a comment (starting with `#`) and press **Ctrl + P** to get a command.
*   Type a command and press **Ctrl + P** to get a comment explaining it.

### Autocompletion

*   Start typing a command/comment, then press **Ctrl + Space** to see completions in `fzf`.

### Suggest Fixes

*   If a command fails, press **Ctrl + Space** to get suggested fixes.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Advanced Configuration

Modify `fish-ai.ini` for advanced settings:

### Keybindings

*   Customize with `keymap_1` (default: Ctrl + P) and `keymap_2` (default: Ctrl + Space). Use `fish_key_reader` to get escape sequences.

### Language

*   Set `language = <language>` to get command explanations in another language.

### Temperature

*   Adjust the randomness of responses with `temperature = <value>` (0.0 - 1.0).  Set to `None` to disable for models that do not support temperature.

### Completions

*   Control the number of suggestions with `completions = <number>` (default: 5) and `refined_completions = <number>` (default: 3).

### History Personalization

*   Enable commandline history with `history_size = <number>` (default: 0).

### Preview Pipes

*   Preview pipe output with `preview_pipe = True`.  (Disabled by default)

### Progress Indicator

*   Customize the loading indicator with `progress_indicator = <characters>`.

### Switching Contexts

*   Use the `fish_ai_switch_context` command to switch between configuration sections.

## üîí Data Privacy

`fish-ai` sends the OS name and command-line buffer to the LLM.  It also sends the contents of any files mentioned, and `<command> --help` when explaining commands. An excerpt of command history can also be sent.

If you're concerned about data privacy, use a self-hosted LLM.

### Redaction

*   Sensitive info (passwords, API keys, private keys, bearer tokens) is redacted before submission.
*   Disable redaction with `redact = False` (only if you trust the LLM provider).

## üë®‚Äçüíª Development

*   Review `ARCHITECTURE.md` for development information.
*   Use `devcontainer.json` with Codespaces or VS Code's Dev Containers extension for development.
*   Install from a local copy using `fisher install .`.
*   Enable debug logging with `debug = True` and optionally `log = /path/to/file`.
*   Installation tests run automatically.
*   Python modules are tested using `pytest`.
*   Releases are automated via GitHub Actions.
