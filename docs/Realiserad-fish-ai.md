Create a configuration file at `$XDG_CONFIG_HOME/fish-ai.ini` (or `~/.config/fish-ai.ini` if `$XDG_CONFIG_HOME` is not set) to specify your preferred LLM.

#### GitHub Models

```ini
[fish-ai]
configuration = github

[github]
provider = self-hosted
server = https://models.inference.ai.azure.com
api_key = <paste GitHub PAT here>
model = gpt-4o-mini
```

Get a personal access token (PAT) [here](https://github.com/settings/tokens). No permissions are required.

#### Self-hosted

[fish-ai]
configuration = openrouter

[openrouter]
provider = self-hosted
server = https://openrouter.ai/api/v1

```

#### DeepSeek

```ini
[deepseek]
provider = deepseek
api_key = <your API key>
model = deepseek-chat
```

#### Groq

```ini
[groq]
provider = groq

### Store API Key

Use `fish_ai_put_api_key` to securely store your API key in your keyring, instead of in the configuration file.

## üôâ How to Use

### Comment-to-Command & Command-to-Comment

*   Type a comment (starting with `#`) and press **Ctrl + P** to convert it into a shell command.
*   Type a command and press **Ctrl + P** to generate a comment explaining the command's function.

### Autocompletion

*   Start typing a command or comment and press **Ctrl + Space** to see completion suggestions via [`fzf`](https://github.com/junegunn/fzf).
*   Refine the results by providing additional instructions and pressing **Ctrl + P** inside `fzf`.

### Command Fixes

*   If a command fails, press **Ctrl + Space** at the command prompt to get a suggestion to fix the error.

## ü§∏ Additional Options

Customize `fish-ai` behavior within your `fish-ai.ini` configuration:

*   **Change Keybindings:** Modify `keymap_1` (Ctrl + P) and `keymap_2` (Ctrl + Space) with desired key sequences. Use [`fish_key_reader`](https://fishshell.com/docs/current/cmds/fish_key_reader.html) to identify key codes.
*   **Language:** Set the `language` option for command explanations in a different language.
*   **Temperature:** Adjust the `temperature` (0-1) for LLM creativity.  Disable with `temperature = None`.
*   **Completions:** Control the number of suggested completions with `completions` and `refined_completions` options.
*   **History:** Personalize completions using your command-line history with the `history_size` option.
*   **Preview Pipe:** Enable pipe output with `preview_pipe = True`.
*   **Progress Indicator:** Customize the progress indicator using `progress_indicator`.

## üé≠ Context Switching

Switch between configuration sections using the `fish_ai_switch_context` command.

## üêæ Data Privacy

`fish-ai` sends your OS name and command buffer to the LLM.  It also sends file contents, command help outputs, previous command buffers and terminal output.  Use a self-hosted LLM for maximum privacy.

### Redaction of Sensitive Information

`fish-ai` attempts to redact sensitive information, such as passwords and API keys. Disable redaction with `redact = False`.

## üî® Development

See [`ARCHITECTURE.md`](https://github.com/Realiserad/fish-ai/blob/main/ARCHITECTURE.md) for development insights.

Use the provided `devcontainer.json` for development with GitHub Codespaces or VS Code's Dev Containers extension.

Install from a local copy using: `fisher install .`

### Enable Debug Logging

Enable logging by setting `debug = True` in `fish-ai.ini`. Customize the log file location with `log = <path>`.

### Testing

Installation tests are run on GitHub Actions.  Python modules can be tested with `pytest`.

### Release Creation

Releases are automatically created by GitHub Actions upon pushing a new tag.
```bash
set tag (grep '^version =' pyproject.toml | \
    cut -d '=' -f2- | \
    string replace -ra '[ "]' '')
git tag -a "v$tag" -m "üöÄ v$tag"
git push origin "v$tag"
