## Supported Models

(See original for detailed list. Highlights include LLaMA 3, Qwen, Mixtral, Gemma, etc.)

## Supported Training Approaches

(See original for the table. Includes Pre-training, SFT, Reward Modeling, PPO, DPO, KTO, ORPO, SimPO).

## Getting Started

### Installation

(See original for installation instructions, including source, Docker, and platform-specific instructions)

### Quickstart

Use these commands for LoRA fine-tuning, inference, and merging:

```bash
llamafactory-cli train examples/train_lora/llama3_lora_sft.yaml
llamafactory-cli chat examples/inference/llama3_lora_sft.yaml
llamafactory-cli export examples/merge_lora/llama3_lora_sft.yaml
```

For more advanced usage, see [examples/README.md](examples/README.md).

### Fine-Tuning with LLaMA Board GUI (powered by [Gradio](https://github.com/gradio-app/gradio))

```bash
llamafactory-cli webui
```

### Deployment

(See original for Docker, API, and ModelScope/Modelers Hub download instructions)
