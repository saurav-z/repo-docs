## **Key Features**

*   **Extensive Model Support**:  Fine-tune a vast array of models including LLaMA, Mistral, Qwen, Gemma, and many more.
*   **Versatile Training Methods**: Supports a variety of techniques like (continuous) pre-training, supervised fine-tuning, reward modeling, and advanced methods such as LoRA and QLoRA.
*   **Advanced Algorithms**: Leverage cutting-edge optimizers and techniques, including GaLore, BAdam, APOLLO, and FlashAttention-2, for improved performance and efficiency.
*   **User-Friendly Interface**: Offers a zero-code CLI and a Gradio-powered Web UI (LLaMA Board) for easy fine-tuning.
*   **Flexible Deployment**:  Deploy your fine-tuned models using an OpenAI-style API and vLLM for faster inference.

## **Supported Models**

LLaMA Factory supports a wide range of LLMs.  (See details in the [Supported Models](#supported-models) section.)

## **Supported Training Approaches**

Choose from a comprehensive list of training approaches to meet your project requirements. (See the [Supported Training Approaches](#supported-training-approaches) section.)

## **Getting Started**

### Installation

Install LLaMA Factory with a single command.

```bash
git clone --depth 1 https://github.com/hiyouga/LLaMA-Factory.git
cd LLaMA-Factory
pip install -e ".[torch,metrics]" --no-build-isolation
```

### Quickstart

Get up and running with these commands to fine-tune, infer, and merge a Llama3-8B-Instruct model.

```bash
llamafactory-cli train examples/train_lora/llama3_lora_sft.yaml
llamafactory-cli chat examples/inference/llama3_lora_sft.yaml
llamafactory-cli export examples/merge_lora/llama3_lora_sft.yaml
```

### Fine-Tuning with LLaMA Board GUI (powered by Gradio)

```bash
llamafactory-cli webui
```

### Deployment

Deploy your fine-tuned models with an OpenAI-style API and vLLM for faster inference.

```bash
API_PORT=8000 llamafactory-cli api examples/inference/llama3.yaml infer_backend=vllm vllm_enforce_eager=true
```
