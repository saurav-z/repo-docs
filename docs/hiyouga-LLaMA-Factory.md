## Getting Started

### Installation

Follow these steps to install LLaMA Factory:

1.  **Install from Source:**
    ```bash
    git clone --depth 1 https://github.com/hiyouga/LLaMA-Factory.git
    cd LLaMA-Factory
    pip install -e ".[torch,metrics]" --no-build-isolation
    ```
    *   Refer to the original README for detailed installation instructions, including extra dependencies and Windows/NPU-specific setups.

2.  **Install from Docker Image:**
    ```bash
    docker run -it --rm --gpus=all --ipc=host hiyouga/llamafactory:latest
    ```

    *   Pre-built images are available at: [https://hub.docker.com/r/hiyouga/llamafactory/tags](https://hub.docker.com/r/hiyouga/llamafactory/tags)
    *   See the original README for instructions on building the Docker image.

### Quickstart

Fine-tune, infer, and merge the Llama3-8B-Instruct model with these commands:

```bash
llamafactory-cli train examples/train_lora/llama3_lora_sft.yaml
llamafactory-cli chat examples/inference/llama3_lora_sft.yaml
llamafactory-cli export examples/merge_lora/llama3_lora_sft.yaml
```

*   Explore [examples/README.md](examples/README.md) for advanced usage.

### Fine-Tuning with LLaMA Board GUI

Launch the GUI with this command:

```bash
llamafactory-cli webui
```

### Deploy with OpenAI-style API and vLLM

```bash
API_PORT=8000 llamafactory-cli api examples/inference/llama3.yaml infer_backend=vllm vllm_enforce_eager=true
```

*   Refer to the original README for more deployment options, including ModelScope and Modelers Hub downloads.

## Projects Using LLaMA Factory

*   A list of projects that leverage LLaMA Factory can be found in the [Projects using LLaMA Factory](#projects-using-llama-factory) section of the original README.
