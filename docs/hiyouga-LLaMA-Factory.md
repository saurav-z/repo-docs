## Key Features

*   **Comprehensive Model Support:** Fine-tune a wide range of models including LLaMA, Mistral, Qwen, and many more.
*   **Versatile Training Methods:** Supports various training approaches, including pre-training, supervised fine-tuning, and reinforcement learning methods.
*   **Efficient Training:** Utilizes techniques like LoRA, QLoRA, and FlashAttention-2 for efficient training on limited resources.
*   **User-Friendly Interfaces:** Offers both a command-line interface (CLI) and a web-based user interface (Web UI) for easy model training.
*   **API Deployment:** Deploy your fine-tuned models with an OpenAI-style API using vLLM for faster inference.
*   **Monitoring and Logging:** Integrates with popular logging tools such as LlamaBoard, TensorBoard, Wandb, and SwanLab for experiment tracking.

## Supported Models

A comprehensive list of supported models can be found [here](#supported-models).

## Supported Training Approaches

*   **Pre-Training**
*   **Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT)**
*   **Reward Modeling**
*   **PPO Training**
*   **DPO Training**

## Getting Started

### Installation

Detailed installation instructions can be found [here](#installation).

### Quickstart

Get started with fine-tuning, inference, and merging using these three commands:

```bash
llamafactory-cli train examples/train_lora/llama3_lora_sft.yaml
llamafactory-cli chat examples/inference/llama3_lora_sft.yaml
llamafactory-cli export examples/merge_lora/llama3_lora_sft.yaml
```

See [examples/README.md](examples/README.md) for advanced usage.

### Fine-tuning with LLaMA Board GUI (powered by [Gradio](https://github.com/gradio-app/gradio))

```bash
llamafactory-cli webui
```

### API Deployment

Deploy with OpenAI-style API and vLLM

```bash
API_PORT=8000 llamafactory-cli api examples/inference/llama3.yaml infer_backend=vllm vllm_enforce_eager=true
```
