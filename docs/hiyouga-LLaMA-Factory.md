## Overview

**LLaMA Factory is your all-in-one solution for efficient and versatile fine-tuning of 100+ large language models.** [Explore the original repo](https://github.com/hiyouga/LLaMA-Factory) for details. This powerful toolkit simplifies the process of training and deploying LLMs with a range of cutting-edge features and support for various model architectures and training techniques.

## Key Features

*   **Broad Model Support:** Fine-tune a vast array of LLMs, including LLaMA, Mistral, Qwen, and more (see [Supported Models](#supported-models--training-approaches)).
*   **Comprehensive Training Approaches:** Utilize various techniques like (Continuous) pre-training, (multimodal) supervised fine-tuning, reward modeling, PPO, DPO, and QLoRA (see [Supported Training Approaches](#supported-models--training-approaches)).
*   **Optimized for Efficiency:** Leverage advanced algorithms like GaLore, BAdam, and FlashAttention-2, along with quantization techniques (QLoRA, AWQ, etc.) to optimize training on various hardware.
*   **Flexible Deployment:** Easily deploy your fine-tuned models with an OpenAI-style API and vLLM.
*   **User-Friendly Interface:** Utilize the command-line interface or the Gradio-powered Web UI (LLaMA Board) for effortless training and experimentation.
*   **Experiment Tracking:** Seamlessly integrate with experiment monitors such as TensorBoard, Wandb, and SwanLab.

## Getting Started

### Installation

```bash
git clone --depth 1 https://github.com/hiyouga/LLaMA-Factory.git
cd LLaMA-Factory
pip install -e ".[torch,metrics]" --no-build-isolation
```

Refer to the [installation section](#installation) for detailed instructions.

### Quickstart

Fine-tune, run inference, and merge a Llama3-8B-Instruct model with these commands:

```bash
llamafactory-cli train examples/train_lora/llama3_lora_sft.yaml
llamafactory-cli chat examples/inference/llama3_lora_sft.yaml
llamafactory-cli export examples/merge_lora/llama3_lora_sft.yaml
```

### Fine-Tuning with LLaMA Board GUI (powered by [Gradio](https://github.com/gradio-app/gradio))

```bash
llamafactory-cli webui
```

### Deployment

Deploy your models with the OpenAI-style API using vLLM:

```bash
API_PORT=8000 llamafactory-cli api examples/inference/llama3.yaml infer_backend=vllm vllm_enforce_eager=true
```

## Supported Models & Training Approaches

*   **Supported Models:** A comprehensive list of supported models, including LLaMA, Mistral, Qwen, and many more, can be found [here](#supported-models).
*   **Supported Training Approaches:** LLaMA Factory offers a variety of training approaches, including full-tuning, LoRA, QLoRA, and others (see [Supported Training Approaches](#supported-training-approaches)).

## Advanced Features

*   **Experiment Tracking:** Utilize Weights & Biases (Wandb) or SwanLab for experiment logging and visualization.
*   **Model Integration:** Download models and datasets from Hugging Face, ModelScope Hub, and Modelers Hub.
*   **Advanced Optimizers:** Integrate advanced optimizers such as GaLore, BAdam, Muon, and more (see [Changelog](#changelog)).
