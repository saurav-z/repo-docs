## Getting Started

### Installation

Install LLaMA Factory easily:

```bash
git clone --depth 1 https://github.com/hiyouga/LLaMA-Factory.git
cd LLaMA-Factory
pip install -e ".[torch,metrics]" --no-build-isolation
```

*   Comprehensive installation instructions and Docker setup are available in the [Installation](#installation) section.

### Quickstart

Fine-tune, infer, and merge with these simple commands:

```bash
llamafactory-cli train examples/train_lora/llama3_lora_sft.yaml
llamafactory-cli chat examples/inference/llama3_lora_sft.yaml
llamafactory-cli export examples/merge_lora/llama3_lora_sft.yaml
```

### Fine-tuning with LLaMA Board GUI

Launch the web UI:

```bash
llamafactory-cli webui
```

### API Deployment

Deploy with an OpenAI-style API and vLLM:

```bash
API_PORT=8000 llamafactory-cli api examples/inference/llama3.yaml infer_backend=vllm vllm_enforce_eager=true
```

*   Explore the [Getting Started](#getting-started) section for detailed instructions and advanced usage.
