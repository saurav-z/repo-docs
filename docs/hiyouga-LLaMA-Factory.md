llamafactory-cli train examples/train_lora/llama3_lora_sft.yaml
llamafactory-cli chat examples/inference/llama3_lora_sft.yaml
llamafactory-cli export examples/merge_lora/llama3_lora_sft.yaml
```

### Fine-Tuning with LLaMA Board GUI

Launch the user-friendly Gradio-powered Web UI with:

```bash
llamafactory-cli webui
```
