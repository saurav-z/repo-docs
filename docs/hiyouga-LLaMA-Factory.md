## Getting Started

### Installation

Follow the instructions below to install LLaMA Factory:

*   [Install from Source](#install-from-source)
*   [Install from Docker Image](#install-from-docker-image)

### Quickstart

Fine-tune, infer, and merge a Llama3-8B-Instruct model with these three commands:

```bash
llamafactory-cli train examples/train_lora/llama3_lora_sft.yaml
llamafactory-cli chat examples/inference/llama3_lora_sft.yaml
llamafactory-cli export examples/merge_lora/llama3_lora_sft.yaml
```
### Fine-Tuning with LLaMA Board GUI

Use the following command to launch the LLaMA Board GUI.

```bash
llamafactory-cli webui
```

### Deploy with OpenAI-style API and vLLM

Deploy your fine-tuned model with an OpenAI-style API and vLLM.

```bash
API_PORT=8000 llamafactory-cli api examples/inference/llama3.yaml infer_backend=vllm vllm_enforce_eager=true
```

[See examples/README.md](examples/README.md) for more advanced usage (including distributed training).
