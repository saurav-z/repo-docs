## Key Features

*   **Versatile Model Support:** Fine-tune a wide range of LLMs, including LLaMA, Mistral, Qwen, Gemma, and many more.
*   **Flexible Training Approaches:** Leverage various methods such as (Continuous) pre-training, (multimodal) supervised fine-tuning, reward modeling, PPO, DPO, and more.
*   **Efficient Training Techniques:** Utilize 16-bit full-tuning, freeze-tuning, LoRA, and QLoRA for efficient resource utilization.
*   **Advanced Algorithms:** Access cutting-edge optimization algorithms like GaLore, BAdam, APOLLO, and Muon.
*   **Practical Enhancements:** Incorporate FlashAttention-2, Unsloth, and other tricks for improved performance.
*   **Wide Range of Tasks:** Tackle diverse tasks like multi-turn dialogue, tool usage, and image understanding.
*   **Comprehensive Monitoring:** Monitor experiments with LlamaBoard, TensorBoard, Wandb, MLflow, and SwanLab.
*   **Accelerated Inference:** Deploy with OpenAI-style API, Gradio UI, and CLI using vLLM or SGLang.

## Supported Models

Llama Factory supports a wide array of models. For a comprehensive list, please refer to the [Supported Models](#supported-models) section.

## Supported Training Approaches

Llama Factory offers a variety of training methods.  See the [Supported Training Approaches](#supported-training-approaches) section for more details.

## Getting Started

### Installation

Detailed installation instructions, including instructions for specific environments (Windows, Ascend NPU, and others) are available in the [Installation](#installation) section.

### Quickstart

Get up and running quickly with these three commands for LoRA fine-tuning, inference, and merging:

```bash
llamafactory-cli train examples/train_lora/llama3_lora_sft.yaml
llamafactory-cli chat examples/inference/llama3_lora_sft.yaml
llamafactory-cli export examples/merge_lora/llama3_lora_sft.yaml
```

### Fine-tuning with LLaMA Board GUI

Launch the user-friendly web interface for training, evaluation, and inference:

```bash
llamafactory-cli webui
```

### Deployment

Deploy your fine-tuned models with the OpenAI-style API and vLLM for fast inference:

```bash
API_PORT=8000 llamafactory-cli api examples/inference/llama3.yaml infer_backend=vllm vllm_enforce_eager=true
```
