## Getting Started

### Installation

Follow these steps to get started with LLaMA Factory:

1.  **Install from Source**:

    ```bash
    git clone --depth 1 https://github.com/hiyouga/LLaMA-Factory.git
    cd LLaMA-Factory
    pip install -e ".[torch,metrics]" --no-build-isolation
    ```

    *   Extra dependencies available: torch, torch-npu, metrics, deepspeed, liger-kernel, bitsandbytes, hqq, eetq, gptq, aqlm, vllm, sglang, galore, apollo, badam, adam-mini, qwen, minicpm\_v, openmind, swanlab, dev
2.  **Docker Installation:**
    Run pre-built docker image or build your own. Instructions available in the [docs](#build-docker).
3.  **Virtual Environment:**
    Optionally, create a virtual environment for isolated package management using uv.

    ```bash
    uv sync --extra torch --extra metrics --prerelease=allow
    ```

### Quickstart

Quickly fine-tune, infer and merge.

1.  **Fine-tuning**:

    ```bash
    llamafactory-cli train examples/train_lora/llama3_lora_sft.yaml
    ```

2.  **Inference**:

    ```bash
    llamafactory-cli chat examples/inference/llama3_lora_sft.yaml
    ```

3.  **Merging**:

    ```bash
    llamafactory-cli export examples/merge_lora/llama3_lora_sft.yaml
    ```

    *   See [examples/README.md](examples/README.md) for advanced usage (including distributed training).

### Fine-Tuning with LLaMA Board GUI (powered by [Gradio](https://github.com/gradio-app/gradio))

```bash
llamafactory-cli webui
```

### Deploy with OpenAI-style API and vLLM

```bash
API_PORT=8000 llamafactory-cli api examples/inference/llama3.yaml infer_backend=vllm vllm_enforce_eager=true
```
