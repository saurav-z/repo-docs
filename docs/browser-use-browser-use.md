## Project Vision

Make your computer do what you tell it to do using the power of AI and web browsers!

## Development Roadmap

### Agent

*   [ ] Improve agent memory to handle +100 steps
*   [ ] Enhance planning capabilities (load website specific context)
*   [ ] Reduce token consumption (system prompt, DOM state)

### DOM Extraction

*   [ ] Enable detection for all possible UI elements
*   [ ] Improve state representation for UI elements so that all LLMs can understand what's on the page

### Workflows

*   [ ] Let user record a workflow - which we can rerun with browser-use as a fallback
*   [ ] Make rerunning of workflows work, even if pages change

### User Experience

*   [ ] Create various templates for tutorial execution, job application, QA testing, social media, etc. which users can just copy & paste.
*   [ ] Improve docs
*   [ ] Make it faster

### Parallelization

*   [ ] Human work is sequential. The real power of a browser agent comes into reality if we can parallelize similar tasks. For example, if you want to find contact information for 100 companies, this can all be done in parallel and reported back to a main agent, which processes the results and kicks off parallel subtasks again.

## Contribute

Contributions are welcome!  Please open issues for bugs or feature requests.  For documentation contributions, check out the `/docs` folder.

## Robust Agent Testing üß™

Ensure your agents are resilient by running your tasks automatically in our CI on every update!

*   **Add Your Task:** Create a YAML file in `tests/agent_tasks/` (see the [`README there`](tests/agent_tasks/README.md) for details).
*   **Automated Validation:** Every update triggers your task and evaluates it using your defined criteria.

## Local Setup

Learn more about the library with the [local setup üìï](https://docs.browser-use.com/development/local-setup).

**Important Note:** `main` is the primary development branch. For production use, install a [versioned release](https://github.com/browser-use/browser-use/releases).
