[**‚û°Ô∏è Explore the Cloud Version ‚òÅÔ∏è**](https://cloud.browser-use.com)

## Key Features

*   **AI-Powered Automation:** Enables AI agents to interact with web browsers.
*   **Easy Integration:** Simple setup with Python, supporting popular LLMs.
*   **Web UI & CLI:** Test and interact with browser automation using a web interface or CLI.
*   **MCP Integration:** Supports the Model Context Protocol (MCP) for seamless integration with Claude Desktop and other tools.

## Quick Start

### Installation

Install the Browser-Use Python package:

```bash
pip install browser-use
```

Install the browser (e.g., Chromium):

```bash
playwright install chromium --with-deps --no-shell
```

### Basic Usage

Here's a simple example:

```python
import asyncio
from dotenv import load_dotenv
load_dotenv()
from browser_use import Agent
from browser_use.llm import ChatOpenAI

async def main():
    agent = Agent(
        task="Compare the price of gpt-4o and DeepSeek-V3",
        llm=ChatOpenAI(model="o4-mini", temperature=1.0),
    )
    await agent.run()

asyncio.run(main())
```

Remember to add your API keys to a `.env` file:

```bash
OPENAI_API_KEY=
ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=
AZURE_OPENAI_ENDPOINT=
AZURE_OPENAI_KEY=
GOOGLE_API_KEY=
DEEPSEEK_API_KEY=
GROK_API_KEY=
NOVITA_API_KEY=
```

For detailed settings and more, refer to the [documentation üìï](https://docs.browser-use.com).

### Testing with UI and CLI

*   **Web UI:** Test browser-use using its [Web UI](https://github.com/browser-use/web-ui).
*   **CLI:** Use the interactive CLI:

    ```bash
    pip install "browser-use[cli]"
    browser-use
    ```

## MCP Integration

Browser-use integrates with the Model Context Protocol (MCP):

### Use as MCP Server with Claude Desktop

Configure Claude Desktop:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "browser-use": {
      "command": "uvx",
      "args": ["browser-use[cli]", "--mcp"],
      "env": {
        "OPENAI_API_KEY": "sk-..."
      }
    }
  }
}
```

### Connect External MCP Servers to Browser-Use Agent

```python
import asyncio
from browser_use import Agent, Controller
from browser_use.mcp.client import MCPClient
from browser_use.llm import ChatOpenAI

async def main():
    # Initialize controller
    controller = Controller()
    
    # Connect to multiple MCP servers
    filesystem_client = MCPClient(
        server_name="filesystem",
        command="npx",
        args=["-y", "@modelcontextprotocol/server-filesystem", "/Users/me/documents"]
    )
    
    github_client = MCPClient(
        server_name="github", 
        command="npx",
        args=["-y", "@modelcontextprotocol/server-github"],
        env={"GITHUB_TOKEN": "your-github-token"}
    )
    
    # Connect and register tools from both servers
    await filesystem_client.connect()
    await filesystem_client.register_to_controller(controller)
    
    await github_client.connect()
    await github_client.register_to_controller(controller)
    
    # Create agent with MCP-enabled controller
    agent = Agent(
        task="Find the latest report.pdf in my documents and create a GitHub issue about it",
        llm=ChatOpenAI(model="gpt-4o"),
        controller=controller  # Controller has tools from both MCP servers
    )
    
    # Run the agent
    await agent.run()
    
    # Cleanup
    await filesystem_client.disconnect()
    await github_client.disconnect()

asyncio.run(main())
```

## Vision

Make web automation effortless and intuitive.

## Roadmap

### Agent
- [ ] Improve agent memory to handle +100 steps
- [ ] Enhance planning capabilities (load website specific context)
- [ ] Reduce token consumption (system prompt, DOM state)

### DOM Extraction
- [ ] Enable detection for all possible UI elements
- [ ] Improve state representation for UI elements so that all LLMs can understand what's on the page

### Workflows
- [ ] Let user record a workflow - which we can rerun with browser-use as a fallback
- [ ] Make rerunning of workflows work, even if pages change

### User Experience
- [ ] Create various templates for tutorial execution, job application, QA testing, social media, etc. which users can just copy & paste.
- [ ] Improve docs
- [ ] Make it faster

### Parallelization
- [ ] Human work is sequential. The real power of a browser agent comes into reality if we can parallelize similar tasks. For example, if you want to find contact information for 100 companies, this can all be done in parallel and reported back to a main agent, which processes the results and kicks off parallel subtasks again.

## üß™ Robust Agent Testing

Ensure the reliability of your agents.

-   **Add Your Task:** Create a YAML file in `tests/agent_tasks/` (see the [`README there`](tests/agent_tasks/README.md) for details).
-   **Automatic Validation:** Your tasks will be run and evaluated on every update.

## Local Setup

Learn more about setting up your local development environment in the [local setup üìï](https://docs.browser-use.com/development/local-setup).

**Important:** `main` is the primary development branch. Use a stable [versioned release](https://github.com/browser-use/browser-use/releases) for production.
