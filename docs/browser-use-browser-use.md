## Getting Started

### Installation

Install the library using pip:

```bash
pip install browser-use
```

Install browser dependencies (Playwright):

```bash
playwright install chromium --with-deps --no-shell
```

### Example Usage

Here's a simple example of how to use Browser Use:

```python
import asyncio
from dotenv import load_dotenv
load_dotenv()
from browser_use import Agent
from browser_use.llm import ChatOpenAI

async def main():
    agent = Agent(
        task="Compare the price of gpt-4o and DeepSeek-V3",
        llm=ChatOpenAI(model="o4-mini", temperature=1.0),
    )
    await agent.run()

asyncio.run(main())
```

Remember to add your API keys to a `.env` file.

### Interactive CLI

Use the interactive CLI for testing:

```bash
pip install "browser-use[cli]"
browser-use
```

## MCP Integration

Browser-use supports the [Model Context Protocol (MCP)](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/), enabling integration with Claude Desktop and other MCP-compatible clients.

### Use as MCP Server with Claude Desktop

Add browser-use to your Claude Desktop configuration:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "browser-use": {
      "command": "uvx",
      "args": ["browser-use", "--mcp"],
      "env": {
        "OPENAI_API_KEY": "sk-..."
      }
    }
  }
}
```

### Connect External MCP Servers to Browser-Use Agent

Browser-use agents can connect to multiple external MCP servers to extend their capabilities:

```python
import asyncio
from browser_use import Agent, Controller
from browser_use.mcp.client import MCPClient
from browser_use.llm import ChatOpenAI

async def main():
    # Initialize controller
    controller = Controller()
    
    # Connect to multiple MCP servers
    filesystem_client = MCPClient(
        server_name="filesystem",
        command="npx",
        args=["-y", "@modelcontextprotocol/server-filesystem", "/Users/me/documents"]
    )
    
    github_client = MCPClient(
        server_name="github", 
        command="npx",
        args=["-y", "@modelcontextprotocol/server-github"],
        env={"GITHUB_TOKEN": "your-github-token"}
    )
    
    # Connect and register tools from both servers
    await filesystem_client.connect()
    await filesystem_client.register_to_controller(controller)
    
    await github_client.connect()
    await github_client.register_to_controller(controller)
    
    # Create agent with MCP-enabled controller
    agent = Agent(
        task="Find the latest report.pdf in my documents and create a GitHub issue about it",
        llm=ChatOpenAI(model="gpt-4o"),
        controller=controller  # Controller has tools from both MCP servers
    )
    
    # Run the agent
    await agent.run()
    
    # Cleanup
    await filesystem_client.disconnect()
    await github_client.disconnect()

asyncio.run(main())
```
