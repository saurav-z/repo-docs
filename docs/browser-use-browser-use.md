## Quickstart

Install Browser Use using pip:

```bash
pip install browser-use
```

**Note**: If you do not have Chrome or Chromium installed, use the following command to download the latest Chromium:

```bash
uvx playwright install chromium --with-deps --no-shell
```

Spin up your agent:

```python
import asyncio
from dotenv import load_dotenv
load_dotenv()
from browser_use import Agent, ChatOpenAI

async def main():
    agent = Agent(
        task="Find the number of stars of the browser-use repo",
        llm=ChatOpenAI(model="gpt-4.1-mini"),
    )
    await agent.run()

asyncio.run(main())
```

Add your API keys for the provider you want to use to your `.env` file.

```bash
OPENAI_API_KEY=
```

## Model Context Protocol (MCP) Integration

Browser-use supports the [Model Context Protocol (MCP)](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/), allowing integration with Claude Desktop and other MCP-compatible clients.

### Using as an MCP Server with Claude Desktop

Add browser-use to your Claude Desktop configuration:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "browser-use": {
      "command": "uvx",
      "args": ["browser-use[cli]", "--mcp"],
      "env": {
        "OPENAI_API_KEY": "sk-..."
      }
    }
  }
}
```

This configuration gives Claude Desktop access to browser automation tools, which opens up the ability for web scraping, form filling, and more.

### Connecting External MCP Servers to Browser-Use Agent

Browser-use agents can connect to multiple external MCP servers to extend their capabilities:

```python
import asyncio
from browser_use import Agent, Controller, ChatOpenAI
from browser_use.mcp.client import MCPClient

async def main():
    # Initialize controller
    controller = Controller()

    # Connect to multiple MCP servers
    filesystem_client = MCPClient(
        server_name="filesystem",
        command="npx",
        args=["-y", "@modelcontextprotocol/server-filesystem", "/Users/me/documents"]
    )

    github_client = MCPClient(
        server_name="github",
        command="npx",
        args=["-y", "@modelcontextprotocol/server-github"],
        env={"GITHUB_TOKEN": "your-github-token"}
    )

    # Connect and register tools from both servers
    await filesystem_client.connect()
    await filesystem_client.register_to_controller(controller)

    await github_client.connect()
    await github_client.register_to_controller(controller)

    # Create agent with MCP-enabled controller
    agent = Agent(
        task="Find the latest pdf report in my documents and create a GitHub issue about it",
        llm=ChatOpenAI(model="gpt-4.1-mini"),
        controller=controller  # Controller has tools from both MCP servers
    )

    # Run the agent
    await agent.run()

    # Cleanup
    await filesystem_client.disconnect()
    await github_client.disconnect()

asyncio.run(main())
```

Check the [MCP documentation](https://docs.browser-use.com/customize/mcp-server) for more details.

## Vision

Automate your browser tasks with the help of AI.

## Roadmap

### Agent

*   \[ ] Make agent 3x faster
*   \[ ] Reduce token consumption (system prompt, DOM state)

### DOM Extraction

*   \[ ] Enable interaction with all UI elements
*   \[ ] Improve state representation for UI elements so that any LLM can understand what's on the page

### Workflows

*   \[ ] Let user record a workflow - which we can rerun with browser-use as a fallback

### User Experience

*   \[ ] Create various templates for tutorial execution, job application, QA testing, social media, etc. which users can just copy & paste.

### Parallelization

*   \[ ] Human work is sequential. The real power of a browser agent comes into reality if we can parallelize similar tasks. For example, if you want to find contact information for 100 companies, this can all be done in parallel and reported back to a main agent, which processes the results and kicks off parallel subtasks again.

## Contributing

We welcome your contributions! Feel free to open issues for bug reports or feature requests. To contribute to the docs, look in the `/docs` folder.

## üß™ Robust Agent Validation

Ensure task reliability through CI integration and automatic validation.

*   **Add Your Task:** Add a YAML file in `tests/agent_tasks/` (see the [`README there`](tests/agent_tasks/README.md) for details).
*   **Automated Validation:** Your task is automatically run and evaluated upon every update.

## Local Setup

Explore the library further through [local setup üìï](https://docs.browser-use.com/development/local-setup).

The `main` branch is under active development. For production purposes, install a [versioned release](https://github.com/browser-use/browser-use/releases).
