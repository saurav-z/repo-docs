## Quickstart

Get started with Browser Use in a few simple steps.

**Prerequisites:** Python 3.11+ and Chrome/Chromium installed.

1.  **Install the library:**

    ```bash
    pip install browser-use
    ```

2.  **(Optional) Install Chromium using Playwright:**

    ```bash
    uvx playwright install chromium --with-deps --no-shell
    ```

3.  **Run a simple agent:**

    ```python
    import asyncio
    from dotenv import load_dotenv
    load_dotenv()
    from browser_use import Agent, ChatOpenAI

    async def main():
        agent = Agent(
            task="Find the number of stars of the browser-use repo",
            llm=ChatOpenAI(model="gpt-4.1-mini"),
        )
        await agent.run()

    asyncio.run(main())
    ```

4.  **Configure your API keys:** Add your API keys for your preferred LLM provider to a `.env` file in your project's root directory.

    ```bash
    OPENAI_API_KEY=YOUR_OPENAI_API_KEY
    ```

For detailed configuration options and advanced usage, explore the [documentation üìï](https://docs.browser-use.com).

## Model Context Protocol (MCP) Integration

Browser Use seamlessly integrates with the [Model Context Protocol (MCP)](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/), enhancing its capabilities.

### Use as MCP Server with Claude Desktop

Configure Claude Desktop to use Browser Use:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "browser-use": {
      "command": "uvx",
      "args": ["browser-use[cli]", "--mcp"],
      "env": {
        "OPENAI_API_KEY": "sk-..."
      }
    }
  }
}
```

### Connect External MCP Servers to Browser-Use Agent

Extend your agent's functionality:

```python
import asyncio
from browser_use import Agent, Tools, ChatOpenAI
from browser_use.mcp.client import MCPClient

async def main():
    # Initialize tools
    tools = Tools()

    # Connect to multiple MCP servers
    filesystem_client = MCPClient(
        server_name="filesystem",
        command="npx",
        args=["-y", "@modelcontextprotocol/server-filesystem", "/Users/me/documents"]
    )

    github_client = MCPClient(
        server_name="github",
        command="npx",
        args=["-y", "@modelcontextprotocol/server-github"],
        env={"GITHUB_TOKEN": "your-github-token"}
    )

    # Connect and register tools from both servers
    await filesystem_client.connect()
    await filesystem_client.register_to_tools(tools)

    await github_client.connect()
    await github_client.register_to_tools(tools)

    # Create agent with MCP-enabled tools
    agent = Agent(
        task="Find the latest pdf report in my documents and create a GitHub issue about it",
        llm=ChatOpenAI(model="gpt-4.1-mini"),
        tools=tools  # Tools has tools from both MCP servers
    )

    # Run the agent
    await agent.run()

    # Cleanup
    await filesystem_client.disconnect()
    await github_client.disconnect()

asyncio.run(main())
```

For detailed instructions, refer to the [MCP documentation](https://docs.browser-use.com/customize/mcp-server).

## Our Vision

Browser Use empowers you to effortlessly control your browser with simple commands.

## Roadmap

Explore our future development plans:

### Agent

*   \[ ] Make agent 3x faster
*   \[ ] Reduce token consumption (system prompt, DOM state)

### DOM Extraction

*   \[ ] Enable interaction with all UI elements
*   \[ ] Improve state representation for UI elements so that any LLM can understand what's on the page

### Workflows

*   \[ ] Let user record a workflow - which we can rerun with browser-use as a fallback

### User Experience

*   \[ ] Create various templates for tutorial execution, job application, QA testing, social media, etc. which users can just copy & paste.

### Parallelization

*   \[ ] Human work is sequential. The real power of a browser agent comes into reality if we can parallelize similar tasks. For example, if you want to find contact information for 100 companies, this can all be done in parallel and reported back to a main agent, which processes the results and kicks off parallel subtasks again.

## Contribute

We welcome contributions! Report bugs and suggest features by opening issues.  Contribute to the documentation in the `/docs` folder.

## Robust Agent Testing

Ensure your agents are reliable with our continuous integration (CI) system:

*   **Add Your Task:** Create a YAML file in `tests/agent_tasks/` (see the [`README there`](tests/agent_tasks/README.md) for details).
*   **Automated Validation:** Your task will be automatically tested and evaluated on every update.

## Local Setup

Learn more about local development and setup by visiting the [local setup üìï](https://docs.browser-use.com/development/local-setup) documentation.

**Note:** `main` is the primary development branch. For production use, install a stable [versioned release](https://github.com/browser-use/browser-use/releases).
