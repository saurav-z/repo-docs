## Quick Start

Install the package:

```bash
pip install browser-use
```

Install browser dependencies:

```bash
playwright install chromium --with-deps --no-shell
```

Basic usage:

```python
import asyncio
from dotenv import load_dotenv
load_dotenv()
from browser_use import Agent
from browser_use.llm import ChatOpenAI

async def main():
    agent = Agent(
        task="Compare the price of gpt-4o and DeepSeek-V3",
        llm=ChatOpenAI(model="o4-mini", temperature=1.0),
    )
    await agent.run()

asyncio.run(main())
```

Set up your API keys in a `.env` file:

```bash
OPENAI_API_KEY=
ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=
AZURE_OPENAI_ENDPOINT=
AZURE_OPENAI_KEY=
GOOGLE_API_KEY=
DEEPSEEK_API_KEY=
GROK_API_KEY=
NOVITA_API_KEY=
```

## Web UI and CLI Testing

Test and experiment with Browser-Use using:

*   [Web UI](https://github.com/browser-use/web-ui)
*   `browser-use` interactive CLI:

```bash
pip install "browser-use[cli]"
browser-use
```

## MCP Integration

Browser-use supports the [Model Context Protocol (MCP)](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/), allowing integration with Claude Desktop and other MCP-compatible clients.

### Use as MCP Server with Claude Desktop

Add browser-use to your Claude Desktop configuration:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "browser-use": {
      "command": "uvx",
      "args": ["browser-use[cli]", "--mcp"],
      "env": {
        "OPENAI_API_KEY": "sk-..."
      }
    }
  }
}
```

### Connect External MCP Servers to Browser-Use Agent

Browser-use agents can connect to multiple external MCP servers to extend their capabilities:

```python
import asyncio
from browser_use import Agent, Controller
from browser_use.mcp.client import MCPClient
from browser_use.llm import ChatOpenAI

async def main():
    # Initialize controller
    controller = Controller()
    
    # Connect to multiple MCP servers
    filesystem_client = MCPClient(
        server_name="filesystem",
        command="npx",
        args=["-y", "@modelcontextprotocol/server-filesystem", "/Users/me/documents"]
    )
    
    github_client = MCPClient(
        server_name="github", 
        command="npx",
        args=["-y", "@modelcontextprotocol/server-github"],
        env={"GITHUB_TOKEN": "your-github-token"}
    )
    
    # Connect and register tools from both servers
    await filesystem_client.connect()
    await filesystem_client.register_to_controller(controller)
    
    await github_client.connect()
    await github_client.register_to_controller(controller)
    
    # Create agent with MCP-enabled controller
    agent = Agent(
        task="Find the latest report.pdf in my documents and create a GitHub issue about it",
        llm=ChatOpenAI(model="gpt-4o"),
        controller=controller  # Controller has tools from both MCP servers
    )
    
    # Run the agent
    await agent.run()
    
    # Cleanup
    await filesystem_client.disconnect()
    await github_client.disconnect()

asyncio.run(main())
```

See the [MCP documentation](https://docs.browser-use.com/customize/mcp-server) for more details.

## Vision

Our vision is to let you tell your computer what to do and have it get it done.

## Roadmap

### Agent

*   \[ ] Improve agent memory to handle +100 steps
*   \[ ] Enhance planning capabilities (load website specific context)
*   \[ ] Reduce token consumption (system prompt, DOM state)

### DOM Extraction

*   \[ ] Enable detection for all possible UI elements
*   \[ ] Improve state representation for UI elements so that all LLMs can understand what's on the page

### Workflows

*   \[ ] Let user record a workflow - which we can rerun with browser-use as a fallback
*   \[ ] Make rerunning of workflows work, even if pages change

### User Experience

*   \[ ] Create various templates for tutorial execution, job application, QA testing, social media, etc. which users can just copy & paste.
*   \[ ] Improve docs
*   \[ ] Make it faster

### Parallelization

*   \[ ] Human work is sequential. The real power of a browser agent comes into reality if we can parallelize similar tasks. For example, if you want to find contact information for 100 companies, this can all be done in parallel and reported back to a main agent, which processes the results and kicks off parallel subtasks again.

## Contributing

Contributions are welcome!  Feel free to open issues or submit pull requests. To contribute to the docs, go to the `/docs` folder.

## üß™ Robust Agent Testing

Ensure your agents are robust by automatically validating your tasks with our CI!

*   Add your tasks as YAML files in `tests/agent_tasks/` (see the [`README there`](tests/agent_tasks/README.md) for details).
*   Your tasks will be automatically run and evaluated on every update.

## Local Setup

For detailed information on local setup, refer to the [local setup documentation üìï](https://docs.browser-use.com/development/local-setup).

**Important:** `main` is the primary development branch.  For production use, install a stable [versioned release](https://github.com/browser-use/browser-use/releases) instead.
