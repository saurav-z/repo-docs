<p align="center"><b>Browser Use lets you control your web browser with the power of AI, automating complex tasks with simple prompts.</b></p>

Want to skip the setup? Use our <b>[cloud](https://cloud.browser-use.com)</b> for faster, scalable, stealth-enabled browser automation!

## Key Features

*   **AI-Powered Automation:** Control your browser using natural language prompts.
*   **Automated Workflows:** Automate tasks like shopping, job applications, and social media management.
*   **Cloud Integration:**  Seamlessly integrate with a cloud environment for enhanced performance and scalability.
*   **Model Context Protocol (MCP) Support:**  Integrates with MCP-compatible clients like Claude Desktop, expanding capabilities.
*   **Robust Testing:** Automated CI validation to ensure reliability.
*   **Open Source:** The source code is available on [GitHub](https://github.com/browser-use/browser-use).

## Quickstart

Install Browser Use using pip:

```bash
pip install browser-use
```

Install the latest Chromium using playwright's install shortcut:

```bash
uvx playwright install chromium --with-deps --no-shell
```

Here's a simple example to get you started:

```python
import asyncio
from dotenv import load_dotenv
load_dotenv()
from browser_use import Agent, ChatOpenAI

async def main():
    agent = Agent(
        task="Find the number of stars of the browser-use repo",
        llm=ChatOpenAI(model="gpt-4.1-mini"),
    )
    await agent.run()

asyncio.run(main())
```

Make sure to include your API keys in a `.env` file:

```bash
OPENAI_API_KEY=
```

For more detailed configuration options, consult the comprehensive [documentation](https://docs.browser-use.com).

## Model Context Protocol (MCP) Integration

Browser Use supports the [Model Context Protocol (MCP)](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/), enabling integration with Claude Desktop and other MCP-compatible clients.

### Use as MCP Server with Claude Desktop

Add browser-use to your Claude Desktop configuration:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "browser-use": {
      "command": "uvx",
      "args": ["browser-use[cli]", "--mcp"],
      "env": {
        "OPENAI_API_KEY": "sk-..."
      }
    }
  }
}
```

This gives Claude Desktop access to browser automation tools for web scraping, form filling, and more.

### Connect External MCP Servers to Browser-Use Agent

Browser-use agents can connect to multiple external MCP servers to extend their capabilities:

```python
import asyncio
from browser_use import Agent, Controller, ChatOpenAI
from browser_use.mcp.client import MCPClient

async def main():
    # Initialize controller
    controller = Controller()

    # Connect to multiple MCP servers
    filesystem_client = MCPClient(
        server_name="filesystem",
        command="npx",
        args=["-y", "@modelcontextprotocol/server-filesystem", "/Users/me/documents"]
    )

    github_client = MCPClient(
        server_name="github",
        command="npx",
        args=["-y", "@modelcontextprotocol/server-github"],
        env={"GITHUB_TOKEN": "your-github-token"}
    )

    # Connect and register tools from both servers
    await filesystem_client.connect()
    await filesystem_client.register_to_controller(controller)

    await github_client.connect()
    await github_client.register_to_controller(controller)

    # Create agent with MCP-enabled controller
    agent = Agent(
        task="Find the latest pdf report in my documents and create a GitHub issue about it",
        llm=ChatOpenAI(model="gpt-4.1-mini"),
        controller=controller  # Controller has tools from both MCP servers
    )

    # Run the agent
    await agent.run()

    # Cleanup
    await filesystem_client.disconnect()
    await github_client.disconnect()

asyncio.run(main())
```

See the [MCP documentation](https://docs.browser-use.com/customize/mcp-server) for more details.

## Vision

Our vision is to make your computer understand what you want and get it done.

## Roadmap

### Agent

*   \[ ] Make agent 3x faster
*   \[ ] Reduce token consumption (system prompt, DOM state)

### DOM Extraction

*   \[ ] Enable interaction with all UI elements
*   \[ ] Improve state representation for UI elements so that any LLM can understand what's on the page

### Workflows

*   \[ ] Let user record a workflow - which we can rerun with browser-use as a fallback

### User Experience

*   \[ ] Create various templates for tutorial execution, job application, QA testing, social media, etc. which users can just copy & paste.

### Parallelization

*   \[ ] Human work is sequential. The real power of a browser agent comes into reality if we can parallelize similar tasks. For example, if you want to find contact information for 100 companies, this can all be done in parallel and reported back to a main agent, which processes the results and kicks off parallel subtasks again.

## Contributing

We welcome contributions!  Please open issues for any bugs or feature requests.  To contribute to the documentation, check out the `/docs` folder.

## Testing Your Tasks

Improve the robustness of your agents by adding tasks to our CI:

*   **Add your task:** Create a YAML file in `tests/agent_tasks/` (see the [`README there`](tests/agent_tasks/README.md) for details).
*   **Automatic Validation:** Your task will be automatically run and evaluated on every update based on your defined criteria.

## Local Setup

For detailed information about setting up and developing Browser Use locally, please refer to the [local setup documentation](https://docs.browser-use.com/development/local-setup).

**Important:** The `main` branch represents the primary development branch with frequent updates. For stable production use, it is recommended to install a [versioned release](https://github.com/browser-use/browser-use/releases).
