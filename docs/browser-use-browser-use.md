## Quick Start

### Installation

With pip (Python>=3.11):

```bash
pip install browser-use
```

Install the browser:

```bash
playwright install chromium --with-deps --no-shell
```

### Basic Usage

Spin up your agent:

```python
import asyncio
from dotenv import load_dotenv
load_dotenv()
from browser_use import Agent
from browser_use.llm import ChatOpenAI

async def main():
    agent = Agent(
        task="Compare the price of gpt-4o and DeepSeek-V3",
        llm=ChatOpenAI(model="o4-mini", temperature=1.0),
    )
    await agent.run()

asyncio.run(main())
```

Add your API keys for the provider you want to use to your `.env` file.

```bash
OPENAI_API_KEY=
ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=
AZURE_OPENAI_ENDPOINT=
AZURE_OPENAI_KEY=
GOOGLE_API_KEY=
DEEPSEEK_API_KEY=
GROK_API_KEY=
NOVITA_API_KEY=
```

### Explore Further

*   **Documentation:**  Find detailed information on setup, usage, and customization [here](https://docs.browser-use.com).
*   **Try the Cloud:** Skip the setup and test instantly with our [hosted version](https://cloud.browser-use.com).
*   **Web UI and Desktop App:** Test browser-use using its [Web UI](https://github.com/browser-use/web-ui) or [Desktop App](https://github.com/browser-use/desktop).
*   **Interactive CLI:** Use our `browser-use` interactive CLI.

## Model Context Protocol (MCP) Integration

Browser-use supports the [Model Context Protocol (MCP)](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/), enabling integration with Claude Desktop and other MCP-compatible clients.

### Use as MCP Server with Claude Desktop

Add browser-use to your Claude Desktop configuration:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "browser-use": {
      "command": "uvx",
      "args": ["browser-use[cli]", "--mcp"],
      "env": {
        "OPENAI_API_KEY": "sk-..."
      }
    }
  }
}
```

This gives Claude Desktop access to browser automation tools for web scraping, form filling, and more.

### Connect External MCP Servers to Browser-Use Agent

Browser-use agents can connect to multiple external MCP servers to extend their capabilities:

```python
import asyncio
from browser_use import Agent, Controller
from browser_use.mcp.client import MCPClient
from browser_use.llm import ChatOpenAI

async def main():
    # Initialize controller
    controller = Controller()
    
    # Connect to multiple MCP servers
    filesystem_client = MCPClient(
        server_name="filesystem",
        command="npx",
        args=["-y", "@modelcontextprotocol/server-filesystem", "/Users/me/documents"]
    )
    
    github_client = MCPClient(
        server_name="github", 
        command="npx",
        args=["-y", "@modelcontextprotocol/server-github"],
        env={"GITHUB_TOKEN": "your-github-token"}
    )
    
    # Connect and register tools from both servers
    await filesystem_client.connect()
    await filesystem_client.register_to_controller(controller)
    
    await github_client.connect()
    await github_client.register_to_controller(controller)
    
    # Create agent with MCP-enabled controller
    agent = Agent(
        task="Find the latest report.pdf in my documents and create a GitHub issue about it",
        llm=ChatOpenAI(model="gpt-4o"),
        controller=controller  # Controller has tools from both MCP servers
    )
    
    # Run the agent
    await agent.run()
    
    # Cleanup
    await filesystem_client.disconnect()
    await github_client.disconnect()

asyncio.run(main())
```

## Vision

Enable your AI agents to perform complex tasks by giving them the power to interact with the web.

## Roadmap

### Agent

*   \[ ] Improve agent memory to handle +100 steps
*   \[ ] Enhance planning capabilities (load website specific context)
*   \[ ] Reduce token consumption (system prompt, DOM state)

### DOM Extraction

*   \[ ] Enable detection for all possible UI elements
*   \[ ] Improve state representation for UI elements so that all LLMs can understand what's on the page

### Workflows

*   \[ ] Let user record a workflow - which we can rerun with browser-use as a fallback
*   \[ ] Make rerunning of workflows work, even if pages change

### User Experience

*   \[ ] Create various templates for tutorial execution, job application, QA testing, social media, etc. which users can just copy & paste.
*   \[ ] Improve docs
*   \[ ] Make it faster

### Parallelization

*   \[ ] Human work is sequential. The real power of a browser agent comes into reality if we can parallelize similar tasks. For example, if you want to find contact information for 100 companies, this can all be done in parallel and reported back to a main agent, which processes the results and kicks off parallel subtasks again.

## Contributing

We welcome contributions! Please feel free to open issues for bug reports or feature requests. For contributing to the docs, check out the `/docs` folder.

## 🧪 Robust Agent Testing

Ensure the reliability of your agents with our CI.

*   **Add Your Task:** Submit a YAML file in `tests/agent_tasks/` (see the [`README there`](tests/agent_tasks/README.md) for details).
*   **Automated Validation:** Your task will be automatically executed and evaluated with your criteria on every update.

## Local Setup

Learn more about the library by checking out the [local setup 📕](https://docs.browser-use.com/development/local-setup).

**Note:** `main` is the primary development branch with frequent changes. For production, use a stable [versioned release](https://github.com/browser-use/browser-use/releases).
