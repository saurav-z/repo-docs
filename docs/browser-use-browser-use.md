## Quickstart

Easily install and start using Browser Use to automate your browser tasks.

**1. Installation:**

```bash
pip install browser-use
```

If you don't already have Chrome or Chromium installed, you can also download the latest Chromium using playwright's install shortcut:

```bash
uvx playwright install chromium --with-deps --no-shell
```

**2. Implement your Agent:**

```python
import asyncio
from dotenv import load_dotenv
load_dotenv()
from browser_use import Agent, ChatOpenAI

async def main():
    agent = Agent(
        task="Find the number of stars of the browser-use repo",
        llm=ChatOpenAI(model="gpt-4.1-mini"),
    )
    await agent.run()

asyncio.run(main())
```

**3. Set API Keys:**

Add your API keys for the provider you want to use to your `.env` file.

```bash
OPENAI_API_KEY=
```

For other settings, models, and more, check out the [documentation üìï](https://docs.browser-use.com).

## Model Context Protocol (MCP) Integration

Browser Use seamlessly integrates with the [Model Context Protocol (MCP)](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/), enhancing its capabilities with Claude Desktop and other MCP-compatible clients.

### Use as MCP Server with Claude Desktop

Configure Browser Use as an MCP server within Claude Desktop:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "browser-use": {
      "command": "uvx",
      "args": ["browser-use[cli]", "--mcp"],
      "env": {
        "OPENAI_API_KEY": "sk-..."
      }
    }
  }
}
```

### Connect External MCP Servers to Browser-Use Agent

Extend Browser Use agent capabilities by connecting to multiple external MCP servers:

```python
import asyncio
from browser_use import Agent, Tools, ChatOpenAI
from browser_use.mcp.client import MCPClient

async def main():
    # Initialize tools
    tools = Tools()

    # Connect to multiple MCP servers
    filesystem_client = MCPClient(
        server_name="filesystem",
        command="npx",
        args=["-y", "@modelcontextprotocol/server-filesystem", "/Users/me/documents"]
    )

    github_client = MCPClient(
        server_name="github",
        command="npx",
        args=["-y", "@modelcontextprotocol/server-github"],
        env={"GITHUB_TOKEN": "your-github-token"}
    )

    # Connect and register tools from both servers
    await filesystem_client.connect()
    await filesystem_client.register_to_tools(tools)

    await github_client.connect()
    await github_client.register_to_tools(tools)

    # Create agent with MCP-enabled tools
    agent = Agent(
        task="Find the latest pdf report in my documents and create a GitHub issue about it",
        llm=ChatOpenAI(model="gpt-4.1-mini"),
        tools=tools  # Tools has tools from both MCP servers
    )

    # Run the agent
    await agent.run()

    # Cleanup
    await filesystem_client.disconnect()
    await github_client.disconnect()

asyncio.run(main())
```

## Vision

*   Effortlessly automate web interactions through natural language.

## Roadmap

### Agent

*   Make agent 3x faster
*   Reduce token consumption (system prompt, DOM state)

### DOM Extraction

*   Enable interaction with all UI elements
*   Improve state representation for UI elements so that any LLM can understand what's on the page

### Workflows

*   Let user record a workflow - which we can rerun with browser-use as a fallback

### User Experience

*   Create various templates for tutorial execution, job application, QA testing, social media, etc. which users can just copy & paste.

### Parallelization

*   Human work is sequential. The real power of a browser agent comes into reality if we can parallelize similar tasks. For example, if you want to find contact information for 100 companies, this can all be done in parallel and reported back to a main agent, which processes the results and kicks off parallel subtasks again.

## Contributing

We welcome contributions! Please feel free to open issues for bug reports or feature requests. To contribute to the docs, check out the `/docs` folder.

## üß™ How to make your agents robust?

We offer to run your tasks in our CI‚Äîautomatically, on every update!

-   **Add your task:** Add a YAML file in `tests/agent_tasks/` (see the [`README there`](tests/agent_tasks/README.md) for details).
-   **Automatic validation:** Every time we push updates, your task will be run by the agent and evaluated using your criteria.

## Local Setup

Learn more about the library with our [local setup üìï](https://docs.browser-use.com/development/local-setup).

**Important:** `main` is the active development branch. For stable production use, please install a [versioned release](https://github.com/browser-use/browser-use/releases).
