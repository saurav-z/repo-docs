**Browser Use empowers you to control your web browser with AI, automating tasks and streamlining your workflow.**

## Key Features

*   **AI-Powered Automation:** Control your browser using natural language prompts.
*   **Cloud Integration:** Utilize the [cloud](https://cloud.browser-use.com) for faster and stealth-enabled automation.
*   **Python Library:** Easily integrate browser automation into your Python projects.
*   **Model Context Protocol (MCP) Support:** Integrate with Claude Desktop and other MCP-compatible clients.
*   **Robust Agent Tasks:** Automated testing to ensure your agents are reliable.
*   **Extensive Documentation:** Comprehensive documentation for easy setup and customization.

## Quick Start

Install Browser Use using pip:

```bash
pip install browser-use
```

If you don't already have Chrome or Chromium installed, install Chromium with playwright's install shortcut:

```bash
uvx playwright install chromium --with-deps --no-shell
```

Here's a simple example to get you started:

```python
import asyncio
from dotenv import load_dotenv
load_dotenv()
from browser_use import Agent, ChatOpenAI

async def main():
    agent = Agent(
        task="Find the number of stars of the browser-use repo",
        llm=ChatOpenAI(model="gpt-4.1-mini"),
    )
    await agent.run()

asyncio.run(main())
```

Remember to add your API keys for the desired provider to your `.env` file.  For detailed instructions and customization options, refer to the [documentation üìï](https://docs.browser-use.com).

## Model Context Protocol (MCP) Integration

Browser Use seamlessly integrates with the Model Context Protocol (MCP), enhancing compatibility with tools like Claude Desktop.

### Use as MCP Server with Claude Desktop

Configure Claude Desktop to use Browser Use as an MCP server:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "browser-use": {
      "command": "uvx",
      "args": ["browser-use[cli]", "--mcp"],
      "env": {
        "OPENAI_API_KEY": "sk-..."
      }
    }
  }
}
```

### Connect External MCP Servers to Browser-Use Agent

Extend the capabilities of your Browser Use agents by connecting to multiple external MCP servers:

```python
import asyncio
from browser_use import Agent, Tools, ChatOpenAI
from browser_use.mcp.client import MCPClient

async def main():
    # Initialize tools
    tools = Tools()

    # Connect to multiple MCP servers
    filesystem_client = MCPClient(
        server_name="filesystem",
        command="npx",
        args=["-y", "@modelcontextprotocol/server-filesystem", "/Users/me/documents"]
    )

    github_client = MCPClient(
        server_name="github",
        command="npx",
        args=["-y", "@modelcontextprotocol/server-github"],
        env={"GITHUB_TOKEN": "your-github-token"}
    )

    # Connect and register tools from both servers
    await filesystem_client.connect()
    await filesystem_client.register_to_tools(tools)

    await github_client.connect()
    await github_client.register_to_tools(tools)

    # Create agent with MCP-enabled tools
    agent = Agent(
        task="Find the latest pdf report in my documents and create a GitHub issue about it",
        llm=ChatOpenAI(model="gpt-4.1-mini"),
        tools=tools  # Tools has tools from both MCP servers
    )

    # Run the agent
    await agent.run()

    # Cleanup
    await filesystem_client.disconnect()
    await github_client.disconnect()

asyncio.run(main())
```

Refer to the [MCP documentation](https://docs.browser-use.com/customize/mcp-server) for advanced usage.

## Vision

We envision a future where you can effortlessly control your computer with natural language.

## Roadmap

We're constantly improving Browser Use.  Here's what we're working on:

*   **Agent:**
    *   Make the agent 3x faster.
    *   Reduce token consumption (system prompt, DOM state).
*   **DOM Extraction:**
    *   Enable interaction with all UI elements.
    *   Improve state representation for UI elements.
*   **Workflows:**
    *   Let users record workflows for later re-execution.
*   **User Experience:**
    *   Create templates for common use cases (tutorials, job applications, etc.).
*   **Parallelization:**
    *   Enable parallel execution of similar tasks.

## Contributing

We welcome contributions!  Report bugs and suggest features by opening issues.  Contribute to the docs in the `/docs` folder.

## üß™ How to Make Your Agents Robust?

Ensure the reliability of your agents by adding your tasks to our CI:

*   **Add a YAML file:** Place your YAML file in `tests/agent_tasks/` (see the [`README there`](tests/agent_tasks/README.md) for instructions).
*   **Automatic validation:** Your task will be automatically executed and evaluated with every update.

## Local Setup

To learn more about setting up the library for local development, check out the [local setup üìï](https://docs.browser-use.com/development/local-setup).

**Important:** `main` is the active development branch. For production, use a [versioned release](https://github.com/browser-use/browser-use/releases).
