**Empower your AI to navigate the web effortlessly with Browser Use, the cutting-edge tool for browser automation.**  [Explore the Browser Use repository on GitHub](https://github.com/browser-use/browser-use).

## Key Features

*   **AI-Powered Automation:** Control your browser with natural language instructions.
*   **Easy Integration:**  Simple Python installation and setup.
*   **Cloud-Ready:**  Skip the setup with the hosted cloud version.
*   **MCP Integration:** Seamlessly integrate with the Model Context Protocol for enhanced functionality.
*   **Robustness Testing:** Built-in CI/CD for automated testing of agent tasks.
*   **Interactive CLI:** Test and experiment with a convenient command-line interface.
*   **Community Support:** Connect with other developers and share projects on our Discord server.

## Quick Start

Install the package and dependencies with pip:

```bash
pip install browser-use
playwright install chromium --with-deps --no-shell
```

Get started with this Python example:

```python
import asyncio
from dotenv import load_dotenv
load_dotenv()
from browser_use import Agent
from browser_use.llm import ChatOpenAI

async def main():
    agent = Agent(
        task="Compare the price of gpt-4o and DeepSeek-V3",
        llm=ChatOpenAI(model="o4-mini", temperature=1.0),
    )
    await agent.run()

asyncio.run(main())
```

Remember to set your API keys in a `.env` file:

```bash
OPENAI_API_KEY=
ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=
AZURE_OPENAI_ENDPOINT=
AZURE_OPENAI_KEY=
GOOGLE_API_KEY=
DEEPSEEK_API_KEY=
GROK_API_KEY=
NOVITA_API_KEY=
```

## Test and Deploy

*   **Web UI & Desktop App:** Test browser-use using its [Web UI](https://github.com/browser-use/web-ui) or [Desktop App](https://github.com/browser-use/desktop).
*   **Interactive CLI:** Use the `browser-use` interactive CLI for immediate testing:

    ```bash
    pip install "browser-use[cli]"
    browser-use
    ```

## MCP Integration

Browser-use supports the [Model Context Protocol (MCP)](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/) for extended functionality.

### Use as MCP Server with Claude Desktop

Configure Claude Desktop to leverage browser automation:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "browser-use": {
      "command": "uvx",
      "args": ["browser-use[cli]", "--mcp"],
      "env": {
        "OPENAI_API_KEY": "sk-..."
      }
    }
  }
}
```

### Connect External MCP Servers to Browser-Use Agent

Extend agent capabilities by connecting to multiple external MCP servers:

```python
import asyncio
from browser_use import Agent, Controller
from browser_use.mcp.client import MCPClient
from browser_use.llm import ChatOpenAI

async def main():
    # Initialize controller
    controller = Controller()
    
    # Connect to multiple MCP servers
    filesystem_client = MCPClient(
        server_name="filesystem",
        command="npx",
        args=["-y", "@modelcontextprotocol/server-filesystem", "/Users/me/documents"]
    )
    
    github_client = MCPClient(
        server_name="github", 
        command="npx",
        args=["-y", "@modelcontextprotocol/server-github"],
        env={"GITHUB_TOKEN": "your-github-token"}
    )
    
    # Connect and register tools from both servers
    await filesystem_client.connect()
    await filesystem_client.register_to_controller(controller)
    
    await github_client.connect()
    await github_client.register_to_controller(controller)
    
    # Create agent with MCP-enabled controller
    agent = Agent(
        task="Find the latest report.pdf in my documents and create a GitHub issue about it",
        llm=ChatOpenAI(model="gpt-4o"),
        controller=controller  # Controller has tools from both MCP servers
    )
    
    # Run the agent
    await agent.run()
    
    # Cleanup
    await filesystem_client.disconnect()
    await github_client.disconnect()

asyncio.run(main())
```

## Vision

Make it easy for anyone to instruct their computer by the use of natural language and have it carry out tasks.

## Roadmap

### Agent

*   \[ ] Improve agent memory to handle +100 steps
*   \[ ] Enhance planning capabilities (load website specific context)
*   \[ ] Reduce token consumption (system prompt, DOM state)

### DOM Extraction

*   \[ ] Enable detection for all possible UI elements
*   \[ ] Improve state representation for UI elements so that all LLMs can understand what's on the page

### Workflows

*   \[ ] Let user record a workflow - which we can rerun with browser-use as a fallback
*   \[ ] Make rerunning of workflows work, even if pages change

### User Experience

*   \[ ] Create various templates for tutorial execution, job application, QA testing, social media, etc. which users can just copy & paste.
*   \[ ] Improve docs
*   \[ ] Make it faster

### Parallelization

*   \[ ] Human work is sequential. The real power of a browser agent comes into reality if we can parallelize similar tasks. For example, if you want to find contact information for 100 companies, this can all be done in parallel and reported back to a main agent, which processes the results and kicks off parallel subtasks again.

## Contributing

We welcome contributions! Please open issues for bug reports or feature requests.  Contribute to the documentation by checking out the `/docs` folder.

## üß™ Robustness Testing

Ensure your agents are always working correctly.  Add a YAML file in `tests/agent_tasks/` with your task details (see the [`README`](tests/agent_tasks/README.md) for guidance). Your task will be automatically validated with every update.

## Local Setup

Learn more about the library in the [local setup üìï](https://docs.browser-use.com/development/local-setup).

**Important Note:** `main` is the primary development branch. For production use, install a stable [versioned release](https://github.com/browser-use/browser-use/releases).
