## Quickstart

Install Browser Use using pip (Python>=3.11):

```bash
pip install browser-use
```

If you don't have Chrome or Chromium installed, use Playwright to download Chromium:

```bash
uvx playwright install chromium --with-deps --no-shell
```

Spin up your agent:

```python
import asyncio
from dotenv import load_dotenv
load_dotenv()
from browser_use import Agent, ChatOpenAI

async def main():
    agent = Agent(
        task="Find the number of stars of the browser-use repo",
        llm=ChatOpenAI(model="gpt-4.1-mini"),
    )
    await agent.run()

asyncio.run(main())
```

**Important:** Add your API keys to a `.env` file (e.g., `OPENAI_API_KEY=YOUR_API_KEY`).

For detailed configuration options and model settings, explore the comprehensive [documentation üìï](https://docs.browser-use.com).

## Model Context Protocol (MCP) Integration

Browser Use seamlessly integrates with the [Model Context Protocol (MCP)](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/) enabling compatibility with Claude Desktop and other MCP-compliant clients.

### Using as an MCP Server with Claude Desktop

Configure Claude Desktop to leverage browser-use:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "browser-use": {
      "command": "uvx",
      "args": ["browser-use[cli]", "--mcp"],
      "env": {
        "OPENAI_API_KEY": "sk-..."
      }
    }
  }
}
```

### Connecting External MCP Servers to Browser-Use Agent

Extend your agent's capabilities by connecting to multiple MCP servers:

```python
import asyncio
from browser_use import Agent, Tools, ChatOpenAI
from browser_use.mcp.client import MCPClient

async def main():
    # Initialize tools
    tools = Tools()

    # Connect to multiple MCP servers
    filesystem_client = MCPClient(
        server_name="filesystem",
        command="npx",
        args=["-y", "@modelcontextprotocol/server-filesystem", "/Users/me/documents"]
    )

    github_client = MCPClient(
        server_name="github",
        command="npx",
        args=["-y", "@modelcontextprotocol/server-github"],
        env={"GITHUB_TOKEN": "your-github-token"}
    )

    # Connect and register tools from both servers
    await filesystem_client.connect()
    await filesystem_client.register_to_tools(tools)

    await github_client.connect()
    await github_client.register_to_tools(tools)

    # Create agent with MCP-enabled tools
    agent = Agent(
        task="Find the latest pdf report in my documents and create a GitHub issue about it",
        llm=ChatOpenAI(model="gpt-4.1-mini"),
        tools=tools  # Tools has tools from both MCP servers
    )

    # Run the agent
    await agent.run()

    # Cleanup
    await filesystem_client.disconnect()
    await github_client.disconnect()

asyncio.run(main())
```

Refer to the [MCP documentation](https://docs.browser-use.com/customize/mcp-server) for details.

## Vision

Our vision is to enable users to control their browser with natural language.

## Roadmap

### Agent

*   [ ] Make agent 3x faster
*   [ ] Reduce token consumption (system prompt, DOM state)

### DOM Extraction

*   [ ] Enable interaction with all UI elements
*   [ ] Improve state representation for UI elements so that any LLM can understand what's on the page

### Workflows

*   [ ] Let user record a workflow - which we can rerun with browser-use as a fallback

### User Experience

*   [ ] Create various templates for tutorial execution, job application, QA testing, social media, etc. which users can just copy & paste.

### Parallelization

*   [ ] Human work is sequential. The real power of a browser agent comes into reality if we can parallelize similar tasks. For example, if you want to find contact information for 100 companies, this can all be done in parallel and reported back to a main agent, which processes the results and kicks off parallel subtasks again.

## Contributing

We welcome contributions! Please open issues for bugs or feature requests.  For documentation contributions, see the `/docs` folder.

## üß™ Task Validation

Enhance your agent's reliability by running your tasks in our CI.

*   **Add your task:** Add a YAML file in `tests/agent_tasks/` (see the [`README there`](tests/agent_tasks/README.md) for details).
*   **Automatic validation:** Your task will be automatically run and evaluated with every update.

## Local Setup

Learn more about the library with our [local setup üìï](https://docs.browser-use.com/development/local-setup).

**Note:**  `main` is the primary development branch.  For production, install a [versioned release](https://github.com/browser-use/browser-use/releases).
