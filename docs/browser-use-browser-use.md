## Quick Start

### Installation

```bash
pip install browser-use
```

### Browser Setup

```bash
playwright install chromium --with-deps --no-shell
```

### Example Usage

```python
import asyncio
from dotenv import load_dotenv
load_dotenv()
from browser_use import Agent
from browser_use.llm import ChatOpenAI

async def main():
    agent = Agent(
        task="Compare the price of gpt-4o and DeepSeek-V3",
        llm=ChatOpenAI(model="o4-mini", temperature=1.0),
    )
    await agent.run()

asyncio.run(main())
```

*   Remember to add your API keys to your `.env` file.  See the [documentation üìï](https://docs.browser-use.com) for details on settings and models.

### Interactive CLI

```bash
pip install "browser-use[cli]"
browser-use
```

## Model Context Protocol (MCP) Integration

Browser Use seamlessly integrates with the Model Context Protocol (MCP) to provide enhanced functionality.

### Use as MCP Server with Claude Desktop

Integrate Browser Use into your Claude Desktop configuration:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "browser-use": {
      "command": "uvx",
      "args": ["browser-use[cli]", "--mcp"],
      "env": {
        "OPENAI_API_KEY": "sk-..."
      }
    }
  }
}
```

### Connect External MCP Servers to Browser-Use Agent

Browser-use agents can connect to multiple external MCP servers to extend their capabilities:

```python
import asyncio
from browser_use import Agent, Controller
from browser_use.mcp.client import MCPClient
from browser_use.llm import ChatOpenAI

async def main():
    # Initialize controller
    controller = Controller()
    
    # Connect to multiple MCP servers
    filesystem_client = MCPClient(
        server_name="filesystem",
        command="npx",
        args=["-y", "@modelcontextprotocol/server-filesystem", "/Users/me/documents"]
    )
    
    github_client = MCPClient(
        server_name="github", 
        command="npx",
        args=["-y", "@modelcontextprotocol/server-github"],
        env={"GITHUB_TOKEN": "your-github-token"}
    )
    
    # Connect and register tools from both servers
    await filesystem_client.connect()
    await filesystem_client.register_to_controller(controller)
    
    await github_client.connect()
    await github_client.register_to_controller(controller)
    
    # Create agent with MCP-enabled controller
    agent = Agent(
        task="Find the latest report.pdf in my documents and create a GitHub issue about it",
        llm=ChatOpenAI(model="gpt-4o"),
        controller=controller  # Controller has tools from both MCP servers
    )
    
    # Run the agent
    await agent.run()
    
    # Cleanup
    await filesystem_client.disconnect()
    await github_client.disconnect()

asyncio.run(main())
```
*   For more details, see the [MCP documentation](https://docs.browser-use.com/customize/mcp-server).

## Vision

Browser Use aims to make browser automation intuitive and powerful, allowing users to control the web with simple instructions.

## Roadmap

### Agent

*   [ ] Improve agent memory to handle +100 steps
*   [ ] Enhance planning capabilities (load website specific context)
*   [ ] Reduce token consumption (system prompt, DOM state)

### DOM Extraction

*   [ ] Enable detection for all possible UI elements
*   [ ] Improve state representation for UI elements so that all LLMs can understand what's on the page

### Workflows

*   [ ] Let user record a workflow - which we can rerun with browser-use as a fallback
*   [ ] Make rerunning of workflows work, even if pages change

### User Experience

*   [ ] Create various templates for tutorial execution, job application, QA testing, social media, etc. which users can just copy & paste.
*   [ ] Improve docs
*   [ ] Make it faster

### Parallelization

*   [ ] Human work is sequential. The real power of a browser agent comes into reality if we can parallelize similar tasks. For example, if you want to find contact information for 100 companies, this can all be done in parallel and reported back to a main agent, which processes the results and kicks off parallel subtasks again.

## Contributing

We welcome contributions!  Please open issues for bugs or feature requests.  Contribute to the docs in the `/docs` folder.

## Robust Agent Testing

Automated task validation is available through our CI.

*   **Add your task:** Add a YAML file in `tests/agent_tasks/` (see the [`README there`](tests/agent_tasks/README.md) for details).
*   **Automatic validation:** Your task will be run and evaluated with every update.

## Local Setup

See the [local setup üìï](https://docs.browser-use.com/development/local-setup) in the documentation for more information.

*   Install a [versioned release](https://github.com/browser-use/browser-use/releases) for production use.
