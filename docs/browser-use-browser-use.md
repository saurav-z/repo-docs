Install Chromium (if you don't have it) with playwright's install shortcut:

```bash
uvx playwright install chromium --with-deps --no-shell
```

Example Usage:

```python
import asyncio
from dotenv import load_dotenv
load_dotenv()
from browser_use import Agent, ChatOpenAI

async def main():
    agent = Agent(
        task="Find the number of stars of the browser-use repo",
        llm=ChatOpenAI(model="gpt-4.1-mini"),
    )
    await agent.run()

asyncio.run(main())
```

Remember to add your API keys to your `.env` file. Check out the [documentation üìï](https://docs.browser-use.com) for more details.

## Model Context Protocol (MCP) Integration

Browser-use supports the [Model Context Protocol (MCP)](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/), enabling integration with Claude Desktop and other MCP-compatible clients.

### Use as MCP Server with Claude Desktop

Add browser-use to your Claude Desktop configuration:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "browser-use": {
      "command": "uvx",
      "args": ["browser-use[cli]", "--mcp"],
      "env": {
        "OPENAI_API_KEY": "sk-..."
      }
    }
  }
}
```

This gives Claude Desktop access to browser automation tools for web scraping, form filling, and more.

### Connect External MCP Servers to Browser-Use Agent

Browser-use agents can connect to multiple external MCP servers to extend their capabilities:

```python
import asyncio
from browser_use import Agent, Tools, ChatOpenAI
from browser_use.mcp.client import MCPClient

async def main():
    # Initialize tools
    tools = Tools()

    # Connect to multiple MCP servers
    filesystem_client = MCPClient(
        server_name="filesystem",
        command="npx",
        args=["-y", "@modelcontextprotocol/server-filesystem", "/Users/me/documents"]
    )

    github_client = MCPClient(
        server_name="github",
        command="npx",
        args=["-y", "@modelcontextprotocol/server-github"],
        env={"GITHUB_TOKEN": "your-github-token"}
    )

    # Connect and register tools from both servers
    await filesystem_client.connect()
    await filesystem_client.register_to_tools(tools)

    await github_client.connect()
    await github_client.register_to_tools(tools)

    # Create agent with MCP-enabled tools
    agent = Agent(
        task="Find the latest pdf report in my documents and create a GitHub issue about it",
        llm=ChatOpenAI(model="gpt-4.1-mini"),
        tools=tools  # Tools has tools from both MCP servers
    )

    # Run the agent
    await agent.run()

    # Cleanup
    await filesystem_client.disconnect()
    await github_client.disconnect()

asyncio.run(main())
```

See the [MCP documentation](https://docs.browser-use.com/customize/mcp-server) for more details.

## Vision

Our goal is to enable users to simply tell their computer what to do, and have it executed.

## Roadmap

### Agent

*   \[ ] Make agent 3x faster
*   \[ ] Reduce token consumption (system prompt, DOM state)

### DOM Extraction

*   \[ ] Enable interaction with all UI elements
*   \[ ] Improve state representation for UI elements so that any LLM can understand what's on the page

### Workflows

*   \[ ] Let user record a workflow - which we can rerun with browser-use as a fallback

### User Experience

*   \[ ] Create various templates for tutorial execution, job application, QA testing, social media, etc. which users can just copy & paste.

### Parallelization

*   \[ ] Human work is sequential. The real power of a browser agent comes into reality if we can parallelize similar tasks. For example, if you want to find contact information for 100 companies, this can all be done in parallel and reported back to a main agent, which processes the results and kicks off parallel subtasks again.

## Contributing

We welcome contributions!  Please open issues for bug reports and feature requests. To contribute to the documentation, check out the `/docs` folder.

## üß™ Robust Agent Tasks

Ensure your tasks run smoothly with our automatic CI validation!

*   **Add your task:** Add a YAML file in `tests/agent_tasks/` (see the [`README there`](tests/agent_tasks/README.md) for details).
*   **Automatic validation:**  Our CI will run your task and evaluate it based on your criteria.

## Local Setup

To learn more about the library, check out the [local setup üìï](https://docs.browser-use.com/development/local-setup).

`main` is the primary development branch. For production, use a [versioned release](https://github.com/browser-use/browser-use/releases).
