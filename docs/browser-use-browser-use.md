## Getting Started

### Installation

Install Browser Use using pip:

```

### Example Usage

Here's a basic example to get you started:

```python

load_dotenv()
from browser_use import Agent, ChatOpenAI

async def main():
    agent = Agent(
        task="Find the number of stars of the browser-use repo",
        llm=ChatOpenAI(model="gpt-4.1-mini"),
    )
    await agent.run()

asyncio.run(main())
```

## Model Context Protocol (MCP) Integration

Browser Use supports the [Model Context Protocol (MCP)](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/), allowing integration with tools like Claude Desktop.

### Using as an MCP Server

Configure Claude Desktop to use Browser Use:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "browser-use": {
      "command": "uvx",
      "args": ["browser-use[cli]", "--mcp"],
      "env": {
        "OPENAI_API_KEY": "sk-..."
      }
    }
  }
}
```

### Connecting to External MCP Servers

Extend Browser Use's capabilities by connecting to multiple MCP servers:

```python
import asyncio
from browser_use import Agent, Controller, ChatOpenAI
from browser_use.mcp.client import MCPClient

async def main():
    # Initialize controller
    controller = Controller()

    # Connect to multiple MCP servers
    filesystem_client = MCPClient(
        server_name="filesystem",
        command="npx",
        args=["-y", "@modelcontextprotocol/server-filesystem", "/Users/me/documents"]
    )

    github_client = MCPClient(
        server_name="github",
        command="npx",
        args=["-y", "@modelcontextprotocol/server-github"],
        env={"GITHUB_TOKEN": "your-github-token"}
    )

    # Connect and register tools from both servers
    await filesystem_client.connect()
    await filesystem_client.register_to_controller(controller)

    await github_client.connect()
    await github_client.register_to_controller(controller)

    # Create agent with MCP-enabled controller
    agent = Agent(
        task="Find the latest pdf report in my documents and create a GitHub issue about it",
        llm=ChatOpenAI(model="gpt-4.1-mini"),
        controller=controller  # Controller has tools from both MCP servers
    )

    # Run the agent
    await agent.run()

    # Cleanup
    await filesystem_client.disconnect()
    await github_client.disconnect()

asyncio.run(main())
```

For further details, consult the [MCP documentation](https://docs.browser-use.com/customize/mcp-server).

## Vision

**The future is simple: Tell your computer what to do, and it gets it done.**

## Roadmap

### Agent

*   \[ ] Make agent 3x faster
*   \[ ] Reduce token consumption (system prompt, DOM state)

### DOM Extraction

*   \[ ] Enable interaction with all UI elements
*   \[ ] Improve state representation for UI elements so that any LLM can understand what's on the page

### Workflows

*   \[ ] Let user record a workflow - which we can rerun with browser-use as a fallback

### User Experience

*   \[ ] Create various templates for tutorial execution, job application, QA testing, social media, etc. which users can just copy & paste.

### Parallelization

*   \[ ] Human work is sequential. The real power of a browser agent comes into reality if we can parallelize similar tasks. For example, if you want to find contact information for 100 companies, this can all be done in parallel and reported back to a main agent, which processes the results and kicks off parallel subtasks again.

## Contributing

We welcome contributions! Please submit issues for bug reports and feature requests.  Contribute to the documentation in the `/docs` folder.

## üß™ Robust Agent Testing

Ensure your tasks run correctly with our CI!

*   **Add your task:** Add a YAML file in `tests/agent_tasks/` (see the [`README there`](tests/agent_tasks/README.md) for details).
*   **Automated validation:** Your task will be automatically run and evaluated with every update.

## Local Setup

For detailed local setup instructions, see the [local setup üìï](https://docs.browser-use.com/development/local-setup).

**Note:** The `main` branch is for active development.  For production, use a [versioned release](https://github.com/browser-use/browser-use/releases).
